                <p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive remediation (CR) is a psychological therapy, effective
in improving cognitive performance and functioning in people with schizophrenia. As the
therapy becomes more widely implemented within mental health services its longevity and
uptake is likely to depend on its feasibility and acceptability to service users and
clinicians. <bold>Aims:</bold> To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a new
strategy-based computerized CR programme (CIRCuiTS) for people with psychosis.
<bold>Method:</bold> Four studies were conducted using mixed methods. Perceptions of
attractiveness, comprehensibility, acceptability and usability were assessed using
self-report questionnaires in 34 non-clinical participants (study 1), and five people with
a schizophrenia diagnosis and three experienced CR therapists (studies 2 and 3). The ease
with which pre-specified therapy programmes could be assembled was also assessed by three
therapists (Study 2). Finally, the satisfaction of 20 service users with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia regarding their experience of using CIRCuiTS in the context of a course of
the CR therapy was assessed in a qualitative interview study (study 4).
<bold>Results:</bold> Ratings of perceived attractiveness, comprehensibility,
acceptability and usability consistently exceeded pre-set high targets by non-clinical,
clinical and therapist participants. Qualitative analysis of satisfaction with CIRCuiTS
showed that receiving the therapy was generally seen to be a positive experience, leading
to perceptions that cognitive functioning had improved and attempts to incorporate new
strategy use into daily activities. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> CIRCuiTS demonstrates high
acceptability and ease of use for both service users with a schizophrenia diagnosis and
clinicians.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cognitive Remediation (CR) is a psychological therapy to improve thinking skills, and is
effective in improving cognitive performance and functional outcomes in people with a
diagnosis of schizophrenia (Wykes, Huddy, Cellard, McGurk and Czobor, <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Consequently it is beginning to be recommended by governmental
guidelines (e.g. SIGN, <xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and the field is
moving towards widespread implementation and identifying critical factors for an effective
and easy-to-implement therapy (Wykes and Spaulding, <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>CR programs are largely based on the core principles of massed practice, error-less
learning and self-motivation, but procedural and implementation differences are common, in
terms of method of delivery, design interface, reliance on a therapist, and the frequency
and length of sessions. Furthermore, CR programmes differ in the extent of their focus on
the transfer of cognitive skills to general functioning, but generally, approaches
incorporating elements of strategy-development as well as adjunctive rehabilitation have
been more effective for functional improvements (Wykes et al., <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>Computerized delivery may be particularly attractive as there is growing consensus that
intensive and prolonged engagement is required (Keefe et al., <xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and access to psychological therapists is scarce. Pragmatic
factors such as these are likely to play an important part in driving the selection of a CR
programme for health service implementation. Most crucially, the uptake and durability is
likely to be influenced by its acceptability to users (e.g. Drake, Csipke and Wykes, <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, most CR programmes have been designed
for no specific diagnostic group, or with little user consultation. This may be particularly
important as evidence emerges to emphasize the pivotal role of intrinsic motivation in
promoting positive outcomes following CR (Medalia and Richardson, <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). It is also reflected in a more general consensus that a key
priority in the development of treatment programmes and research is service user involvement
(e.g. Department of Health, <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). A recent
systematic review of 12 studies of the acceptability and feasibility of internet and
mobile-based interventions for people with psychosis included no studies of CR, and
concluded that although most programmes were used effectively and perceived as positive and
useful, relevant research is currently in its early stages (Alvarez-Jiminez et al., <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our team developed a new CR programme for people with a schizophrenia diagnosis, namely
CIRCuiTS (Computerized Interactive Remediation of Cognition â a Training for Schizophrenia;
Reeder and Wykes, 2010) to bring together (a) existing knowledge regarding best practice to
promote cognitive and functional change; and (b) feasibility of implementation. It is
ambitious in fostering the transfer of new cognitive skills to everyday life within the
programme itself, rather than relying on bridging sessions or adjunctive rehabilitation.
This is underpinned by a model that suggests that cognitive skills will only be used to
benefit everyday functioning if (a) metacognitive knowledge about (i) one's own strengths
and difficulties, and (ii) how thinking skills and strategies can impact behaviour in
general, and (b) metacognitive regulation of one's own behaviour (cf executive functioning)
are both used to guide the adoption of new behaviours (Wykes and Reeder, <xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This model is gaining initial support from
evidence that executive function changes are better predictors of functional change in
schizophrenia than change in basic cognitive processes (e.g. Reeder et al., <xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Reeder, Newton, Frangou and Wykes, <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Reeder, Smedley, Butt, Bogner and Wykes, <xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p>
              <p>CIRCuiTS has a strong emphasis on individual tailoring. It is a modular system that is
adaptable to: (i) different cognitive problems, as therapists can create therapy programmes
composed of any combination of differently focused cognitive tasks; (ii) different cognitive
abilities, through task selection and artificial intelligence systems that adjust task
difficulty; (iii) different languages; (iv) cultural differences through ready accessibility
to content changes (Press, Drake and Husain, <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and (v) settings, available in both online and offline versions and for
therapist-led sessions and independent homework sessions. Second, its development has been
based on consultation with service users with a schizophrenia diagnosis. It is this process
that is reported in this paper.</p>
              <p>Service user involvement relies on the premise that involving patients directly in service
or research development will lead to more accessible and acceptable services or studies
(Barker, Bullen and de Ville, <xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), by eliciting
unique viewpoints and specific expertise by experience (Ennis and Wykes, <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). There has been a growing emphasis on ensuring
very early service user involvement in translational research to optimize the chance that
outputs â such as a computerized therapy programme â will be appropriately designed for
their end users (Callard, Rose and Wykes, <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sec2">
              <title>Aims</title>
              <p>We report four studies, using mixed methods, to ensure maximum usability and acceptability
to users of CIRCuiTS. The general public, service users with a schizophrenia diagnosis and
therapists took part. In particular, we were interested in ensuring that all groups found
the programme (a) attractive, (b) culturally acceptable, (c) easy to understand and (d) easy
to use.</p>
              <p>These studies formed part of a comprehensive, development programme in which we took an
initial version 1 (v1) prototype of CIRCuiTS, which had already undergone a first stage of
feasibility testing, through an iterative development process, to a final completed version
(v2.1), which was then tested in a feasibility randomized controlled trial. The aims of the
four studies were: <list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>To investigate perceptions of attractiveness, comprehensibility, acceptability and
usability of CIRCuiTS v1 and v2 within: <list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>a</label><p>a non-clinical sample</p></list-item><list-item><label>b</label><p>a sample of people with a schizophrenia diagnosis</p></list-item><list-item><label>c</label><p>experienced CR therapists.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>To assess the ease with which pre-specified therapy programmes can be assembled by

schizophrenia regarding their experience of using CIRCuiTS in the context of a course
of the CR therapy.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>CIRCuiTS has already been subject to independent investigation in a naturalistic randomized
controlled trial (RCT) in which it was combined with cognitive behaviour therapy for
psychosis (CBTp) in a first episode sample (Drake et al., <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). CBTp courses preceded by CIRCuiTS were significantly shorter but achieved
the same outcome as CBTp preceded by an active control.</p>
              <sec id="sec2-1">
                <title>Description of CIRCuiTS</title>
                <p>CIRCuiTS is a web-based computerized CR programme, with alternative offline
installations, delivered primarily by a therapist but also carried out independently. It
is based around a virtual âvillageâ and the tasks take place in relevant buildings. There
are 27 tasks, each with at least 12 difficulty levels, which are partially regulated by
artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p><italic>A focus on transfer within the programme</italic>. Tasks are divided into two
types: âabstract tasksâ, and âexercisesâ. Abstract tasks have neutral content (e.g. number
or geometrical shapes) and are designed to target specific cognitive functions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig001">Figure 1</xref>). They are predominant in the early phase of
the programme and gradually become more interspersed. <fig id="fig001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>CIRCuiTS abstract task</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S1352465815000168_fig1"/></fig></p>
                <p>Exercises are more complex, ecologically-valid tasks, which require multiple cognitive
functions, particularly executive functions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig002">Figure
2</xref>). They fall within five categories: work, social situations, cooking, shopping,
and travelling. They are gradually introduced throughout the programme. This is one of the
ways in which generalization is specifically targeted within the CR programme itself. In
addition, the programme and therapist make explicit attempts to encourage the service user
to draw parallels between within-session tasks and everyday life and to rehearse new
skills in vivo. <fig id="fig002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>CIRCuiTS exercise</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S1352465815000168_fig2"/></fig></p>
                <p><italic>Metacognitive model implementation into the programme</italic>. The development
of metacognition is explicitly targeted through a âmetacognitive journeyâ: (1)
introduction to CIRCuiTS; (2) your goals; (3) your strategies; (4) your daily life; and
(5) your achievements. Service users set goals and identify personal strengths and
difficulties, which are regularly reviewed and modified.</p>
                <p>Learning supports accompany each task to encourage metacognition. Before each task,
service users (a) rate the anticipated difficulty of the task; (b) estimate how long the

                <p>The therapist also focuses on metacognition: the service user is encouraged to adopt a
systematic approach: planning, implementation and review. They also work collaboratively
to gain an understanding of the service user's own cognitive and non-cognitive (e.g. mood,
sleep, medication effects, beliefs, environment) strengths and difficulties that affect
performance. Based on this shared understanding, the service user develops a personalized
flexible set of strategies.</p>

CIRCuiTSv1.1 content was viewed by at least one participant. At the end of each session,
the participant completed the Self-Assessment Measure 1 (SAM1). They were paid for their
participation.</p>
                  <p>The three therapists completed the Therapist Assessment Measure (TAM) following a
1-hour demonstration of CIRCuiTSv1.1. They then assembled five pre-specified therapy
programmes to test ease of use following a brief training (10 minutes), and then
completed the Therapist Semi-Structured Interview (TSSI). The target time for assembling
each therapy programme was 20 minutes.</p>

performance targets were pre-specified and minimum target decisions approved. In

the online help. These results are all shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl003">Table 3</xref>.</p>
                  <p>For the TAM, only the specific rating of understanding of the demonstration tasks fell

were built addressing the specific concerns of therapists (that the speed of
demonstration was too rapid).</p>

a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia; at least 1 year contact with mental health services;

by convenience, but these were amongst the first people to complete participation in the
RCT. Eighteen of the consented individuals had completed the therapy and two dropped out

perceived lack of cognitive difficulties). All but one participant was taking atypical

incorporate aspects specific to CIRCuiTS (such as computer use). Interview topics
included: (i) computer use; (ii) interaction with the therapist; (iii) acceptability of
CIRCuiTS tasks; (iv) perceived cognitive changes; (v) general well-being; (vi) positive
and negative aspects of the therapy; and (vii) ending the therapy.</p>

or planning. Some said that the therapy alone was not enough to change their general
thinking skills, but mentioned other benefits such as improving their confidence which
had, in turn, allowed them to function better in everyday situations. Others felt that it
had done neither, but had simply been enjoyable, fun, or provided a routine.</p>

                <p>The majority of participants said they had applied strategies learnt during the therapy
to real life situations (all were asked directly about this, and prompted to provide an
example). The most common application was of memory aids (e.g. making a list or keeping
diaries). Others included attentional strategies in tasks such as writing job applications
or following recipes. Three participants said they did not use strategies in real life
situations because they felt that what they had learnt during therapy was not
transferable. One felt they preferred to use their own methods.</p>

qualities of their therapist such as friendliness, politeness, patience or positivity.
Other participants referred to beneficial qualities of the therapeutic relationship, which
was described as trusting, understanding and validating. Most mentioned that the

confidence, reflection or achievement directly after the session. Exceptions were one
participant who said they felt âa bit frustratedâ at times and another who felt
indifferent.</p>
                <p>With regard to the end of the complete course of therapy, responses included (a) relief
that they would have more free time; (b) a sense of achievement that they had completed
the course; and (c) sadness either because they would miss the therapist or the enjoyment
of the tasks. Those who felt sad all said that they were able to deal with this

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>As far as we know, this is the first set of studies to report explicit attempts to gather
and make use of information regarding the acceptability to service users and clinicians in
the development of a CR programme for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. In the first
three studies, CIRCuiTS exceeded high a priori targets for acceptability, comprehensibility
and ease of use, with very high consistency for non-clinical participants from the general
public, patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and CR therapists working within the NHS.
Where occasional targets were not met, or qualitative suggestions for improvements were
made, these were incorporated into the design of the programme through a series of iterative
amendments following high consensus from expert therapists and the research team. The
fourth, qualitative study explored a number of themes of importance to service users, which
not only generally endorsed the acceptability of CIRCuiTS, but may be hypothesis-generating
in future studies investigating factors relating to the process and outcomes of therapy,
such as the importance of the therapeutic relationship (e.g. Huddy, Reeder, Kontis, Stahl
and Wykes, <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For example, one service user
commented that increased behavioural activation had been a positive side-effect of receiving
CIRCuiTS. This might be a fruitful future means of measuring functional changes following
CR.</p>
              <p>In the fourth study, with some consistency, participants reported that (a) they found
receiving the therapy on a computer to be a positive experience, even when they had had
little experience of using a computer; (b) they perceived cognitive improvements as a result
of receiving CIRCuiTS; (c) they had at least attempted to apply CR strategies to everyday
activities (this transfer of new cognitive skills to daily living is an explicit focus of
CIRCuiTS); and (d) the ending of therapy was not a major concern for them. In addition, in
contrast to the findings of Rose et al. (<xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>)
where low self-esteem had appeared to result for those who felt their cognition did not
improve following the therapy, none of the participants in this study reported reduced
levels of self-esteem. Rose and colleagues suggested that a suitable solution for those who
do not notice improvements might be found in changing therapist delivery. Our findings are
consistent with this having happened, as participants reported that their relationship with
the therapist was a significant source of self-esteem, and that therapists helped to create
an environment in which participants felt comfortable. Alternatively, self-esteem may have
been improved as a result of the computer programme, which may now be better at titrating
performance and tailoring tasks to be at a more manageable level for each participant. An
important outstanding question for CR is to what extent the therapist's role is an important
intrinsic non-specific factor that promotes engagement and change. One study demonstrated
that service users who rated the working alliance between themselves and their therapist
more favourably, stayed in CR therapy longer and were more likely to improve on their main
target complaint, but not on working memory performance or self-esteem (Huddy et al., <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). There is also evidence from studies of
internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy that effect sizes are significantly larger when
there is therapist support (see Spek et al., <xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>
for a meta-analysis).</p>
              <p>The studies we report here provide an exemplar of how to use a mixed method approach in
developing therapies with high acceptability to end users. Such studies are rare but can
provide invaluable information relating to the likely future uptake and durability of a
programme. For example, Drake et al. (2013), in a mixed-method study of the feasibility and
acceptability of an online mood-tracking and feedback tool, identified that whilst it
appeared to be a valid measure of mood, a number of key adjustments would need to be made to
ensure participants were sufficiently motivated to use it on an ongoing basis. Such a study
presumably provides a significant short-cut to discovering the feasibility and acceptability
of the programme, without which time-consuming pilot studies may have been conducted that
were likely to be hampered by consumer dissatisfaction. Rigorous acceptability testing may
be particularly important as e-health plays an increasingly important role in the
development of new assessments and interventions in mental health, and the design of these
programmes tends to be led by researchers and clinicians rather than e-learning experts.
Attempts have been made to ensure that internet-based programmes conform to industry quality
standards but these are rare (e.g. Rotondi et al., <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Furthermore, it may not be appropriate to conform to standard design models,
which may have emerged within other areas such as physical health, and thus may need to be
adapted for people with mental health problems (Brunette et al., <xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
              <p>One of the potential pitfalls of gathering service users' views is that outcome measures
are usually designed by clinicians and researchers, who may have a different view to service
users on the most important factors for therapy success. Furthermore, research has shown
that therapy evaluations tend to be biased positively because service users are more likely
to report high rates of satisfaction when they are interviewed by someone with a vested
interest in the therapy (Rose, Wykes, Leese, Bindman and Fleischmann, <xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Whilst these criticisms may be directed at our first three
studies, attempts to minimize the potential for bias were made by: (a) adhering to very
basic questions regarding attractiveness, comprehensibility and ease of use; and (b)
encouraging, all participants to also report bugs or errors in the programme to improve the
design quality, thus priming the expectation that negative criticisms were invited. The fact
that the ratings made by service users, therapist and non-clinical users (who presumably had
very diverse sets of expectations) exceeded targets perhaps argues against the possibility
that poor expectations of service users can lead to heightened satisfaction reports
(Williams, Coyle and Healy, <xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p>
              <p>The fourth study explicitly aimed to address the two pitfalls described relating to service
evaluation as well as adopting qualitative methods to try to elicit full responses. The
participatory method aims to maximize the potential for criticism of the therapy and
minimize coercion of positive views or attitudes towards the therapy with meaningful
measures. Furthermore, this study was kept independent from the feasibility randomized
controlled trial from which the participants were drawn. Despite these factors, feedback
proved to be predominantly positive on all topics covered in the interviews.</p>
              <p>In summary, to maximize the longevity and uptake of psychological therapy programmes
(particularly e-health programmes) within health services, careful testing of the
feasibility and acceptability to service users and clinician users should be undertaken and
the results used to improve therapy designs. Commercially available CR programs should be
evaluated in terms of acceptability and feasibility and whilst this information is largely
neglected, many of these programmes should be considered cautiously. CIRCuiTS is a
computerized CR programme designed for people with psychosis, which is based on a clear
metacognitive theory of the relationship between cognitive and functional change, has an
internal focus on transfer of new cognitive skills to daily life, and is highly flexible in
tailoring to individual patients. It may be unique in demonstrating high acceptability and
ease of use for service users with a schizophrenia diagnosis and clinicians and having been
developed with significant user consultation.</p>
