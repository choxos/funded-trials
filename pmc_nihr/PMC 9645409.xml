                  <p>140 adults (aged ≥18 years) with a prosthetic joint infection of the hip who
required revision (65 randomly assigned to single stage and 75 to two stage
revision).</p>

                  <title>Main outcome measures</title>
                  <p>The primary intention-to-treat outcome was pain, stiffness, and functional
limitations 18 months after randomisation, measured by the Western Ontario and
McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score. Secondary outcomes
included surgical complications and joint infection. The economic evaluation (only
assessed in UK participants) compared quality adjusted life years and costs
between the randomised groups.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The mean age of participants was 71 years (standard deviation 9) and 51 (36%) were
women. WOMAC scores did not differ between groups at 18 months (mean difference
0.13 (95% confidence interval −8.20 to 8.46), P=0.98); however, the single stage
procedure was better at three months (11.53 (3.89 to 19.17), P=0.003), but not
from six months onwards. Intraoperative events occurred in five (8%) participants
in the single stage group and 20 (27%) in the two stage group (P=0.01). At 18
months, nine (14%) participants in the single stage group and eight (11%) in the
two stage group had at least one marker of possible ongoing infection (P=0.62).
From the perspective of healthcare providers and personal social services, single
stage revision was cost effective with an incremental net monetary benefit of
£11 167 (95% confidence interval £638 to £21 696) at a £20 000 per quality
adjusted life years threshold (£1.0; $1.1; €1.4).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>At 18 months, single stage revision compared with two stage revision for
prosthetic joint infection of the hip showed no superiority by patient reported
outcome. Single stage revision had a better outcome at three months, fewer
intraoperative complications, and was cost effective. Patients prefer early
restoration of function, therefore, when deciding treatment, surgeons should
consider patient preferences and the cost effectiveness of single stage
surgery.</p>

              <p>For people with pain and disability caused by osteoarthritis and other hip conditions,
hip replacement can relieve pain and improve function.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the UK in 2019, more than 100 000 primary
hip replacements were performed to treat diseased or damaged joints.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In member countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, nearly 1.7 million primary hip replacements were
done in 2015, an average of 224 per 100 000 population.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For many people, hip replacements can last over 25 years,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> but some people experience complications,
including prosthetic joint infection, which can result in severe pain, disability, or
death.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Reported rates of prosthetic joint infection
within two years of a primary total hip replacement range from 0.8% to 2.1%,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and about 0.6% of people require implant
revision.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the US, the lifetime economic burden of
treatment is estimated to be approximately $390 000 (£360 000; €405 000).<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p>
              <p>Treatment of prosthetic joint infection can be challenging for patients and
surgeons.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Most patients require either a single or two
stage revision involving prosthesis removal, debridement of infected tissue, antibiotic
treatment, and replacement. In a two stage revision, implantation of new prostheses is
delayed for a few weeks to many months, permitting localised antimicrobial strategies
and infection monitoring. Even with a temporary spacer to maintain some function and leg
length, mobility and quality of life are poor between surgeries.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> An alternative single stage revision, in which implant removal,
debridement, and replacement takes place in one operation, is favoured in some
centres.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Although the choice of treatment can be
guided by expert opinion,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> practice has
changed with increased use of single stage revision.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The main treatment priorities of patients receiving revision for
prosthetic joint infection relate to pain, function, and return to normal activities,
rather than infection eradication.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p>
              <p>Reinfection rates have been shown to be similar between single and two stage revision
for treatment of prosthetic joint infection of the hip in large observational
studies,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> however, no randomised clinical trials have
been done. In the INFORM (INFection ORthopaedic Management) randomised controlled trial,
we aimed to determine whether patient reported outcomes are improved 18 months after a
single revision compared with two stage revision. We also aimed to assess the cost
effectiveness of each treatment in terms of quality adjusted life years and costs from a
combined healthcare provider and personal social services perspective, and a wider
societal perspective.</p>

                <p>INFORM was a pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial
comparing effectiveness and cost effectiveness of single stage with two stage
revision to treat prosthetic joint infection of the hip. The protocol and statistical

<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Conduct and reporting followed CONSORT

Ethics Committee South West-Frenchay (31/12/2014;14/SW/1166) and Sweden’s Gothenburg
Regional Ethical Review Board (1190-16.2017-02-16) gave ethical approval. All

                <p>Recruitment was from 1 March 2015 to 19 December 2018. Adults (aged ≥18 years) from
UK and Swedish tertiary referral centres or orthopaedic units were eligible if they
had a prosthetic joint infection of the hip, diagnosed by their treating clinicians,
that required revision. Patients were excluded if they were unwilling to undergo
either intervention, did not have capacity to consent, or were considered unsuitable
for surgery by their treating clinician.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>A concealed, computer generated, 1:1 randomisation list with variable, undisclosed
random block sizes (four or six) stratified by hospital was prepared by an
independent statistician and accessed through an online system maintained by the
clinical trials unit. Randomisation was close to the time of surgery (maximum 12
weeks before) but allowed time for operation planning. Owing to the nature of the
intervention and recovery, surgeons and patients were informed of the allocation
before surgery.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>In a single stage revision, patients underwent prosthesis removal, infected tissue
debridement, and reconstruction with new prostheses under a single anaesthetic
episode. In a two stage revision, patients underwent prosthesis removal, infected
tissue debridement under a single anaesthetic episode with insertion of a
non-articulating or articulating spacer at the surgeons’ discretion. A second stage
procedure under a separate anaesthetic episode was performed after an interval at the
discretion of the treating surgeon, in which any further debridement required was
conducted and a new prostheses inserted. Surgical approach, prostheses, anaesthetics,
and antibiotics were according to the treating clinicians’ usual practice.</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was patient reported pain, stiffness, and function measured by
the internationally validated Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC; range 0–100; 100 is best score),<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> at 18 months after randomisation. Eighteen months was chosen
because almost a full postoperative recovery in pain and function after revision hip
replacement is reported by three months, with a very small additional gain between
three and 12 months.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, in a
large UK cohort, the median time between stages of a two stage revision was 105 days
(interquartile range 70-173).<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Secondary
outcomes included intraoperative events, serious adverse events (defined in
supplementary material methods), WOMAC and its subscales (every three months),
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
(every six months), Brief Pain Inventory<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
(every six months), Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> (every six months), Oxford Hip Score<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> (every six months), 20 metre walk test (at
18 months), and infection status as described in the supplementary material methods
(at 18 months).</p>
                <p>Primary outcome questionnaires were self-completed at the clinic or home visit at
baseline, and by telephone at follow-up. Secondary outcomes were completed at the
clinic or home visit at baseline, and by postal questionnaires at follow-up. A walk
test was also conducted at 18 months in an outpatient hospital clinic. Information on
complications and hospital readmissions were collected from hospital medical
records.</p>
                <p>The economic analysis outcome was the quality adjusted life year<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> at 18 months follow-up, which was calculated using the
EuroQol-5D-5L.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This assessment was
completed at baseline (clinic or home visit), at three months by telephone, and at
months six, 12, and 18 by postal questionnaires. Resources were valued in 2018-19 UK
prices. Methods used to estimate utility values, and measure and value resources are
described in the supplementary material methods and supplementary table 3.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The WOMAC score standard deviation in patients with prosthetic joint infection of the
hip is between 18 and 25.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We calculated that a sample size of 128
participants would provide 80% power to show a 10 point difference in WOMAC score,
equivalent to 0.5 standard deviation, between single and two stage revision. Assuming
a two sided type I error of 5% and 13% attrition,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> we estimated that a sample of 148 participants would need to be
randomly assigned.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Statistical analyses are described in the supplementary material. Statistical and
cost effectiveness analyses were done with Stata/MP version 15.1 (StataCorp). The
study was analysed by intention-to-treat methods. The primary analysis was a two
level linear model regressing the repeated measures of total WOMAC score on
allocation group, time of assessment, their interaction, and adjusted for hospital
and baseline total WOMAC score as fixed effects (measurements nested within patients
modelled as random effects).<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The mean
total WOMAC score at 18 months after randomisation of each allocation group and their
differences were assessed by linear combination of the parameters from this model,
with group differences at other time points estimated from the same model.
Prespecified sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were conducted
(supplementary material methods): adjustment for imbalanced variables at baseline
between randomised groups; a multiple imputation chained equation strategy to account
for participants with missing data; a combined imputation and adjustment analysis;
adjustment to account for operating surgeon modelled as fixed effects; adjustment to
further consider patient and surgical characteristics; tobit analysis to account for
WOMAC score ceiling effect; and an analysis restricted to centres where fewer than
50% of two stage procedures were performed using a custom made articulating spacer
where cemented implants were used as a spacer but loosely fixed to facilitate
revision at second stage surgery if required.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>

                <title>Cost effectiveness analysis</title>
                <p>Cost effectiveness analyses (healthcare provider and personal social services, and
societal perspective) compared the groups that were randomised over 18 months (the
time horizon). Costs and outcomes after one year from randomisation were discounted
at 3.5%.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Resource items were grouped into
categories and summed for each participant, and mean resource use was calculated by
category and trial group. Each item’s cost was calculated by multiplying the resource
use (see supplementary table 25 for resource use categories) by its unit cost and
were summed for each participant. To account for missing data, multiple imputation by
chained equations using predictive mean matching was used (supplementary material
methods). Unadjusted costs associated with healthcare delivered at the treating
hospital (treating hospital perspective) were estimated for three time periods (0 to
6 months; 6 months to 1 year; 12 to 18 months). Unadjusted mean utility values were
calculated by time point and trial group.</p>
                <p>Adjusted mean costs and quality adjusted life years by trial group and differences in
adjusted mean costs and quality adjusted life years over the 18 month period were
estimated using the seemingly unrelated regressions method, which accounts for the
correlation between costs and quality adjusted life years.<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Costs and quality adjusted life years were adjusted for
hospital site, and quality adjusted life years were also adjusted for baseline
utility.</p>
                <p>We calculated the incremental net monetary benefit statistic, representing the value
of the intervention in monetary terms where a willingness-to-pay threshold for a unit
of benefit is known, using seemingly unrelated regression. The UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 was used.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>

                <p>Sample uncertainty within cost effectiveness estimates was investigated exploratory
using cost effectiveness acceptability curves<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> calculated from the seemingly unrelated regression at different
willingness-to-pay per quality adjusted life year thresholds (£0–100 000, in £1000

                <p>As described in the supplementary material methods, sensitivity analyses were
undertaken to account for methodological uncertainty or assumptions made during the

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>In December 2010, February 2011, and September 2011, the planned research was
discussed with the University of Bristol Patient Experience Partnership in Research
(PEP-R) group, comprising nine people with musculoskeletal conditions. Use of
National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) INVOLVE guidance ensured
appropriate organisation of patient and public involvement. With training and support
from research staff and our patient involvement co-ordinator (AB), PEP-R group
members were familiar with research design and conduct. The PEP-R group acknowledged
that although relatively few people develop a prosthetic joint infection, the
research was important and highlighted the need for feasibility work to assess the
acceptability of randomisation to patients and surgeons.</p>
                <p>Within the programme, a dedicated patient forum of five people with experience of
prosthetic joint infection met on 33 occasions between 2014 and 2021 to discuss
issues relating to prosthetic joint infection. Important contributions have related
to the design of patient recruitment and information literature, research processes,
questionnaires, and identification of outcomes of importance to patients. People from
this forum and the PEP-R group will be involved in supporting dissemination
strategies, including the making of a YouTube video for dissemination to a lay
audience. </p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>At 15 high volume tertiary referral centres or orthopaedic units (12 in the UK, three in
Sweden), 1446 patients were screened and 140 patients were randomly assigned to single
stage (n=65) or two stage (n=75) revision (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">fig 1</xref>,
supplementary tables 4 and 5). Most ineligible patients did not have a prosthetic joint
infection (n=506, 35%) or require complete revision (n=629, 43%). The most common
reasons that eligible patients were not randomly assigned (n=46) were patient preference
for single stage revision (n=20, 43%) or patient request for their surgeon to choose the
procedure (n=12, 26%). At 18 months after randomisation, 126 (90%) of 140 patients had
completed a primary outcome and 133 (95%) of 140 patients with at least one
postoperative WOMAC score were included in the main analysis.</p>

              <p>Group baseline characteristics were generally balanced, mean age was 71 years (standard
deviation 9) and 51 (36%) of 140 patients were women; however, patients receiving a
single stage revision were more likely to be male, to be of American Society of
Anesthesiologists classification I or II, and to have previously received non-surgical
management (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, supplementary table 6). No
major differences were reported between groups in the number of organisms cultured,
culture negative infections, organism types, presence of sinus tract, or other
characteristics (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, supplementary table
7).</p>

Sensitivity analyses supported the main primary outcome analysis with: adjustment for
imbalanced variables at baseline; 14 missing assessments imputed; adjustment plus
imputation; adjustment for patient and surgical characteristics; adjustment
accounting for operating surgeon modelled as fixed effects; tobit analysis to account
for WOMAC score ceiling effect; and with centres where fewer than 50% of two stage
procedures were done using a custom made articulating spacer (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>, supplementary table 9 and supplementary fig 2).</p>

                <p>At 18 months, nine (14%) of 65 participants in the single stage group and eight (11%)
of 75 participants in the two stage group (P=0.62) had at least one marker of
possible infection. Four (6%) of 65 participants in the single stage and four (5%) of
75 participants in the two stage group received antibiotics 15-18 months after
randomisation.</p>

                <title>Cost effectiveness analysis</title>
                <p>Data collection of resource use differed in Sweden; therefore, the primary economic
analysis was conducted on 128 participants (n=60 single stage; n=68 two stage)
randomly assigned in UK hospitals (ie, 91% of the total sample). Complete resource
use and costs from treating hospitals were available for 114 (89%) participants,
reducing to 41% from healthcare provider and personal social services and 36% from
societal perspectives due to missing questionnaires. Missing data information for
variables included in the multiple imputation model (n=128) is shown in supplementary
table 24.</p>
                <p>Resources used by the UK cohort over the 18 months varied (supplementary table 25).
Mean theatre time was 76 min longer for patients in the two stage revision group.
This group also spent a longer time in recovery, in high dependency or intensive
treatment units, and in hospital overall, compared with the single stage group. These
participants also had a greater mean number of subsequent inpatient stays, emergency
department attendances, district nurse home visits, nights in residential care homes,
home care visits, took more paid leave, and lost more hours from usual activities.
Patients randomly assigned to a single stage procedure had more primary care nurse
visits, took a greater mean number of hours of unpaid leave, and lost more working
hours in terms of permanently giving up work and reduction in hours worked.</p>
                <p>EuroQol-5D-5L utility values for the UK cohort showed that participants randomly
assigned to the single stage procedure had a gradual improvement from three months
(supplementary table 26). For people assigned to the two stage procedure, the
improvement began at six months. The unadjusted mean costs of all treating hospital
surgical admissions became similar between the trial groups in the last six months of
follow-up (supplementary table 27).</p>
                <p>The total adjusted mean costs for the UK cohort over the 18 month follow-up in the
single stage group were less than in the two stage group from the healthcare provider
and personal social services perspective, £36 256 versus £46 312, a cost difference
of –£10 055 (−£19 568 to −£542; <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>).
This difference reduced slightly from the societal perspective, £51 420 versus
£60 870, a cost difference of −£9450 (−£22 855 to £3956). UK participants in the
single stage group had a greater number of adjusted mean quality adjusted life years
than did those in the two stage group, 0.75 versus 0.69, a difference of 0.06 (−0.07
to 0.18). The incremental net monetary benefit of single stage compared with two
stage was £11 167 (£638 to £21 696) for healthcare provider and personal social
services perspective and £10 589 (−£3855 to £25 033) for societal perspective at
£20 000 per quality adjusted life year threshold.</p>

                <p>In this randomised comparison, single stage revision was not superior to two stage
revision for treatment of prosthetic joint infection of the hip as assessed at 18
months with the patient reported WOMAC score. However, a greater improvement in the
WOMAC scores was noted in the single stage group at three months, implying quicker
recovery, and a lower risk of intraoperative complications, especially fractures.
Single stage revision was also associated with lower costs and higher quality
adjusted life years than two stage revision and hence, was the cost effective option
with the two hospital stays of a two stage revision being the major factor. The
observed quality adjusted life year difference equates to an extra 33 days in best
imaginable health during the 18 months for the single stage group. The greater use of
district nurses and home care workers indicates that the patients in the two stage
group were less able to self-care and leave home after surgery.</p>

                <title>Comparison with previous studies</title>
                <p>In previous case series of people with prosthetic joint infection of the hip,
reinfection rates were similar after single stage and two stage revision at about 8%
or less,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> but data for patient reported outcomes
are very scarce.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A meta-analysis of cohort
studies at the individual patient data level of 1856 patients also found no
difference in re-infections after either strategy, despite a greater proportion of
patients in the single stage group having a previous prosthetic joint infection or
sinus compared with the two stage group.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
Findings were consistent after adjustment for age, sex, previous hip surgery,
comorbidities, and difficult-to-treat organisms.</p>
                <p>Non-randomised studies have suggested that two stage revision is 1.6-1.7 times more
costly than single stage revision.<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> We showed the difference in costs from a
healthcare provider and personal social services perspective to be 1.3 times greater
and from a societal perspective, 1.2 times greater, for two stage compared with
single stage revision. The smaller difference could result from selection bias in
previous studies because surgeons might have performed a two stage revision on
selected patients, for example, those with sinus.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Strengths and limitations of study</title>
                <p>Our study had limitations. The primary outcome was not infection eradication and the
INFORM randomised controlled trial would have had to have been unfeasibly large to
focus on this outcome; but this question might be quantifiable in meta-analysis with
additional trials. However, we used a validated core patient reported outcome measure
to reflect the overall experience of surgery to treat prosthetic joint infection
which our patient forum preferred and is consistent with results of a discrete choice
experiment.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Although further follow up
beyond 18 months might have identified later complications and infections, WOMAC
scores and EuroQol-5D-5L had plateaued and were similar between groups. Furthermore,
randomised groups had similar hospital costs between 12 month and 18 month
follow-ups, and we believe that the care pathway or patient outcomes will unlikely be
different between the two groups beyond the 18 month time point. Diagnostic
guidelines were in existence while the INFORM randomised controlled trial was in
development,<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> with regular substantial changes.<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> We included patients with prosthetic
joint infection diagnosed according to the practice of treating surgeons and
multidisciplinary teams rather than a trial specific definition of prosthetic joint
infection or the diagnostic guidelines, partly because some of the included tests
were not routinely used in the INFORM centres, which reflected contemporary UK and
Swedish practice. Considering the European Bone and Joint Infection Society
criteria,<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> patients included in the
randomised controlled trial were most probably those who had an infection confirmed
rather than infection likely. The preference of some surgeons to insert less well
fixed hip replacement prostheses at the first stage of a two stage revision and
hence, performing a two stage procedure that might never require a second stage,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> added heterogeneity to this group but
reflected the pragmatic nature of the trial. In our sensitivity analysis, primary
outcome results were consistent when accounting for this heterogeneity.</p>
                <p>Missing questionnaire data were a limitation for the cost effectiveness analysis from
personal and societal perspectives; although, because the rate of missing data was
similar between groups, any biases resulting from missing data were unlikely to have
a substantial impact on the results.</p>
                <p>A strength of this pragmatic randomised controlled trial is that patients were not
excluded based on the organisms causing the infection or adverse clinical features,
such as the presence of a sinus tract. This method was consistent with the findings
of the largest observational study to date on the topic, which showed that these
factors had no clear influence on outcome.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
Our trial reports both the final outcome and the patient journey. Qualitative
research has shown how severely this journey affects patients<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and thus, quantifying these differences
is a valuable outcome of this trial.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>The INFORM randomised controlled trial showed that single stage revision is not
superior to two stage revision for treatment of prosthetic joint infection of the
hip, as assessed by the WOMAC measure comprised of pain, function, and stiffness at
18 months. Single stage surgery gives quicker restoration of function and relief of
pain, factors which are of high importance to patients, is associated with fewer
intraoperative complications and is cost effective. We recommend an increased use of
this choice of intervention in appropriate patients.</p>
