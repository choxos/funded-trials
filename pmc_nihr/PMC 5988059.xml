                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The antiplatelet therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (APPLE COPD-ICON2) trial is a prospective 2×2 factorial, double-blinded proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial targeting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at high risk of cardiovascular disease. The primary goal of this trial is to investigate if treatment with antiplatelet therapy will produce the required response in platelet function measured using the Multiplate test in patients with COPD.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Patients with COPD are screened for eligibility using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients are randomised and allocated into one of four groups to receive aspirin plus placebo, ticagrelor plus placebo, aspirin plus ticagrelor or placebo only. Markers of systemic inflammation, platelet reactivity, arterial stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), lung function and quality of life questionnaires are assessed. The primary outcome consists of inhibition (binary response) of aspirin and ADP-induced platelet function at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in inflammatory markers, CIMT, non-invasive measures of vascular stiffness, quality of life using questionnaires (EuroQol–five dimensions–five levels of perceived problems (EQ5D-5L), St. George’s COPD questionnaire) and to record occurrence of repeat hospitalisation, angina, myocardial infarction or death from baseline to 6 months. Safety outcomes will be rates of major and minor bleeding, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity and Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant burden on the National Health Service. It is estimated to affect 3 million people within the UK, with approximately 2 million patients remaining undiagnosed.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> We previously examined the evidence for increased cardiovascular (CV) disease risk in patients with COPD. We have reported possible mechanisms linking these two chronic conditions, discussed possible predictors or markers of poor outcomes among patients diagnosed with both COPD and coronary artery disease (CAD), and the therapeutic options aimed at reducing CV risks associated with COPD.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p>The prevalence of CAD in patients with COPD has been estimated at 10%–38%,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–8</xref> with 20%–50% of mortality in COPD being related to CV causes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> A retrospective database analysis of pooled data from 2007 to 2010 in the USA has revealed a higher prevalence of cerebrovascular and CV disease in patients with COPD compared with subjects with no COPD, with a short-term risk of 35.8% in subjects with COPD compared with 18.9% in control subjects.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) study, Williams <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that coronary artery calcium (CAC) score evaluated on CT scan was higher in patients with COPD than smokers or non-smokers. The presence of CAC is associated with increased dyspnoea, reduced exercise capacity and increased mortality reiterating the fact that the presence of CAD in patients with COPD is associated with poor clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p>
              <p>Beyond the well-known shared risk factors between COPD and CAD (smoking, low socioeconomic status and sedentary lifestyle), several other mechanisms have been thought to contribute to this increased CV risk. Among these are increased platelet activation and aggregation in patients with COPD, as activated platelets play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis. The formation of monocyte-platelet aggregates is a sensitive marker of platelet activation and it takes place in the early stages of the process of development of atherothrombosis.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Patients with COPD have been shown to have an increased level of platelet-monocytes aggregates compared with control subjects, with further increase in the level of these aggregates during an acute exacerbation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p>
              <p>Recently, the Study to Understand Mortality and Morbidity (SUMMIT) trial evaluated whether inhaled treatment with a combined treatment of the corticosteroid, fluticasone furoate and the long-acting β-agonist, vilanterol could improve survival compared with placebo in patients with moderate COPD and heightened CV risk. In this large trial of 16 485 participants, treatment with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol did not affect mortality or CV outcomes. This suggests that treatments targeting inflammation in the lung and attempting to improve lung function do not convey any beneficial effects on overall mortality and CV outcomes. Thus, ongoing clinical research is required to evaluate strategies to improve CV outcomes in this high-risk patients with COPD in whom the CVD burden is very high.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref>
</p>
              <p>Antiplatelet therapy (APT) plays a crucial part in the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Recent reports have shown that inhibition of the purinergic receptor P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> is associated with a marked reduction in platelet reactivity, and has anti-inflammatory effects.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The effects of P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonists beyond platelet inhibition have been previously reviewed in detail.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In an analysis from the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, fewer on-treatment pulmonary adverse events (AEs) occurred in the ticagrelor group compared with the clopidogrel group, with fewer deaths following these AEs, particularly in those who remained on study medication 3 days after AE onset.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Prior data suggest that ticagrelor also influences host defence against bacterial lung infection through adenosine-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated the safe use of ticagrelor in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD with very low rates of bronchospasm.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> There was a similar efficacy benefit and safety profile of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel with low rates of discontinuation of ticagrelor due to dyspnoea.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Importantly, blocking ADP receptors with antagonists protects against cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation and development of emphysema in mice suggesting a potential additional benefit of ADP blockade. A previous observational study showed that the use of aspirin or clopidogrel in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD correlated with a reduction in 1-year mortality (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85, p=0.003).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p>
              <p>These additional effects of P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors offer the potential for primary prevention in a population at high risk for CV disease such as patients with COPD by reducing inflammation with resultant reduction in CV risk. However, our unpublished database review of 24 000 patients with COPD show very few patients with COPD are receiving APT treatment despite the association of increased platelet activity, inflammation and increased CV events in patients with COPD. Although APT using aspirin and ticagrelor (a novel potent antiplatelet agent P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist) is now used in the management of patients with ACS, its role in reducing AEs among patients with COPD at risk of cardiac events without ACS has not been previously evaluated in randomised controlled trials. Therefore, we undertook this proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the effect of APT (aspirin, ticagrelor) on platelet function and explored its effect on the inflammatory markers in patients with COPD with no history of CAD.</p>

                <p>Aspirin is administered as a 75 mg once-daily dose and ticagrelor administered as a 90 mg twice-daily dose for 6 months. The bases for the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) are Brilique (ticagrelor) 90 mg (composition: ticagrelor, mannitol, dibasic calcium phosphate, sodium starch glycolate, hydroxypropyl cellulose and magnesium stearate) and placebo tablets (lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate) supplied by AstraZeneca as well as commercially available aspirin 75 mg tablets (aspirin, maize starch, E553). MODEPHARMA (London, UK) is responsible for arranging the aspirin placebo manufacturing and labelling/randomised packaging of all IMPs and final qualified person (QP) release for clinical trial use. Active and placebo study medication are provided as a 3-month supply. Study medication is prescribed by the principal investigator or the named study clinical research associate according to the protocol, and dispensed to the patient according to local pharmacy policy. Patients in possession of their study medication shall return all trial supplies in their original packaging (even if empty) to the research team at 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits.</p>
                <p>Study drug must be discontinued if, participant develops thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleed, decides they no longer wish to continue or cessation of study drug is recommended by the investigator. The investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study drug in the event of intercurrent illness, AEs, serious AEs, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, protocol violations, administrative reasons or other reasons.</p>
                <p>All patients will be reviewed by the research team at 1 month, 3 months and at 6 months to ensure and enhance the likelihood of good compliance. Compliance with study medication will be assessed by checking and recording the remaining number of capsules after each visit/at the final visit. Study drug accountability will be assessed and documented by local pharmacy. The clinical team will also perform a quick review of any returned study medication at each study visit to identify any obvious compliance concerns and address these immediately with the participant.</p>
                <p>Participants will continue to take medications for other conditions as normal, and a complete listing of all concomitant medication received during the treatment phase are recorded in the electronic case report forms (eCRF).</p>

              <p>The primary outcome for this study consists of inhibition (binary response) ofASPI and ADP-induced platelet function at 6 months. ADP response is defined as ADP &lt;46 and ASPI response is defined as ASPI &lt;40.

In addition, although this study is not powered to measure hard end points, at the time of the start of this study there were not adequate information available in the literature on the CV event rate. Therefore, in addition in our study we recorded the occurrence of repeat hospitalisation, angina, myocardial infarction or death at 6 months. However, we have noted the incidence of CV events described in the more recently published SUMMIT trial, which evaluated the effect of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist on survival in patients with moderate COPD and heightened CV risk.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

                <p>High on-treatment platelet reactivity despite use of P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> antagonists is associated with adverse cardiac events.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A previous study showed that patients with COPD who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention have higher ‘on-treatment’ platelet reactivity compared with patients with no COPD and suggested that this could contribute to the high CV mortality in these patients.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Aspirin inhibits platelet-mediated atherothromboembolic events by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 with subsequent prevention of the synthesis of the potent pro-aggregatory prostanoid thromboxane A2. Despite aspirin therapy, a large number of patients continue to experience atherothromboembolic events, so-called ‘aspirin treatment failure’, and this is multifactorial in aetiology. Approximately 10% do not respond appropriately to aspirin in a phenomenon known as ‘aspirin resistance’.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The beneficial effect of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is modest and occurs at doses of 100 mg or less per day. Older adults seem to achieve a greater relative myocardial infarction benefit.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In the APPLE COPD trial, we evaluate the effect of APT in patients with COPD on platelet function.

                <p>Multiple electrode aggregometry enables rapid assessment of platelet function using a whole blood sample. The signal reaction in multiplate analyser is triggered by the adhesion of activated platelets to the surfaces of the sensor electrodes, which induces an increase of electrical resistance. Each test cell incorporates two pairs of sensors serving as a built-in quality control.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Multiplate analyser, consumables and reagents have been provided by Roche Diagnostics (Roche Diagnostics, West Sussex, London, UK). The multiplate analyser has an electronic pipette and by using a predefined pipette programme, 300 µL of whole blood from a citrate sample is diluted with warm normal saline (0.9%). For each sample, three assays of platelets reactivity are carried out: (1) ASPI test using arachidonic acid to determine the level of inhibition of cyclooxygenase-induced platelet function in accordance with the proposed aspirin effect; (2) ADP test to determine inhibition of ADP-induced platelets aggregation, which is in accordance with the hypothesised ticagrelor effect; (3) the Thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) test to determine platelet reactivity via stimulation of the thrombin receptors is used to ensure the reliability of the results given by the analyser, given patients will not be on any glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists to inhibit platelet reactivity. The results are represented by a graphic curve of aggregation (AU)/min. The parameters of the results are: the velocity (AU/min), the aggregation (AU) and area under the curve expressed in AU×min or U (10 AU×min=1U).</p>

                <title>Vascular stiffness</title>
                <p>Arterial stiffness is another emerging predictor of the risk of CVD. Arterial pulse wave velocity (aPWV) is a widely used method of assessing arterial stiffness. A recently published meta-analysis of 27 longitudinal studies (&gt;20 000 participants) revealed a strong and positive relationship between aPWV and CV morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The severity of emphysema was found to be independently associated with higher arterial stiffness,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> which could possibly be one of the mechanisms of increased risk of CVD in patients with COPD independent of systemic inflammation. Some studies showed aPWV to be higher in patients with COPD but not to be related to the level of inflammatory markers; however, age and blood pressure were found to be determinants of aPWV in these patients.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> We evaluated the baseline vascular stiffness in patients and also repeated these measures at 1 month and 6 months. It is unlikely that APT will lead to significant effect on the vascular stiffness. However given the anti-inflammatory properties of ticagrelor, we wish to explore this further in our study.</p>
                <p>aPWV is measured using Vicorder device (Skidmore Medical), which relies on pressure sensors. This is a non-invasive and reproducible method that can be performed at the bedside using Vicorder software (Skidmore Medical). Participants will be asked to lie on a bed at approximately 45 degrees angle with blood pressure cuffs placed on the arm, upper leg and neck to measure brachial, femoral and carotid artery pressures, respectively. The distance between the sternal notch to the femoral cuff will be used in assessment of aPWV and from sternal notch to umbilicus to assess brachiofemoral pulse wave analysis (PWA). PWA assessment includes measurement of the pulse pressure (PP), augmentation index, which is the difference between the first and second systolic peaks relative to PP and is used as a surrogate measure of arterial stiffness,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and the augmentation pressure in addition to ankle brachial pressure index. PP (systolic minus diastolic blood pressure) can also be used as a surrogate measure of arterial stiffness. A PP wave is generated by each contraction of the left ventricle and it precedes blood flow down the aorta. In normal subjects, the PP wave propagates down the aorta to the peripheral arterioles and capillaries. At the level of the capillaries, part of this wave is transmitted down these small blood vessels and is responsible for the continuous low pulsatile blood flow to the tissues; while part of the wave is reflected back to the left ventricle. The stiffer the arteries and mainly the aorta the faster this reflected wave travels back to the left ventricle causing an increase in the afterload and systolic blood pressure and may result in reduction in the diastolic coronary blood flow.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref>

                <p>Quality of life is impaired in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Improvement in lung function could potentially lead to improvement in quality of life in these patients. Two questionnaires are used to assess the quality of life at baseline, 1 month and 6 months visits. These are the SGRQ-C and the EQ5D-5L. SGRQ-C is the shorter version of the SGRQ, which is a research tool that has been shown to have good discriminative properties and is responsive to therapeutic trials; strong correlation has been demonstrated between SGRQ-C scores and the severity of COPD.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref> The EQ5D-5L Questionnaire assesses the self-reported health status at the time of completion of the questionnaire.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> In the present study, we will be able to evaluate the changes in quality of life in the different treatment groups.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>For each research question, a Fleming A’Hern<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> early phase design is used to investigate the roles of (i) aspirin and (ii) ticagrelor as being individually worthy of further investigation. To determine whether aspirin or ticagrelor is likely to meet a minimum level of efficacy worthy of further investigation, the Fleming A’Hern<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> design requires specification of the response rates at 6 months above and below which would indicate whether to proceed or not proceed to a phase III trial. These rates have been chosen based on a study by Perl <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> who report a response rate for ticagrelor and prasugrel at 1 month of 100% and 91.3%, respectively in a non-randomised comparison. The APPLE COPD trial design assumes a 6-month rate would be high, similar to the reported 1-month rate of Perl <italic>et al.</italic> and as such assumes a response rate to reject either treatment (p0) &lt;65% and a response rate to investigate either treatment further (p1) &gt;80%. The design of the trial focuses on demonstrating that a response rate of 80% is plausible and that the response rate is at least &gt;65%. For each research question, the justification to investigate either treatment further is based on observing a minimum number of responses in each interventional arm, referred to as the critical number. Due to minimal background evidence, the control arms provide a direct and unbiased benchmark. As an early phase trial, the error levels have been inflated beyond those expected for a definitive large phase III study but restricted to an acceptable level for an early phase trial of 12% alpha (type 1) and 12% beta (type 2). With these stated parameters, the target recruitment is calculated as 50 patients per arm for each comparison within the 2×2 design: (i) aspirin (n=50) versus no aspirin (n=50); (ii) ticagrelor (n=50) versus no ticagrelor (n=50), as below. Fifty was the smallest number which satisfies the design criteria above. In this trial, the ‘no aspirin’ and ‘no ticagrelor groups’ provide an unbiased control benchmark response rate due to minimal background evidence. As this trial is investigating outcomes at 6 months following randomisation, the sample size is adjusted for an anticipated 15% dropout rate within the 6-month timeframe, rounded to a target recruitment of 120 patients. The estimated dropout rate will be monitored throughout the recruitment period. The Fleming A’Hern design<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> would indicate no further investigation of each treatment individually if the observed number of responses in each intervention arm (for aspirin and ticagrelor separately) is less than the critical number.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Consenting patients who fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomised using the Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit secure web-based system. Participants are allocated into one of four groups to receive either aspirin plus placebo, ticagrelor plus placebo, aspirin plus ticagrelor or placebo only, using a stratified blocked treatment allocation (permuted random blocks of variable length). The randomisation list was generated by an independent statistician. Stratification is based on the important confounder of age (dichotomised as ≤65 years, &gt;65 years). Each patient is allocated a unique trial number at the point of randomisation. Treatment allocation is double-blinded and as such the randomisation procedure generates a treatment pack number for each participant that links to the corresponding allocated study drug. This automated procedure will produce a pharmacy prescription including the patient’s unique trial number and treatment pack number to ensure the study pharmacist dispenses the correct trial medication.</p>

                <title>Blinding</title>
                <p>Assignment to either active or placebo arm will be blinded to both the participant and investigators/assessor (double-blind). The need for emergency unblinding is felt unlikely and will preferably be avoided. In case of emergency (bleeding), it will be assumed that patient is on dual APT. In the event of bleeding on such medications in routine practice the therapies are simply withheld. No specific therapies are instituted in this setting after initiating simple support measures to reduce bleeding including pressure. In the event of any bleeding deemed clinically significant by the healthcare professional seeing a study participant (either as part of the study team or as part of emergency services), the patient will be advised to provide the patient participation card. This will contain both emergency contact numbers for the study team (to be contacted if deemed needed) and also clear instructions on stopping the trial medications.</p>

                <p>The strategy of reviewing all patients at 1, 3 and 6 months will promote participant retention and complete follow-up. Should a patient withdraw from study drug only, efforts will be made to continue to obtain follow-up data, with the permission of the patient. Data will be entered directly onto a data management system by the research team and stored on the Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit’s MACRO database, provided by Elsevier’s Software as a service system MACRO is a secure validated clinical data management system. Data will be handled, computerised and stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. No participant identifiable data will leave the study site. The quality and retention of study data will be the responsibility of the chief investigator. All study data will be retained in accordance with the latest directive on Good Clinical Practise (GCP) (2005/28/EC) and local policy.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Descriptive statistics will be tabulated by comparative group and overall. Continuous measures will be presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR). As a 2×2 factorial design, the primary analyses are based on a comparison of: aspirin versus no aspirin and ticagrelor versus no ticagrelor. For each analysis, the primary outcome measure is platelet response rate measured at 6 months (1 month response rate is assessed as a secondary outcome measure). Response rate will be calculated on the intention-to-treat (ITT) dataset as the total number of patients responding as a proportion of all patients randomised (patients with missing primary outcome data are classed as non-responders) and reported descriptively as both a rate and unadjusted OR with 95% CIs. A sensitivity analysis will be carried out on the modified ITT dataset. Response rate will be calculated on the modified ITT dataset as the total number of patients responding as a proportion of all patients randomised with a primary outcome measurement at 6 months. Any patients who are not assessable at 6 months will be classed as missing and removed. A sensitivity analysis will be carried out on the per protocol (PP) set where the response rate will be calculated on the PP dataset as the total number of patients responding as a proportion of the number of patients within each comparative group of the PP dataset. Any patients with missing primary outcome data, who are protocol deviators are removed. Secondary analyses will be based on adjusted OR of the treatment effect adjusted by the stratification variables (age) estimated in a multivariable logistic regression model and 1 month reported response rate. AEs will be reported descriptively as the number of events, and number of unique patients experiencing an AE as a proportion of the total number of patients starting treatment. Biological outcome measures will be presented graphically and descriptively as medians (with IQRs). Patient quality of life will be scored according to instructions for the individual questionnaires and reported graphically and descriptively as means (with SD). Due to the randomisation process, platelet reactivity is assumed balanced at randomisation. Previous literature is minimal and as such this trial is designed using early phase methodology with the aim to investigate levels of activity worthy of further investigation in later studies. As such, the trial is not powered for any hypothesis testing.</p>

              <p>This trial is the first study to evaluate APT specifically ticagrelor in patients with COPD with no history of CAD. This study will enable a detailed understanding of the baseline CV disease burden in patients with COPD and the response rate to APT in terms of platelets inhibition. In addition, the effect of APT on inflammatory and CV disease burden is explored. This will help us to very carefully plan future large-scale multicentre primary prevention study among patients with COPD evaluating hard end points such as myocardial infarction and mortality.</p>
