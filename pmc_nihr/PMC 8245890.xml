Participants [14 men (60.9%) and 9 women (39.1%)] were supported in following a vegan diet for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of unrestricted diet. The primary outcomes (plasma TMAO and glucose) were assessed at baseline, during the vegan diet (weeks 1 and 8), and after the unrestricted diet period (week 12). TMAO was assessed after fasting and glucose was measured as a time-averaged total AUC using a 180-minute oral-glucose-tolerance test. Generalized estimating equation models with an exchangeable correlation structure were used to assess changes from baseline, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and weight.ResultsTMAO levels (marginal mean) were reduced after weeks 1 and 8 of a vegan diet compared to baseline, from 10.7 (97.5% CI, 6.61&#x02013;17.3) &#x003bc;mol/L to 5.66 (97.5% CI, 4.56&#x02013;7.02) &#x003bc;mol/L and 6.38 (97.5% CI, 5.25&#x02013;7.74) &#x003bc;mol/L, respectively; however, levels rebounded at week 12 after resumption of an unrestricted diet (17.5 &#x003bc;mol/L; 97.5% CI, 7.98&#x02013;38.4). Postprandial glucose levels (marginal means) were reduced after weeks 1 and 8 compared to baseline, from 8.07 (97.5% CI, 7.24&#x02013;8.90) mmol/L to 7.14 (97.5% CI, 6.30&#x02013;7.98) mmol/L and 7.34 (97.5% CI, 6.63&#x02013;8.04) mmol/L, respectively. Results for glucose and TMAO were independent of weight loss. Improvements in the lipid profile and markers of renal function were observed at week 8.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that a vegan diet is an effective strategy for improving glucose tolerance and reducing plasma TMAO in individuals with dysglycemia or obesity.

                  <p>TMAO levels (marginal mean) were reduced after weeks 1 and 8 of a vegan diet compared to baseline, from 10.7 (97.5% CI, 6.61–17.3) μmol/L to 5.66 (97.5% CI, 4.56–7.02) μmol/L and 6.38 (97.5% CI, 5.25–7.74) μmol/L, respectively; however, levels rebounded at week 12 after resumption of an unrestricted diet (17.5 μmol/L; 97.5% CI, 7.98–38.4). Postprandial glucose levels (marginal means) were reduced after weeks 1 and 8 compared to baseline, from 8.07 (97.5% CI, 7.24–8.90) mmol/L to 7.14 (97.5% CI, 6.30–7.98) mmol/L and 7.34 (97.5% CI, 6.63–8.04) mmol/L, respectively. Results for glucose and TMAO were independent of weight loss. Improvements in the lipid profile and markers of renal function were observed at week 8.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The number of people with diabetes worldwide quadrupled between 1980 and 2014, from 108 to 422 million, 85–90% of whom have type 2 diabetes mellitus (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which accounts for around 10% of global health-care expenditures (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A large portion of this burden is due to managing the elevated prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a major cause of mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Type 2 diabetes prevention and management strategies are routinely focused on weight management, improving glycemic control, and managing CVD risk factors (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p>
              <p>Current dietary guidance for both management and prevention of type 2 diabetes is based on reducing energy and saturated fat intake, and increasing dietary fiber (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Observational evidence has also suggested that plant-based diets are additionally associated with improved lipid profiles, lower prevalences of heart disease, and a reduced risk of cancer, with intervention studies further suggesting that vegan diets may be more efficacious in the management of type 2 diabetes than diets based on current dietary guidance (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>). Coupled with the WHO classification of processed meat as a class 1 carcinogen and red meat as a class 2A carcinogen (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), this has led to growing public interest in the health benefits of plant-based diets. However, there is a lack of consensus across health-care organizations. which in part may be attributed to the lack of intervention studies or elucidated mechanisms linking high levels of meat consumption to poor cardiometabolic health. Higher production of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) with high meat consumption could underlie poor cardiovascular health (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). TMAO is synthesized in the liver from trimethylamine (TMA) through the action of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). TMA is generated by gut microbiota in response to nutrients for which meat and eggs are the major dietary sources, such as choline and carnitine (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Interest in and understanding of the role of TMAO in health and disease has increased over the last decade, with higher TMAO levels consistently associated with an elevated risk of CVD and mortality (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, those with dysglycemia have elevated levels of TMAO, while animal studies have suggested that ingestion of TMAO may promote insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
              <p>Despite the mounting evidence linking TMAO to adverse health outcomes, much less is known about the impact of dietary interventions on circulating TMAO levels. Intervention studies to date have predominately focused on elevations in TMAO after ingesting animal products or choline/carnitine supplements in healthy populations (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>). There has been a lack of research investigating whether eliminating animal products from the diet can reduce TMAO levels along with improving cardiovascular health. Whether eliminating the primary dietary factors known to contribute to the production of TMAO actively leads to a meaningful reduction in circulating TMAO, and the impact of such an intervention in those at risk of cardiometabolic disease, is not known.</p>
              <p>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that eliminating animal products from the diet will result in reduced levels of TMAO and improved glucose tolerance in individuals with obesity or dyglycemia.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>This was a single-center, interventional, single-group, prospective efficacy trial conducted at the Leicester Diabetes Centre, Leicester, UK. The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline, an 8-week vegan diet, and 4 weeks of unrestricted diet resumption. Measurement visits were conducted at baseline (visit 1; week 0), at 1 week after introducing the vegan diet (visit 2; week 1), at completion of the vegan diet (visit 3; week 8), and after 4 weeks of unrestricted diet resumption (visit 4; week 12). Recruitment and study procedures were conducted between October 2017 and January 2019. This study was approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (17/WS/0184). All participants gave written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Recruitment was conducted through primary care, where patient databases were searched for those meeting the following inclusion criteria: aged between 18 and 75 years; either overweight (white participants, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; South Asian/black participants, ≥23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to &lt; 27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥5.7% and ≤8% (39–64 mmol/mol) identified within the last 36 months or obese (white participants, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; South Asian/black participants, ≥ 27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); not taking any form of glucose-lowering medication currently or within the last 60 days; no current or recent (within 6 months) oral antibiotic or steroid use; nonsmoker; and no ongoing CVD. In addition, participants self-reporting as vegan, vegetarian, or occasional meat eaters (&lt;3 portions of meat/fish per week) were excluded.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>After eligibility was confirmed and baseline assessments were completed, each participant had a 90-minute consultation with a research dietitian during which weekly menu plans and shopping lists were developed and personalized to the participants’ diet, personal preferences, and habitual energy intake. Information about the range of vegan products commonly available from popular supermarkets was provided, along with education on how to read and interpret food labels for the inclusion of animal products. Participants visited the center on 2 separate occasions during the intervention (week 1 and week 8 of the vegan diet). In addition, the research dietician provided individualized follow-on telephone support between face-to-face visits on a 10–14-day basis. After the end of the 8-week vegan diet, participants were asked to resume their normal, unrestricted diet. Participants were asked to continue their preexisting medication regimens throughout.</p>
                <p>Portion sizes, energy intake, and the macronutrient content of the diet were unrestricted. A research dietician made unannounced telephone calls to each participant to administer a 24-hour diet recall. These recalls were not statistically analyzed, but allowed the investigators to check compliance rates and provide additional dietary counseling as needed. In addition, a 3-day dietary record was completed by each participant at baseline and at weeks 1, 8, and 12, with each record including 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. For statistical purposes, nonadherence to the study protocol was defined according to the following criteria: <italic>1</italic>) 2 or more portions of meat, poultry, fish, or egg reported during 24-hour recalls; or <italic>2</italic>) if one-third or more of captured compliance scales (from 0, “non-compliant,” to 10, “fully compliant”) list a score of 5 or less.</p>

                <title>Primary Outcomes</title>
                <p>We defined 2 primary outcomes a priori: glucose tolerance in an oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) and fasting plasma TMAO.</p>
                <sec id="sec2-4-1">
                  <title>Oral-glucose-tolerance test</title>
                  <p>The participants were requested to consume a vegan meal the evening before their baseline visit and then consume the same meal before subsequent visits to standardize the OGTT test. All participants were required to fast ≥10 hours prior to the OGTT (drinking water was allowed). Participants were asked to avoid general exercise and drinking alcohol, coffee, and caffeinated tea in the 48 hours before each OGTT. The OGTT involved collecting fasted blood samples and then ingesting 75 g of anhydrous glucose (300 ml Rapilose) with further blood samples collected at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Glucose was analyzed on the day of collection by the University Hospitals of Leicester pathology department using the Hexokinase method via an automated analyzer (ADVIA XPT clinical chemistry analyzer, Siemens Healthineers). Plasma was collected by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10 minutes and stored in −80°C freezers. Insulin was analyzed from these plasma samples collectively at the end of the trial using Magnetic Luminex Assays (R&amp;D Systems). Each sample was run in duplicate to ensure reliability of readings, and duplicate sample values with ≥20% variability were reanalyzed. OGTT data were used to derive the total AUC (tAUC) using the trapezoidal rule; tAUC values for insulin and glucose were then time averaged, as has been reported previously (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Resulting values represent the mean glucose and insulin concentrations during the OGTT; values are therefore referred to as the average postprandial response.</p>

                  <p>Fasted blood samples collected during the OGTT were also used for the assessment of plasma TMAO levels. A sample analysis was conducted in duplicate using stable isotope dilution [D9-TMAO (98.0% purity)], followed by an ultra‐performance LC–tandem MS analysis. This was performed on a Shimadzu Nexera X2 LC-30AD coupled with a Shimadzu 8050 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan), using optimized conditions of a previously described method, which produced a CV of 3.6% (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Information on current smoking status, family history of type 2 diabetes, medication status, and ethnicity was obtained after an interview-administered questionnaire with a health-care professional. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements (mm Hg) were taken after participants had rested in a seated position for 5 minutes, using a digital monitor and a standard cuff maintained at the level of the heart. Three measurements were taken at 2-minutes intervals; the first measurement was disregarded, and the mean of the last 2 was used for analysis.</p>
                  <p>Body weight (Tanita TBE 611; Tanita) and height (Leicester Height Scale) were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.5 cm, respectively. The subsequent values were used to compute BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Waist circumference was measured over light clothing between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest and recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm.</p>
                  <p>Body composition was assessed using DXA (GE Lunar iDXA Series model) by a fully qualified technician. Each participant's body composition was measured at 2 visits (baseline and week 8). A DXA scan was used to assess each participant's body fat mass and fat-free mass, as well as body composition within segments.</p>
                  <p>Serum total cholesterol (esterase and cholesterol oxidase conversion, followed by a Trinder end point), HDL cholesterol (Trinder reaction following elimination of chylomicrons), triglycerides (GPO-Trinder), urea (urease enzymatic method), and creatinine (Jaffe reaction) were measured by individuals blinded to the participants within routine clinical laboratories at the University Hospitals of Leicester laboratories via an automated analyzer (ADVIA XPT clinical chemistry analyzer, Siemens Healthineers). HbA1c was analyzed using the HPLC method on a Tosoh G11 analyzer (Tosoh Corp., Shiba). Centrifuged plasma samples stored in −80°C freezers were analyzed for C-reactive protein using Magnetic Luminex Assays (R&amp;D Systems). LDL cholesterol was calculated as: total cholesterol − (triglyceride/2.2) – HDL cholesterol. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the modification of diet in a renal disease study equation: 186 × (creatinine/88.4) − 1.154 × (age) − 0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.210 if black) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).

                  <p>A 20% reduction in glucose tAUC was anticipated as a conservative estimate for the intervention effect based on previous dietary interventions (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Therefore, given that the SD for glucose tAUC values has previously been found to represent 27% of the mean in those at high risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), resulting in a standardized difference of 0.74, and assuming a significance of 0.025 (allowing for 2 primary outcomes), a power of 80%, and an intra-individual correlation of 0.5 across repeated measures, a total of 20 participants were required.</p>

                  <title>Analysis</title>
                  <p>This analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 24.0). In order to investigate the effect of an 8-week vegan diet on postprandial glucose and TMAO levels compared to baseline, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used. GEE models were built with an exchangeable correlation structure to allow for analyses of repeated measurements at baseline, 1 week, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. Postprandial glucose was analyzed using a normal distribution with an identity link, whereas TMAO displayed a skewed distribution and was therefore analyzed assuming a gamma distribution with an identity link. In order to investigate the extent to which changes in the primary outcomes are influenced by changes to body weight or lifestyle factors, 2 models were developed: Model 1 remained unadjusted for covariates, while Model 2 was adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and weight as repeated (time-varying) covariates. Significant main effects for the models were explored through post hoc tests comparing each follow-up to baseline. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using the same approach. A Pearson correlation matrix was used to investigate the correlation between the change in TMAO and change in postprandial glucose at each time point. We considered 2-tailed <italic>P</italic> values of 0.025 or less statistically significant for main effects to allow for the inclusion of 2 primary outcomes. Results are presented as means (97.5% CIs), unless stated otherwise.</p>

In addition, no servings of meat were recorded during the food diary data collection in week 1 (visit 2) or week 8 (visit 3). The removal of meat from the diet resulted in a significant reduction to protein and saturated fat intakes during weeks 1 and 8, with fiber intake increased during week 1 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

              <p>In this interventional, single-group, prospective trial, plasma TMAO levels were reduced and glucose tolerance improved after 1 week of a vegan diet in omnivores with dysglycemia or obesity, and both outcomes remained improved after 8 weeks of the intervention. The effect of a vegan diet on glucose was independent of the effect on TMAO and visa versa, suggesting the results for 1 were independent of the other. The dietary intervention also elicited a reduction in total cholesterol and improvements in markers of kidney function. To our knowledge, this is the first interventional study to investigate the impact of a vegan diet on TMAO levels in adults at risk of cardiometabolic disease.</p>
              <p>Plant-based diets (including vegan diets) have been seen to provide nutritional advantages compared with omnivorous diets, with benefits for cardiovascular health, blood pressure and plasma lipids (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This study further demonstrates that a vegan diet substantially improves glucose tolerance whilst providing the novel finding that levels of TMAO are also reduced. These results confirm the research hypothesis, which was supported by clinical data indicating that regular consumption of meat is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and increased levels of TMAO (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This intervention study also supports a previous, larger observational study showing that those that adhered to a vegan diet had substantially lower TMAO levels (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Changes observed after 1 week of the vegan diet are also in line with existing evidence confirming that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to an altered diet (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
              <p>Whilst weight loss was not encouraged in this intervention, a mean weight loss of 2.6 kg was observed after the 8-week vegan diet. However, the effect of the vegan diet on TMAO and glucose tolerance was not affected when adjusting for weight at baseline and follow-up. Furthermore, changes in both glucose tolerance and TMAO levels were already evident at 1 week, despite greater weight loss occurring after 8 weeks. These results are in keeping with known mechanisms for the production of TMAO, which are related to the ingestion of specific nutrients, such as choline and carnitine, or to consumption of fish (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) rather than energy intake per se. The results for glucose tolerance are also supported by known mechanisms. For instance, vegan diets appear to increase the intake of protective nutrients, such as fiber (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). An increased intake of dietary fiber, predominately soluble fiber, has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Indeed, a number of studies have shown that nonviscous dietary fiber intake in the form of resistant starch may improve glycemic control by delaying gastric emptying, thus reducing the rate of glucose absorption and decreasing the rate of glucose uptake (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, a previous study in those with type 2 diabetes suggested that although a vegan diet resulted in improved glycemic control over the longer-term in comparison to a standard diet (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), the benefit did not appear to be fully independent of weight loss. Therefore, the full extent to which the health benefits of a vegan diet are dependent on, or independent of, weight loss requires further research.</p>
              <p>Importantly, this research study suggests that the effects of a vegan diet on improved glucose tolerance were independent of the reduction in TMAO, which could indicate that the reduction in TMAO precipitated by a vegan diet is not directly involved in promoting improved glucose tolerance. This is in contrast with some evidence in laboratory animal models and humans that TMAO may affect the glucose metabolism (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, it is consistent with other studies which found no link between TMAO and markers of cardiometabolic health (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This also reflects the wider literature, where the role of TMAO as a causal marker of cardio-metabolic disease in humans is debated (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), despite the wealth of mounting animal and observational research supporting causal mechanisms or associations (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Taken together, whilst this study suggestions a vegan diet acts to substantially reduce TMAO levels, the therapeutic importance of this reduction to improving cardiometabolic health has not been fully established and requires further research.</p>
              <p>The effects of the vegan diet on the primary outcomes were supported by secondary outcomes, where a reduction in total cholesterol and improvements in markers of renal function were also demonstrated. An improved lipid profile has consistently been reported following a vegan diet (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, the finding that a vegan diet may also improve markers of renal function is novel and of potential clinical importance. Chronic kidney disease is associated with dysglycemia and is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). There is emerging observational evidence that plant-based diets are associated with a reduced risk of chronic kidney disease and with better renal functioning (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), as proposed mechanisms related to plant-based diets are lower in sulfur-containing amino acids and phosphate (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In addition, the same animal proteins that are related to the formation of TMAO, namely choline and carnitine, are also thought to increase the production of uremic toxins, which are renally eliminated and may cause impaired renal function (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This study adds to this emerging observational evidence by suggesting that in adults at risk of cardiometabolic disease, eliminating meat from the diet results in improved renal function in the absence of chronic kidney disease. This finding therefore supports the need for further intervention research into the efficacy and effectiveness of plant-based diets in the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease.</p>
              <p>This study has several strengths. It provides novel evidence in a high-risk cohort, which adds to the evidence around the potential efficacy of a vegan diet in type 2 diabetes and CVD prevention. Secondly, this is the first study, to our knowledge, demonstrating that a vegan diet markedly reduces levels of TMAO. Moreover, the dietary compliance rates were high throughout the intervention, further supporting the feasibility of a vegan diet intervention among this population. In fact, the acceptability of a vegan diet in clinical studies is found to be analogous to that of moderately low-fat diet (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Nevertheless, there are some important limitations. While this study provides an initial proof of concept using an interventional before and after design, the absence of a control group means causality cannot be confirmed, and results may have been caused by co-occurring changes to other health behaviors. It is also possible that the marked reductions to saturated fat intake and increased fiber intake or the modest changes to body weight observed in this study would have provided metabolic benefits independent of a vegan diet. However, adjustment for these changes did not affect the study findings.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this is the first study to show that an 8-week vegan diet can elicit decreases in plasma TMAO levels when compared to baseline in individuals at risk of cardiometabolic disease, whilst also contributing to mounting experimental research showing that vegan diets lead to markedly improved glucose tolerance, independent of weight reduction. This study should be used to inform future type 2 diabetes and CVD prevention and management interventions and trials. In particular, the longer-term clinical relevance of reducing TMAO levels needs to be elucidated.</p>
