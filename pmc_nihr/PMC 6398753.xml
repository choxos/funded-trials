                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a severe manifestation of ulcerative colitis (UC) that warrants hospitalisation. Despite significant advances in therapeutic options for UC and in the medical management of steroid-refractory ASUC, the initial treatment paradigm has not changed since 1955 and is based on the use of intravenous corticosteroids. This treatment is successful in approximately 50% of patients but failure of this and subsequent medical therapy still occurs, with colectomy rates of up to 40% reported. The <underline>I</underline>nterleukin 1 (IL-1) blockade in <underline>A</underline>cute <underline>S</underline>evere C<underline>o</underline>litis (IASO) trial aims to investigate whether antagonism of IL-1 signalling using anakinra in addition to intravenous corticosteroid treatment can improve outcomes in patients with ASUC.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>IASO is a phase II, multicentre, two-arm (parallel group), randomised (1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of short-duration anakinra in ASUC. Its primary outcome will be the incidence of medical (eg, infliximab/ciclosporin) or surgical rescue therapy (colectomy) within 10 days following the commencement of intravenous corticosteroid therapy. Secondary outcomes will include disease activity, time to clinical response, time to rescue therapy, colectomy incidence by day 98 post intravenous corticosteroids and safety. The trial aims to recruit 214 patients across 20 sites in the UK.</p>

                  <p>The trial has received approval from the Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 17/EE/0347), the Health Research Authority (Ref: 201505) and Clinical Trials Authorisation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. We plan to present trial findings at scientific conferences and publish in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition of the colon associated with diarrhoea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. UC affects around 120 000 people in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> UC tends to follow a relapsing/remitting course with periods of comparative health interspersed with unpredictable acute ‘flares’. These may be severe enough to mandate hospital admission. For patients with UC in the UK, annual hospitalisation rates with acute severe UC (ASUC) are around 3% (3600 individuals). Twenty to forty per cent of these patients will require emergency surgical removal of the colon (colectomy) during the same hospital admission.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> A recent UK audit of emergency surgery in colitis showed mortality rates of 4% at 90 days.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Additionally, surgery carries significant morbidity associated with the need for at least a temporary stoma, as well as long-term complications (both physical (eg, adhesional disease) and psychological) and complications of subsequent procedures (eg, pelvic nerve damage with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis or completion proctectomy).</p>
                <p>Treatment for ASUC involves high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and is standardised worldwide.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> After 3–5 days, patients who do not exhibit an improvement may be considered for medical ‘rescue’ therapy with further immunosuppression using either infliximab or ciclosporin. Those patients who subsequently fail to respond to medical treatment, or patients with fulminant colitis at presentation, will then proceed to surgery, typically within the space of 4–10 days of rescue therapy initiation. This is usually performed on the same admission with a subtotal colectomy and creation of an end ileostomy.</p>
                <p>The initial management of ASUC has changed little since the seminal trial of intravenous corticosteroids in 1955.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Despite significant advances in therapeutic options and drug development for ambulatory patients with UC, patients with ASUC are typically excluded from the eligibility criteria of standard clinical trials for patients with moderate to severe UC. Clinical trials that have compared infliximab or ciclosporin as medical rescue treatments for ASUC have required patients to fail to respond to treatment with up to 5 days of intravenous steroids.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> In the absence of reliable early prognostic markers, it may be appealing to treat all patients presenting with ASUC with immunosuppressive treatments normally reserved for rescue therapy rather than corticosteroids alone. The barriers for this approach include the toxicity of such treatment<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref> as well as the financial burden incurred.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> There is still therefore an unmet need to improve the management of ASUC by doing something at the point of initial treatment, rather than waiting for treatment failure.</p>
                <p>One of the key mediators of colonic inflammation in ASUC is interleukin 1 (IL-1) which plays a pivotal role in local activation of neutrophils and a number of downstream inflammatory mediators.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The IL-1 axis has been repeatedly identified as a therapeutic target in UC.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> IL-1 antagonism occurs naturally via the ubiquitous IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). A recombinant form of this naturally occurring anti-inflammatory, anakinra (Kineret), has been used for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) with good effect.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref> Anakinra has a very good safety profile in many disease states including RA, CAPS, severe sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage at standard subcutaneous dosing regimens and using high-dose intravenous administration regimens.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 23 24</xref>
</p>
                <p>Our hypothesis is that antagonism of the IL-1 axis with anakinra is an effective way of abrogating the early inflammatory response seen in ASUC and leads to improved clinical outcomes.</p>
                <p>There is evidence to suggest that anakinra cotreatment with corticosteroids may be beneficial, given that corticosteroids suppress the production of IL-1Ra to a greater extent than its active family members—IL-1α and IL-1β.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Moreover, while recent research has seen a trend towards antagonism of IL-1 using monoclonal antibodies,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> anakinra may offer some advantages. First, its relative short half-life (4–6 hours) compared with antibodies allows early institution of further immunosuppression therapy if rescue therapy is required. Second, anakinra antagonises both IL-1α and IL-1β, while monoclonal antibodies are specific to either form. Finally, given that the patent for anakinra is now expired, the cost of the product is much less than that of the monoclonal antibody alternatives.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> Given this evidence, antagonism of IL-1 early in the course of inflammation, in conjunction with standard corticosteroid treatment, is a promising therapeutic avenue in patients with ASUC.</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p>The Interleukin 1 blockade in Acute Severe Colitis (IASO) trial aims to test whether anakinra can reduce the need for medical or surgical rescue therapy in patients with ASUC when given alongside intravenous corticosteroids. The trial also aims to assess the effects of anakinra on disease biology and bowel inflammation in addition to assessing drug safety, longer term health and patient-reported quality of life outcomes. Finally, the trial will seek to advance scientific understanding of ASUC through the collection and analysis of a large range of biological samples, including blood and tissue transcriptomic analysis, as well as microbial analysis. As part of this work, we will attempt to validate a transcriptional predictor of outcomes in UC that we have previously reported.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

                <p>Participants’ involvement in the trial will last approximately 6 months. This includes an initial treatment period of approximately 5–7 days, during which screening and an investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment course of up to 5 days will be completed. Review of participant outcomes following trial participation may continue for up to 5 years using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, without any additional burden to the participant. Any HES data collection would start at 1 year after commencement of IMP treatment and examination of outcomes via HES data would potentially continue for up to 5 years, depending on study outcomes. A yearly assessment of HES outcomes by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) would determine whether collection of HES data should continue.</p>

                  <p>We plan to include approximately 214 participants (107 per group) in the trial with 40 participants also included in the optional endoscopic substudy. Recruitment of 214 patients to the main trial will give 85% power to detect a 20% absolute risk reduction (ARR) in the primary endpoint from a rate in the control group of 49% testing at the 5% significance level.</p>
                  <p>We have based our estimate of the primary endpoint rate on data from the recently completed National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded CONSTRUCT trial.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> This trial recruited 270 patients with ASUC across 52 UK sites between 2010 and 2013. In CONSTRUCT, 49% of patients admitted with ASUC needed escalation to medical rescue therapy following treatment with corticosteroids (Professor J Williams, personal communication). Since there are no existing estimates of effect size for anakinra in ASUC, we chose to power IASO to detect a 20% ARR following protocol review by members of the British Society of Gastroenterology IBD Clinical Research Group, who advised that this was the minimum effect size needed that would make a substantial difference to the patient population, and which would be broadly in line with effect sizes seen in other drugs for moderate to severe colitis.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41–43</xref>

                <title>Implications of pragmatic trial design</title>
                <p>In designing the Interleukin 1 blockade in Acute Severe Colitis (IASO) trial, we have followed a ‘pragmatic’ approach to trial design. This aims to test our intervention under conditions as close to real-life routine practice as possible and so produce results that can be generalised and applied in routine practice settings. Another important aspect to consider was that, since the intervention targets an early molecule in the inflammatory cascade, and since there are already well-established options for rescue therapy, we wanted to test the intervention as close as possible to the point of recognition of a patient by a treating physician as having acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). If the intervention is shown to have a positive outcome, then the generalisation of the trial findings might include consideration of initiation of anakinra dosing at the same time as intravenous corticosteroids, that is, as part of initial therapy.</p>
                <p>For these reasons, we aimed to keep our inclusion criteria as broad as possible and minimise exclusion criteria. Thus, in essence, almost any patient with ASUC capable of giving informed consent can participate in IASO. The key criterion is the recognition of ASUC by a physician and the judgement that intravenous corticosteroids are needed. The use of the modified Truelove and Witts severity index (MTWSI) serves as a ‘sense-check’ on this physician judgement to ensure that patients with too low a burden of inflammation or symptoms are not included. We considered and rejected other inclusion criteria that might be typically seen in ‘explanatory’ trials in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as the use of video endoscopy with local or centralised scoring, or faecal calprotectin measurement. Although local assessment of the mucosa is widely used in the assessment of patients with ASUC, in many centres intravenous corticosteroids may be started before this point. Furthermore, the use of centralised scoring would introduce delays into participant screening to the extent that randomisation and dosing would be impossible to achieve prior to the point where rescue therapy should be considered. The use of physician judgement as the main arbiter for inclusion does risk the inclusion of patients who subsequently turn out to have, for example, Crohn’s colitis or even infectious colitis, just as does happen in real life with decisions around corticosteroid initiation. We can, of course, obtain endoscopic data as well as clinical and histological data where available and these are indeed built into our analysis plans. But ultimately, IASO seeks to address whether a physician encountering a patient who he or she believes to have ASUC, on the basis of the evidence available, can and should prescribe anakinra in addition to corticosteroids. In this regard, more detailed inclusion criteria would not produce a generalisable result, while jeopardising timely patient identification and trial recruitment.</p>
