                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>New-onset hypertension affects approximately 10% of pregnancies and is associated with a significant increase in risk of cardiovascular disease in later life, with blood pressure measured 6 weeks postpartum predictive of blood pressure 5–10 years later. A pilot trial has demonstrated that improved blood pressure control, achevied via self-management during the puerperium, was associated with lower blood pressure 3-4 years postpartum. Physician Optimised Post-partum Hypertension Treatment (POP-HT) will formally evaluate whether improved blood pressure control in the puerperium results in lower blood pressure at 6 months post partum, and improvements in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular phenotypes.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>POP-HT is an open-label, parallel arm, randomised controlled trial involving 200 women aged 18 years or over, with a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension, and requiring antihypertensive medication at discharge. Women are recruited by open recruitment and direct invitation around time of delivery and randomised 1:1 to, either an intervention comprising physician-optimised self-management of postpartum blood pressure or, usual care. Women in the intervention group upload blood pressure readings to a ‘smartphone’ app that provides algorithm-driven individualised medication-titration. Medication changes are approved by physicians, who review blood pressure readings remotely. Women in the control arm follow assessment and medication adjustment by their usual healthcare team. The primary outcome is 24-hour average ambulatory diastolic blood pressure at 6–9 months post partum. Secondary outcomes include: additional blood pressure parameters at baseline, week 1 and week 6; multimodal cardiovascular assessments (CMR and echocardiography); parameters derived from multiorgan MRI including brain and kidneys; peripheral macrovascular and microvascular measures; angiogenic profile measures taken from blood samples and levels of endothelial circulating and cellular biomarkers; and objective physical activity monitoring and exercise assessment. An additional 20 women will be recruited after a normotensive pregnancy as a comparator group for endothelial cellular biomarkers.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy affect 10% of pregnancies, which equates to &gt;80 000 women per year in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> One study showed that 50% of women with pre-eclampsia have persistent significant hypertension on day five following delivery,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> with blood pressure (BP) control remaining an issue for up to 6 weeks after childbirth, often requiring multiple medications and careful titration. At the same time, competing demands on mothers, not least from her newborn baby, are associated with poor adherence and/or poor levels of clinical contact. Drug titration can, therefore, be sporadic exacerbating poorly controlled hypertension. The risk of poor BP control during this period may extend into later life. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with a twofold increase in risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> with a third presenting with chronic hypertension within 10 years.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> We observed that high BP during the first 6 weeks post partum is related to the risk of higher BP in the 5–10 years following a hypertensive pregnancy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore, the Self-management of Postnatal Anti-hypertensive Treatment (SNAP-HT) randomised controlled pilot study<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> showed BP control in the post-partum period can be improved through self-management, with a mean improvement of 5.2 mm Hg in systolic and 6 mm Hg in diastolic BP at 6 weeks post partum. However, the most striking finding was that mean diastolic BP remained 4.5 mm Hg lower in the intervention group at 6 months’ post partum; even after all but two mothers had stopped medication. Long-term follow-up of the women involved in the trial demonstrated diastolic BP remained significantly lower in the intervention group (−6.8 mm Hg), at more than 3 years post partum, even when adjusted for ‘lifestyle risk factors’.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In those below the age of 50 years diastolic BP is also a better correlate to long-term cardiovascular risk and is the predominant pathophysiology in young adults<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> before progression to the mixed and systolic patterns of hypertension seen in those over 50.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Given all our patients are young females, below the age of 50 years, 24 hours overall average diastolic BP was selected as the primary outcome for our trial.</p>
              <p>In the general population, high BP is strongly related to long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and is the leading risk factor for loss of disability-adjusted life-years in high-income and low-middle-income countries. Every 10 systolic/5 diastolic mm Hg of BP reduction associates with a ~40% reduction in lifetime stroke risk and ~20% reduction in coronary heart disease risk.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> If the difference observed in SNAP-HT could be translated to all women who have a hypertensive pregnancy, significant reductions in disease burden could be achieved in the population. However, several questions remain to determine the potential clinical translational benefits of self-management of BP in the postpartum period. First, can a similar reduction in BP be achieved with updated technology in a trial powered to detect diastolic BP differences at 6 months? Bluetooth-enabled home BP monitors allow for automated upload of readings to the app, reducing the need for manual entry during a busy period in the patients’ lives. This also facilitates telemonitoring by physicians who can review and advise on readings.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> Second, does improved postpartum BP control also result in reduced end organ damage in the cardiac, vascular and cerebrovascular systems? Hypertensive pregnancies are associated with early changes in cardiac, vascular and brain structure and function, which are disproportionate to their cardiovascular risk profile.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> This may explain why this population have an increased risk of later cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. It is possible these changes may emerge during pregnancy and persist long term, independent of postpartum BP variability, although the significant cardiovascular adaptations that emerge during pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are known to reverse to some extent during the postpartum period<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref>. An alternative hypothesis it that the long-term risk reflects a failure of the cardiac, vascular or cerebral systems to ‘normalise’ after pregnancy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> If so, improved postpartum BP control may offer a new approach to modify these long-term end-organ changes, in addition to any beneficial effects on BP.</p>

              <title>Hypotheses</title>
              <p>The primary hypothesis is that BP self-management with clinician oversight will reduce diastolic BP at 6–9 months post partum; in women requiring antihypertensive medication in the puerperium after a hypertensive pregnancy.</p>
              <p>The secondary hypotheses are that BP lowering in the puerperium and strict control within predefined target ranges during this time period will improve cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular and vascular phenotypes in this cohort including:</p>

              <p>In addition, it is hypothesised the intervention will lead to improvements in peripheral vascular function, including integrity of the retinal vasculature and markers of vascular stiffness. The tertiary hypotheses are that self-management will be associated with higher quality of life scores once discharged from hospital, fewer postnatal readmissions to hospital, improved endothelial function; and fewer signs of kidney injury and fibroinflammation.</p>

                <p>Physician Optimised Post-partum Hypertension Treatment (POP-HT) is a single-centre, open-label, two-arm parallel, randomised controlled trial in women who develop hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, who require antihypertensive treatment at the time of discharge. This study will investigate the effectiveness of postpartum physician assisted self-management of BP compared with standard care over the first 6 months post partum.</p>
                <p>We will recruit 200 participants, who will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 fashion to either the intervention or control arm. The intervention arm will comprise app-based home BP monitoring (including periods of home 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) coupled with physician-assisted self-management. The control arm will receive ‘standard’ levels of National Health Service (NHS) care from their GP and midwives and health visitors. All participants will be recruited from the Oxford Women’s Centre at the John Radcliffe Hospital, which sees approximately 25 patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy per month.

                <p>The purpose of the sub study of 20 women is to provide a reference population of women not affected by hypertensive disease. In the sub study, 20 healthy postnatal women will undergo measurements of specific characteristics of blood cells and circulating factors involved in inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. This small subcohort population will validate how blood cells and circulating factors vary naturally and may be affected by external factors such as mode of delivery and BP. These 20 normotensive participants will be compared with 20/200 participants who have had a hypertensive pregnancy and that are in the main study. These 20/200 will provide additional consent for blood sampling for endothelial cells at baseline and at the V4 visit. The 20 normotensive patients will be recruited from the postnatal ward in the Oxford Women’s Centre and the normotensive participants will be recruited directly to the substudy and, not be expected to participate in the main POP-HT study (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix C</xref> for a schedule of procedures for the substudy).</p>

Therefore, those women allocated to the control arm, who are unable to obtain a monitor from the Oxford Women’s centre/NHS service, will be provided with a validated BP home-monitoring device by the trial team to ensure they can adhere to this RCOG guidance during week one. These monitors will be provided to enable the control arm participants to monitor their own BP and in turn liaise with their own GP/mid-wife to adjust their management based on their readings. The study team will not be offering remote management to the control arm or providing them with an app, interpretation of the readings and management decisions are to be taken by their own GPs/clinicians. These monitors will also be used to allow remote BP measurements during the study visits at weeks 1 and 6.</p>

                  <p><bold>Primary outcome measure</bold>: <bold>24-hour average diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) at 6–9 months post partum as assessed by SPACELAB 90217 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitor</bold></p>
                  <p>Sample size calculation: The detection of BP differences between the two arms of this trial is based on the mean diastolic blood pressure difference detected in the pilot SNAP-HT study at 6 months. The mean BP difference detected between the intervention and control arm at the 6-month time point was −4.5 mm Hg.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> We have used a more conservative SD of 10 mm Hg in each arm (in SNAP-HT the SD was 8.2 mm Hg in the intervention arm and 9.8 mm Hg in the standard care arm) and a 10 mm Hg SD is in keeping with pooled SDs for ambulatory diastolic blood pressure readings from other studies. To detect a treatment effect on diastolic blood pressure of −4.5 mm Hg, powered to 80% at p=0.05 requires a total sample size of 158 and with 1:1 randomisation this would require 79 in each arm (total sample size of 158). During COVID-19 a Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology guideline<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> was issued that recommended a home BP monitor be given to all women for the first week(s) after discharge. As a result of the potential dilution that self-monitoring in the control group could have, we recalculated our sample size. One systematic review<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> concluded self-monitoring in the control arm could lead to a potential 0.42 mm Hg dilution of the impact of self-management on diastolic BP, when measured using 24 hours ABPM. Therefore, assuming the same SDs of 10 mm Hg in each arm as in our original power calculation, we subtracted 0.42 mm Hg from the 4.5 mm Hg between group difference we had originally powered on. To remain powered at &gt;80% and we would require 95 in each group (190 total) and hence we planned to over-recruit to 220 (rather than the original 200) to allow for this.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p><bold>(1) Cardiac structure</bold>: Studies using echocardiography by our collaborators have compared BP and LV mass in pre-eclampsia patients and control patients, at 1-year post partum.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> They found that a difference in BP at 1 year of 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP corresponded to significant differences in LV mass. SNAP-HT appeared to achieve a 50% reduction of anticipated BP difference seen between pre-eclamptic and normotensives at 1 year year by 6 months, that is, ~5 mm Hg. If it is assumed that the structural/phenotypic benefit results from the BP benefit, as we are hypothesising, then we must power to detect 50% of the phenotypic difference. In previous work by our group[45], we have demonstrated significant differences in LV mass/EDV (g/mL) in a similar age and predominantly female population with similar mean diastolic BP differences between groups to that seen in SNAP-HT. The LV mass/EDV (g/mL) in the group with high normal blood pressure was 1.54g/ml g/mL vs 1.22 g/ml g/mL in those with optimal blood pressure with a standard deviationSD of 0.33 and 0.27, respectively, at p&lt;0.001. Based on these assumptions, to observe a treatment effect of 0.16 (50% of the difference between 1.54 g/mL and 1.22 g/mL) on LV mass/EDV, requires 67 in the intervention arm and 67 in the control arm (132 total). This is calculated using the larger SD of 0.33 referenced above at a power of &gt;80% to detect a difference between the groups at p=0.05. This number should take into account for the greater drop-out rate we may see for the MRI outcomes.</p>
                  <p><bold>(2) Brain white matter integrity:</bold> Work by our group[14], on pre-eclamptic pregnancy, showed an increased burden of temporal lobe white matter lesion volume 5–10 years after a pre-eclamptic pregnancy (23.2±13 µL) vs matched individuals who had a normotensive pregnancy (10.9±11.5 µL) at p&lt;0.05. If we again assume we can detect a 50% of the phenotypic benefit with our intervention as outlined above, we would anticipate a 50% reduction in the burden of white matter lesions, that is, 6.15 μL (50% of 23.2–10.9 μL) in the intervention arm. With 71 in the intervention group and 71 in the control group (142 total), this will provide &gt;80% power at p=0.05, even using the more conservative SD of 13 μL to detect a 50% improvement in white matter lesion volume between the intervention and the control group. This number should take into account for the greater dropout rate we may see for the MRI outcomes.</p>
                  <p>
                    <bold>(3) Aortic compliance</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several studies assessing the impact of blood pressure on aortic compliance have shown that even modest reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure increase aortic distensibility/compliance. One such study had a mean difference in systolic blood pressure of 4.6 mm Hg between the two drug treatment arms at 52 weeks, akin to the same mean difference in SNAP-HT at 6 months, and other studies have suggested diastolic BP may be even more important in influencing aortic compliance. In this study with a mean 4.6 mm Hg difference in systolic BP there was a treatment difference of 0.12 (95% CI −0.35 to 0.60), p=0.60 in aortic compliance. Based on these assumptions, to observe a treatment effect from our intervention, with 100 in the intervention and 100 in the control arm we will be more than powered at &gt;90% to detect a difference at p=0.05 in POP-HT. In this study, we will assess both aortic stiffness (by Vicorder PWV and AI) and aortic compliance by MRI although power calculation here is based on MRI measures of aortic compliance.</p>

                    <bold>Exercise ejection fraction</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within our group, Huckstep <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> compared resting and exercise ejection fractions for young adults with high normal BP versus a normotensive cohort.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The cohort was well-matched demographically to our planned study cohort, although it included both males and females. Resting ejection fraction (by Biplane Simpson’s) was similar between groups but at 40%–60% of peak exercise intensity, the higher blood pressure group had a lower exercise ejection fraction than the normotensive cohort (73.9±3.25 vs 80.0%±4.54%, p&lt;0.001) and in keeping with this, a smaller increase in ejection fraction when going from baseline to 40% exercise intensity (10.4±5.92 vs 19.0%±6.90%, p&lt;0.001). Assuming the ~5 mm Hg mean BP improvement achieved in SNAP-HT again translates to a 50% phenotypic benefit, when assessing exercise ejection fraction we anticipate a 4.3% improvement in exercise stress ejection fraction in the intervention arm vs the control arm (4.3% is 50% of the difference, ie, 50% of 10.4%–19%). With 43 participants in the intervention arm and 43 in the control arm (86 total), we will be powered at &gt;80% to detect such a difference at p=0.05. This calculation also takes account of the lower number likely to undertake the cardiopulmonary exercise testing at the final study visit.</p>

                  <p>The analysis will be carried out on the basis of intention-to-treat (ITT). This is, after randomisation, participants will be analysed according to their allocated intervention group irrespective of what treatment they actually receive. Patient demographic characteristics and other baseline information will be summarised by treatment group. Numbers (with percentages) for binary and categorical variables and mean (SD), or median (IQR or full range) for continuous variables will be presented.</p>
                  <p>A linear mixed model will be applied to compare the groups with respect to the primary outcome. The model will include baseline bedside (ie, clinic) diastolic BP (mean of the second and third bedside diastolic BPs, randomised group and minimisation factors (gestational age at the time of presentation with pre-eclampsia/gestational hypertension (continuous) and prescription of ACE inhibitor at randomisation) as fixed effects. Participant will be included as a random effect. For all participants included in the primary outcome analysis, the mean 24 hours average diastolic BP will be reported by randomised group. Adjusted mean differences between randomised groups with 95% CI and p value will be estimated from the model for the following comparison: self-management (intervention) versus usual care (control) at a single time point (V4: the final study visit).</p>
                  <p>Secondary BP outcomes will be analysed using the same method. Other secondary outcomes will be analysed using analysis of covariance to establish a covariant model to examine the effect of BP control in the postpartum period on cardiac structure and function, vascular function and cerebrovascular structure and function. If the model assumptions are not met and evidence of departure from normality is observed, transformations of the data will be employed or non-parametric tests will be carried out. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, SE, range, etc) will also be calculated for each outcome for each group. Differences in the secondary outcomes will be compared between intervention and control groups.</p>
                  <p>Mean changes in BPs will be compared across the population and correlated with cardiovascular endpoints including cardiac structure and function reported from cardiac MRI and echocardiogram. Demographic and physiological characteristics of the participants will be added to regression models as covariates to explore the determinants of change in BP comparing intervention and control groups.</p>

                <p>A serious adverse event (SAE) occurring to a participant will be reported to the REC that gave a favourable opinion of the study where in the opinion of the Chief Investigator the event was ‘related’ (resulted from administration of any of the research procedures) and ‘unexpected’ in relation to those procedures. Reports of related and unexpected SAEs should be submitted within 15 working days of the Chief Investigator becoming aware of the event, using the HRA report of SAE form (see HRA website). The severity of events will be assessed on the following scale: 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe.</p>
                <p>Non-serious AEs considered related to the trial intervention as judged by a medically qualified investigator or the sponsor will be followed up once the event is considered stable. It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgement to decide whether or not an AE is of sufficient severity to require the participant’s removal from the trial. A participant may also voluntarily withdraw from the trial due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE. If either of these occurs, the participant must undergo an end of trial assessment and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms cease, or the condition becomes stable.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Until recently, key evidence missing from trials of self-monitoring/telemonitoring was whether it actually led to lower BP. In 2018, the TASMIN-H4 randomised trial<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> showed that GPs using self-monitored BP to titrate antihypertensives, with or without telemonitoring, achieved better BP control for patients using telemonitoring. As with previous trials, the mechanism of action appeared to be medication optimisation. More recent work shows that patient and clinician experience was largely positive and cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that self-monitoring in this context is cost-effective by NICE criteria.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Self-monitoring can be combined with self-titration of medication, a process known as self-management. The SNAP-HT trial<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> demonstrated that self-management postpartum following a hypertensive pregnancy offers great promise. The purpose of the POP-HT trial is to assess whether this BP reduction can be reproduced in a larger, PROBE study (Prospective Randomized Open, Blinded End-point) powered to detect differences in BP as the primary outcome.</p>
              <p>Our group have studied women 10 years after hypertensive and normotensive pregnancies to characterise their cardiovascular, vascular and cerebrovascular systems. Consistent with previous reports,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19 40</xref> women who had been through hypertensive pregnancy were more likely to have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), increased LV mass and impaired diastolic function. In addition, cerebrovascular changes were evident including; lower grey matter volumes, and greater white matter lesion density compared with the control population.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 41</xref> Vascular phenotypic changes included reduced capillary density and increased aortic stiffness.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 42</xref> These phenotypic differences were not explained by differences in traditional cardiovascular risk factors at the time of assessment. It is possible such differences emerge during pregnancy and persist independent of postpartum BP variability but this is not really known<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and, although the cardiovascular adaptations that emerge during hypertensive pregnancies reverse to some extent postpartum,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref> an alternative hypothesis is that long-term ‘risk’ reflects a failure of the cardiac, vascular or cerebral systems to ‘normalise’ after pregnancy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22 43 44</xref> The POP-HTtrial aims to determine if these phenotypic changes emerge as early as 6–9 months and if so, whether they can be mitigated by postpartum BP optimisation. If so, this may offer one approach to modify long-term end organ changes,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> in addition to any beneficial effects on BP that are demonstrated in this trial.</p>
