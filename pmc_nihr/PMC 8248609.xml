                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Frailty is associated with adverse health outcomes in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Evidence supporting targeted interventions is needed. This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to inform the design of a definitive RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a home-based exercise intervention for pre-frail and frail older adults with CKD.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants were recruited from nephrology outpatient clinics to this two-arm parallel group mixed-methods pilot RCT. Inclusion criteria were: ≥65 years old; CKD G3b-5; and Clinical Frailty Scale score ≥4. Participants categorised as pre-frail or frail using the Frailty Phenotype were randomised to a 12-week progressive multi-component home-based exercise programme or usual care. Primary outcome measures included eligibility, recruitment, adherence, outcome measure completion and participant attrition rate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants to explore trial and intervention acceptability.</p>

                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Six hundred and sixty-five patients had an eligibility assessment with 217 (33%; 95% CI 29, 36) eligible. Thirty-five (16%; 95% CI 12, 22) participants were recruited. Six were categorised as robust and withdrawn prior to randomisation. Fifteen participants were randomised to exercise and 14 to usual care. Eleven (73%; 95% CI 45, 91) participants completed ≥2 exercise sessions/week. Retained participants completed all outcome measures (n = 21; 100%; 95% CI 81, 100). Eight (28%; 95% CI 13, 47) participants were withdrawn. Fifteen participated in interviews. Decision to participate/withdraw was influenced by perceived risk of exercise worsening symptoms. Participant perceived benefits included improved fitness, balance, strength, well-being, energy levels and confidence.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This pilot RCT demonstrates that progression to definitive RCT is possible provided recruitment and retention challenges are addressed. It has also provided preliminary evidence that home-based exercise may be beneficial for people living with frailty and CKD.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to a disproportionate decline in health status when exposed to an insult, such as infection or trauma [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Frailty is highly prevalent in chronic conditions, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], within which underlying pathological processes contribute to the development and advancement of the frailty syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Importantly, frailty and its precursor pre-frailty are associated with adverse health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Within CKD populations, frailty is associated with worse health-related quality (HRQOL) [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], falls [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], hospitalisation [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Validated frailty screening and assessment tools are available [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and are increasingly used in clinical practice. However, evidence supporting targeted interventions for people living with pre-frailty/frailty is still needed [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Physical inactivity and associated poor physical function are common in CKD and worsen with disease progression [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Both are components of physical frailty [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and are individually associated with adverse health outcomes in CKD, including mortality [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Ramer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that maintaining independence was an essential health outcome priority for older people living with CKD. Maintenance of or increasing to a regular frequency of physical activity can lead to improvement in physical frailty in older adults [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Greenwood et al. [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] demonstrated that a renal rehabilitation programme can improve physical function and is also associated with longer event-free survival in patients with CKD. Increasing physical activity levels, therefore, may lead to improved physical function and, in turn, maintenance of independence and improved survival rates in people living with frailty and CKD. However, additional high quality trials are needed [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that include people living with frailty, individuals that are often poorly represented in interventional studies [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Home-based exercise programmes may be more effective in people living with frailty, as they allow practice in a familiar functionally-relevant environment. Furthermore, the benefits may be sustained in the longer term, as they are implemented without the need for direct supervision, empowering patients to incorporate exercise within their daily lives. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of exercise, including home-based exercise, in people with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease demonstrated improvements in physical and walking capacity [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the authors acknowledged that the generalisability of findings is “limited by age” as the “approximate mean age of participates in the included trials ranged from 50 to 65 years” [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Studies in older frail non-CKD populations suggest that home-based exercise interventions are feasible and may be associated with improved outcomes, in terms of frailty, functional performance, nutritional status and falls incidence [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, research is needed to evaluate home-based exercise interventions tailored to the needs of older people living with frailty and CKD [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>The aim of the EX-FRAIL CKD Trial, a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), is to inform the design of a definitive RCT that evaluates the effectiveness of a home-based exercise intervention in pre-frail and frail older adults with CKD by: (1) evaluating the rate of eligibility, recruitment, intervention adherence, outcome measure completion and attrition; (2) qualitatively exploring the acceptability of the randomisation procedure, outcome measures and, in the intervention arm, of the progressive home-based exercise programme; and (3) estimate the standard deviation of walking speed in pre-frail/frail people with CKD to inform the sample size calculation for a definitive RCT. A pilot RCT was needed to address key uncertainties prior to definitive evaluation of the intervention to maximise the success of a large-scale RCT.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>The EX-FRAIL CKD trial is a two-arm parallel group pilot RCT. Participants were allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to 12-weeks of home-based exercise or usual care. Outcome assessments were performed at baseline and 12-weeks’ post-randomisation. Final assessments were delayed for some participants (specifically those who temporarily had the intervention held due to an adverse event) to allow participants the opportunity to complete a total of 12-weeks of home-based exercise. Participants were invited to participate in a nested qualitative study following 12-week assessments or following a participant’s decision to discontinue the exercise programme.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited from Department of Renal Medicine outpatient clinics at the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (LTHTR). Inclusion criteria were: age ≥65 years old; CKD G3b-5 (not receiving dialysis or received a kidney transplant); and with a Clinical Frailty Scale score ≥4 [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Clinical Frailty Scale is a simple screening measure that has been validated in people with advanced CKD at risk of frailty [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Exclusion criteria were: unstable angina or recent (within the last 3 months) myocardial infarction; uncontrolled arrhythmias; persistent uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mmHg); recent (within the last 3 months) stroke or transient ischaemic attack; registered blind; unable to mobilise independently; receiving palliative care for advanced terminal cancer; recently (within the last 12 months) enrolled in a structured exercise programme (e.g. cardiac rehabilitation) prescribed by a health professional; anticipated to commence dialysis or receive a renal transplant within the next 3 months; insufficient understanding of the English language to complete study questionnaires or follow advice within the exercise programme guidebook; and clinical and/or research team consider participation in the exercise programme unsafe. Following written informed consent, participants underwent an objective frailty assessment, using the Frailty Phenotype (FP), to ensure that only patients with pre-frailty or frailty were randomised.</p>

Briefly, exercise group participants received a physiotherapist-led exercise education session, an exercise guidebook and weekly telephone-calls from the research team. The multi-component exercise programme comprised a combination of strength, aerobic and balance exercises [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There were six exercises within the programme, with each having four different levels of difficulty. Participants categorised as frail were advised to perform level one exercises initially, whereas pre-frail participants could start with level two exercises. Exercise progression was discussed during weekly telephone calls with aim of maintaining a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) score of 12–16 (i.e. moderate intensity) for exercises 2–6 [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

                <title>Interviews</title>
                <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted, using a predetermined topic guide, with a purposively selected group of participants from both study arms, considering age, sex and frailty status. Interviews explored the acceptability of the randomisation procedure, outcome measures and, in the intervention arm, of the progressive home-based exercise programme. The Chief Investigator (ACN), a Specialist Trainee in Renal Medicine, conducted all interviews. ACN received training from an experienced qualitative researcher (KWF). During interviews ACN was cognisant of the potential for personal bias, given his prior association with participants and the subject area. Interviews and transcripts were regularly discussed and reviewed with KWF for potential bias concerns. Further detail on the interviews has been published previously [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Data analyses</title>
                <p>Quantitative outcome measures are reported descriptively with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on normally distributed data relating to secondary outcome variables to descriptively present the mean difference (and associated standard deviation) between groups whilst adjusting for baseline measurements. Barthel Index score data were not normally distributed and are therefore presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Data relating to frailty status, a categorical variable, are presented as frequencies and percentages. SPSS Statistics (version 25.0.0.1, IBM Corp) and R (version 4.0.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing) statistical software were used to conduct statistical analyses. The intervention effect size (Cohen’s d) was calculated and used to inform the sample size calculations for a future trial. G*Power (version 3.1.9.4) was used to perform the sample size calculations [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis; narrative segments were coded and then collated into potential themes, which were iteratively reviewed to develop a ‘thematic map’ [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. NVivo software (version 12.6.0, QSR International) was used to support qualitative analysis. Qualitative and quantitative findings were linked [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and presented in a ‘joint display’ [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>

                <p>The trial opened in August 2018; data collection was completed in December 2019. <xref rid="pone.0251652.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> demonstrates the participant flow throughout the study. Six hundred and sixty-five patients had an eligibility assessment with 217 (33%; 95% CI 29, 36) eligible for enrolment. Four hundred and forty-eight (67%; 95% CI 64, 71) patients were considered ineligible. Reasons for ineligibility are detailed in <xref rid="pone.0251652.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. One hundred and fifty-three (23%; 95% CI 20, 26) patients declined participation. Most patients did not offer a reason for declining participation (n = 79; 52%; 95% CI 43, 60). Reported reasons for declining participation are detailed in <xref rid="pone.0251652.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>. The research team were unable to contact 28 (4%; 95% CI 3, 6) patients to complete the eligibility assessment and were unable to accommodate a baseline study visit for 1 (0.46%; 95% CI 0.02, 2.94) eligible patient prior to recruitment closure. A total of 35 (16%; 95% CI 12, 22) participants were recruited to the study. Six (17%; 95% CI 7, 34) were categorised as robust using the FP assessment and were withdrawn prior to randomisation. Fifteen participants were randomised to the exercise group and 14 to the usual care group.</p>

                <p>A median of 28 (IQR 16) exercise sessions were completed during the 12-week intervention period. Eleven (73%; 95% CI 45, 91) exercise group participants completed ≥2 exercise sessions per week, with a mean of 36.5±8.5 minutes spent exercising each session. The mean RPE score for exercises 2–6 was 12±2. The main reasons for missing exercise sessions were pain (n = 14; 56%; 95% CI 35, 75), participant wishes (n = 7; 28%; 95% CI 13, 50) and feeling unwell (n = 4; 16%; 95% CI 5, 37).</p>
                <p>Retained usual care and exercise group participants completed all outcome measures (n = 21; 100%; 95% CI 81, 100). Eight (28%; 95% CI 13, 47) participants were withdrawn from the study. Two (14%; 95% CI 3, 44) participants were withdrawn from the usual care group; the research team learned issues following randomisation that meant participation in an exercise programme was considered unsafe. Six (40%; 95% CI 17, 67) participants were withdrawn from the exercise group: musculoskeletal pain (n = 3; all made a complete recovery), prescribed specific exercise by a physiotherapist during the trial period (n = 1) and participant wishes (n = 2).</p>

                <p>Many participants’ decision to take part in the study was motivated by a sense of altruism, whereas others were motivated by the potential for personal gain. Participants’ decision-making was also influenced by family members and trusted healthcare professionals. Although many were indifferent about the randomisation process, some had definite preferences and were disappointed with the outcome of randomisation. Some participants acknowledged that they felt frail and were not deterred by the word ‘frail’. One participant did not identify as being frail by their understanding of the term. Overall, participants understood the rationale for the outcome assessments and accepted their inclusion within the study visits. One participant reported frustration with the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), specifically with regards to the number of questions asked and the time taken to complete the PROMs. They did not highlight any one PROM being more problematic than another.</p>
                <p>Some participants expressed fear, particularly fear of pain, at the thought of participating in exercise or being more physically active. Several participants highlighted the importance of positive staff attitude when delivering exercise education and supporting participant engagement with exercise. Participants found the concept of RPE unfamiliar. Only one participant remained dismissive of recording RPE scores. A variety of factors influenced participants’ motivation to exercise including: personal goals; self-determination and resilience; personal responsibility to participate after study consent; a sense of achievement following exercise session completion; telephone calls with the research team; exercise location; exercise enjoyment (or lack thereof); and perceived ineffectiveness of exercise. Participants reported liking exercising at home, citing convenience, flexibility and privacy as being positive aspects of the exercise programme. Several participants described the benefits that they experienced, including: improved fitness, balance and strength. Participants also described improvements in their well-being, energy levels and confidence. Finally, involvement in the study promoted self-reflection, in terms of personal levels of physical activity and functional ability, which motivated participants to be more active.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first trial involving a home-based exercise programme for pre-frail and frail older adults with CKD. Progression criteria thresholds were exceeded for eligibility, adherence and outcome measure completion. However, recruitment and loss to follow-up progression criteria thresholds were not achieved. The use of a mixed-methods approach provided a comprehensive evaluation of study procedures and the intervention, highlighting potential areas requiring adaptation.</p>
              <p>Although, the use of the word ‘frail’ did not deter participants from taking part in our study, the term can be viewed negatively [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The inclusion of this in the study materials may have deterred some patients from discussing study involvement. Rather than avoid this terminology, study materials could provide a more detailed explanation of the language of frailty. Participants described concerns about their ability to participate in exercise due to perceived mobility issues or because of concerns about exercise eliciting or exacerbating pain. These findings highlight the importance of early face-to-face discussions between potential participants and informed healthcare professionals to address these concerns. There were also mixed feelings about the randomisation process with some participants having a preferred study arm. Adoption of a delayed-start trial design would hopefully dispel these reservations, though would necessitate a longer study period [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
              <p>There is an anticipated attrition rate with any study, not least studies involving an older, frail and multimorbid population [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Studies of home exercise interventions for older adults living with frailty have reported retention rates ranging from 53–98% [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study, decision to withdraw appeared to be influenced by perceived ineffectiveness and a fear of worsening symptom experience with physical activity. These findings have been reported previously in patients with CKD [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A previous study that evaluated 12 weeks of supervised exercise demonstrated an improvement in symptom-burden for people with CKD [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. There was an increase in the frequency of ‘joint/bone pain’ with the intervention that included resistance training; however, this was not statistically significant [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Importantly, the intervention resulted in a reduction of ‘loss of muscular strength/power’ symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and an objective improvement in muscle mass and strength [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further education about the potential benefits of exercise on symptom experience should be provided to participants from the outset, whilst acknowledging that it is not uncommon to experience transient discomfort when increasing physical activity levels.</p>
              <p>With a home-based exercise intervention, participants require the appropriate knowledge, skills and confidence to actively engage with the intervention, otherwise known as patient activation [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Low patient activation levels are described in older patients living with frailty [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and older patients living with advanced CKD [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Additional efforts to improve patient activation, specifically tailored to the individual participant [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], may promote participant retention. Considering the theory of planned behaviour, positive enhancement of an individual’s perceived behavioural control, i.e. the “perception of the ease or difficulty of performing the behaviour of interest”, is beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, self-determination theory suggests intrinsic motivation is an important factor for behaviour change; therefore encouraging participant autonomy may improve participant retention [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although confidence intervals were expectedly wide, exercise group participants had a 0.5 (95% CI -0.9, -1.8) score increase in SPPB- an acknowledged meaningful score change [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Notably, there was also an improvement in POS-S RENAL score (-1.4; 95% CI -6.6, 3.7), though again confidence intervals were wide. Participants reported experiencing benefits related to exercise, including improved fitness, balance, strength, well-being, energy levels and confidence. Although this study was not powered to investigate the effectiveness of the home-based exercise programme, these findings suggests that the intervention may offer benefits to people living with frailty and CKD.</p>
              <p>A sample size of 1542 participants would be needed for a definitive RCT that used walking speed as the primary outcome measure. Even before accounting for participant attrition, this is clearly an unrealistic target. A more realistic sample size of 268 and 200 participants would be needed if using the SPPB or POS-S Renal, respectively. Physical function and symptom-burden are clinical outcomes relevant and important for people living with CKD and people living with frailty alike [<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0251652.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that either may be used as the primary outcome measure of interest in a RCT investigating the effectiveness of a home-based exercise programme in this patient population.</p>
              <p>Notwithstanding this pilot RCT’s strengths, there are acknowledged limitations. Recruited participants were all White British and the feasibility of a RCT in other populations cannot be presumed. For pragmatic reasons, patients that declined enrolment in the main study were not offered the opportunity to participate in the qualitative study. Therefore, reasons for non-enrolment can only be reported descriptively based upon patient comments. Most participants enrolled in the study were categorised as pre-frail by the FP. It is possible that patients living with frailty, particularly more severe frailty, have greater concerns about participating in exercise, either due to lack of confidence or burden of frailty and co-morbidity. There is therefore a risk that the suggested trial adaptations do not adequately address this potential recruitment issue. Exercise adherence was measured using exercise diaries and weekly telephone calls, which are subject to recall bias. However, this was considered the most realistic approach as using an accelerometer would: (1) not distinguish between exercise and other activity; and (2) introduce an additional parameter that may influence behaviour change, i.e. participants using the accelerometer may be more motivated to exercise. Participants involved in the qualitative study were interviewed by a researcher also involved in the delivery of the intervention. However, participants were informed that the purpose of the interview was to understand their experience of the study to identify areas for improvement for a definitive RCT. Finally, blinding of outcome assessors should be considered for a RCT investigating the effectiveness of the intervention.</p>
              <p>In summary, the EX-FRAIL CKD trial demonstrates that progression to a large-scale definitive RCT is possible provided recruitment and retention challenges are addressed. Furthermore, it has determined the necessary sample size for a RCT using clinically relevant and important primary outcome measures for the study population. Finally, it has provided preliminary evidence that home-based exercise may be beneficial for people living with frailty and CKD.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Nixon,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. Both reviewers agree that it provides a clear and well presented account of your trial, but they highlight a few minor points of concern.  After careful consideration, therefore, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. We invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Feb 06 2021 11:59PM.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to inform the design of a definitive RCT evaluating the effectiveness of home-based exercise intervention in older adults with chronic kidney disease. Primary outcome measures included eligibility, recruitment, adherence, outcome measure completion, and attrition rate. Fifteen participants were randomized to intervention and 14 to usual care. Participant perceived benefits in the areas of fitness, balance, strength, well-being, energy levels and confidence. The study identified challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>
              <p>Minor revisions:</p>
              <p>1- Line 247: Indicate the statistical method(s) used to estimate the 95% confidence intervals.</p>
              <p>2- Line 344: The power calculations should include: (1) the estimated outcomes in each group; (2) the α (type I) error level; (3) the statistical power (or the β (type II) error level); (4) the target sample size and (5) for continuous outcomes, the standard deviation of the measurements.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Nixon et al. reported a pilot RCT regarding home-based exercise for frail elderly patients with advanced CKD. The study is very well structured and performed, and the manuscript is well written. Also, it is a very important and relevant area of research to explore the efficacy and effectiveness of very practical and applicable way of long-term exercise such as home-based exercise in those with CKD. However, current version of manuscript is still immature to be published as it appears.</p>
              <p>* Although the outcomes are various, several studies of home-based exercise in CKD were already reported elsewhere (Eidemak et al. Nephron 1997, Tang et al. Int J Nurs Pract. 2017, Hiraki et al. Clin Exp Nephrol 2017, Aoike et al. Clin Exp Nephrol 2018, all of which were cited in recent metanalysis paper ; Nakamura et al. Sci Rep 2020) and all of those should be cited and compared to current study in terms of methods/durations/intensities of the exercise, adherence to and completion rate of the protocols, and the outcomes.</p>
              <p>* One of the major limitations of this study is that exercise was only measured subjectively (diaries and phone calls). This should be also noted and discussed as a major limitation of the study.</p>
              <p>* Intensity of the exercise seems relatively weak for those with almost normal Barthel Index. Authors should also discuss about this, which might affected the judgement of effect of the exercise.</p>
              <p>* In Table 3, all the data are presented as mean +- SD, however, I wonder if all data were distributed normally or not.</p>

              <p>Dear Editorial Board,</p>
              <p>We thank the Editors and Reviewers for taking the time to consider our manuscript ‘Home-based exercise for people living with frailty and chronic kidney disease: a mixed-methods pilot randomised controlled trial’ for publication as a clinical trial in PLOS One. Thank you also for the extension to the time usually permitted for a response. We endeavour to respond to the Academic Editor’s and Reviewers’ points comprehensively below.</p>
              <p>Academic Editor</p>
              <p>1. We have now formatted the manuscript to meet PLOS ONE’s style requirements.</p>
              <p>2. We have provided additional information about the eligibility criteria and about the intervention.</p>
              <p>3. We have provided additional information on qualitative methodology.</p>
              <p>4. We have updated our Competing Interests section.</p>
              <p>5. An abstract of preliminary results was presented at an ERA-EDTA conference and the abstract was published in a NDT supplementary issue, associated with the ERA-EDTA conference. The manuscript under consideration for publication in PLOS ONE, however, contains the full details of the study and updated results that have not been published previously. </p>
              <p>6. The minimal anonymized data set necessary to replicate study findings is now available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3ffbg79hp" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3ffbg79hp</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 1</p>
              <p>1. We are uncertain as to what is meant by the statistical methods used to calculate the 95% confidence intervals. All 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the described statistical software, e.g. 95% confidence intervals of proportions using R (version 4.0.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing). We would be happy to revise again if the Reviewer could provide further detail on this point.</p>
              <p>2. Thank you for this comment. We have updated the section titled ‘Sample Size Estimation’ to improve clarity. </p>
              <p>Reviewer 2</p>
              <p>1. Thank you for highlighting these papers. We have amended the Introduction to acknowledge the systematic review and meta-analysis, which includes all the mentioned papers. </p>
              <p>2. Thank you for highlighting this. We acknowledge that exercise diaries and telephone calls are subject to recall bias, though do not entirely agree that the use of exercise diaries and telephone calls is a major limitation of the study. We have amended the limitations section of the Discussion to address this point. </p>
              <p>3. Although participants had a high Barthel Index score, they were assessed as pre-frail or frail using the Frailty Phenotype. There is overlap between disability and frailty, but an individual can be frail without having disability; frailty itself can affect ability to participate in physical activity. Moreover, The American College of Sports Medicine and American Heart Association Guidelines highlight the importance of physical activity being increased gradually in older adults, particularly those that are very deconditioned. Participants used the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) to report their perceived exertion during each exercise session; these scores were used to guide the progression to more challenging exercise levels each week. The intended RPE exercises 2-6 was achieved (mean RPE score for exercises 2-6 was 12+/-2). Considering the above, we do not believe that the intensity of the exercise programme affected the trial feasibility outcomes.</p>
              <p>4. Barthel Index scores are now presented as median and interquartile range. The results are presented in the Results section titled ‘Physical Function and Patient Reported Outcome Measures’.</p>
              <p>Thank you for considering our revised manuscript. We hope that you are satisfied with our responses and we look forward to hearing from you.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
