                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Improving physical activity (PA) and healthy eating is critical for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Behaviour change programmes delivered in sporting clubs can engage men in health behaviour change, but are rarely sustained or scaled-up post trial. Following the success of pilot studies of the Australian Fans in Training (Aussie-FIT) programme, a hybrid effectiveness–implementation trial protocol was developed. This protocol outlines methods to: (1) establish if Aussie-FIT is effective at supporting men with or at risk of CVD to sustain improvements in moderate-to-vigorous PA (primary outcome), diet and physical and psychological health and (2) examine the feasibility and utility of implementation strategies to support programme adoption, implementation and sustainment.</p>

                  <p>A pragmatic multistate/territory hybrid type 2 effectiveness–implementation parallel group randomised controlled trial with a 6-month wait list control arm in Australia. 320 men aged 35–75 years with or at risk of CVD will be recruited. Aussie-FIT involves 12 weekly face-to-face sessions including coach-led interactive education workshops and PA delivered in Australian Football League (Western Australia, Northern Territory) and rugby (Queensland) sports club settings. Follow-up measures will be at 3 and 6 months (both groups) and at 12 months to assess maintenance (intervention group only). Implementation outcomes will be reported using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The cardiovascular benefits of physical activity (PA) and eating a healthy diet are well established; however, 55% of people who live in Australia do not meet PA guidelines, most eat an unhealthy diet and 67% are living with overweight or obesity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Among those with a cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, exercise adherence remains low. Most men with CVD fail to initiate or sustain health behaviour changes, decreasing quality of life and increasing risk of future CVD and premature death.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For instance, only 30% of patients complete outpatient cardiac rehabilitation, and of those, less than 50% are sufficiently active 12 months after their cardiac event.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>A patient survey showed many patients lack self-management skills and are too dependent on exercise rehabilitation staff to sustain behaviour changes on completion of hospital-based exercise programmes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Recent estimates suggest that increasing participation in cardiac rehabilitation in Australia from 30% to 65% would result in $A36 million in healthcare savings, $A58 million in social and economic benefits and significantly reduce annual heart attack admissions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> To reap these health and economic benefits, new strategies are required to increase PA adherence and healthy eating in people with or at risk of CVD. Gender-tailored programmes are important, because men and women experience differences in CVDs risks and occurrences.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Gender-tailored health behaviour change programmes for men have been shown to be appealing and effective.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>The internationally recognised ‘Football Fans in Training’ (FFIT) programme and our Australian adaptation (Australian Fans in Training (Aussie-FIT)) are effective in engaging men to improve their health behaviours. FFIT<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and Aussie-FIT<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> capitalise on men’s interest in sport to promote weight loss via sustained improvements in diet and PA. These structured 12-week programmes include 90 min of interactive education and group-based PA that aims to develop the skills and confidence of participants to self-regulate and maintain long-term behaviour change. Programmes are delivered to groups of men by trained coaches in professional sports facilities. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FFIT was established in a randomised control trial (RCT).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Mean between group weight lost at 12 months was 5 kg, and average weight loss maintenance of 2.9 kg was observed in the intervention group 3.5 years post baseline.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> FFIT was adapted for the European Fans in Training (EuroFIT) RCT in five European countries, where similar findings were revealed.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Kwasnicka <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> demonstrated feasibility of recruitment, engagement and retention of men living with overweight and obesity, as well as acceptability of the Aussie-FIT intervention and research procedures when delivered at top-tier Australian Football League (AFL) clubs in Western Australia (WA). Promising physical and mental health outcomes were observed.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In a single-arm prefeasibility trial in Queensland (QLD), a version of Aussie-FIT adapted for rugby league (League-FIT) has engaged men living with overweight and obesity and demonstrated promise in supporting positive physical and mental health outcomes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In a feasibility study of the Aussie-FIT programme undertaken at second-tier AFL clubs for men with CVD, Smith <italic toggle="yes">et al,</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> (manuscript in preparation) demonstrated feasibility of participant engagement and retention, and acceptability of the intervention and research procedures. However, recruiting men with CVD was challenging (Smith <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>, manuscript in progress). Recruitment challenges were likely due to the smaller population of men with CVD (6.5% of men in Australia)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> compared with 75% of men with overweight and obesity in Australia,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the smaller fanbases of second-tier AFL clubs compared with top-tier clubs. The effectiveness of Aussie-FIT remains to be tested, as do implementation strategies designed to improve the adoption, implementation, sustainment and scale-up of the programme to reach diverse populations of at-risk men. This multistate/multiterritory trial aims to establish the effectiveness of the Aussie-FIT intervention for men with or at risk of CVD, while allowing for flexibility with club size (eg, top tier or second tier) across diverse Australian contexts.</p>
              <p>A recent systematic review of five unique interventions concluded that, while FFIT has been successfully scaled up, not all health promotion interventions delivered through professional sport have been successfully scaled up, and thus a greater focus on the potential for scalability of these interventions is required.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Scalability is the process of increasing the number of implementers (eg, sports clubs) that are willing to initiate delivery of effective interventions to reach a greater proportion of the target population.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The potential for intervention scalability is increasingly considered across the research spectrum, rather than solely positioned at the end of a linear research pipeline after effectiveness testing.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> One increasingly common approach to considering implementation and scalability earlier in the research process is the use of hybrid effectiveness–implementation study designs, which allow for the assessment of intervention effectiveness alongside implementation outcomes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Implementation outcomes that are important for scalability include programme costs, fidelity, adaptability, delivery settings, infrastructure, workforce, reach and acceptability in diverse populations (Milat <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> 2020).</p>
              <p>This trial adopts a hybrid effectiveness–implementation design<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> to examine the effectiveness of Aussie-FIT, and in parallel assess the feasibility and utility of implementation strategies to support programme adoption, implementation, sustainment and scalability, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. We pose two research questions to simultaneously address both the intervention and the implementation process aims<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>: (1) is the Aussie-FIT programme effective in increasing time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and improving other secondary outcomes among men with or at risk of CVD at 6-month follow-up; and (2) what are the facilitators and barriers to implementation, sustainment and scalability of the Aussie-FIT programme?</p>

                <p>Patient and public engagement has been central to the development of the Aussie-FIT programme since its inception and in previous pilot studies in which the intervention was developed based on patient priorities. In preparation for and in the design of this trial, community advisory groups consisting of consumers (ie, men with or at risk of CVD, and former Aussie-FIT participants) and stakeholders (eg, Aussie-FIT coaches, sporting club or community representatives) have been formed in each state/territory. These groups include representation of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander men. The first of these groups met in December 2022. Community advisory groups have helped identify potential barriers and enablers of project success and have codesigned responsive implementation strategies. These groups will continue to work in partnership with the research team throughout the lifespan of this project. This will include providing input on culturally appropriate recruitment strategies, retention strategies, involvement in dissemination planning and if the effectiveness of the intervention is established, providing advice on the sustainment and scalability of Aussie-FIT. The outcomes of our cross-site consumer and stakeholder involvement activities during the trial set-up period, and at later stages in the trial, will be reported in future publications. Presentations and reports for consumers and stakeholders will be codesigned with consumers and stakeholders and disseminated to participants and other consumer and community audiences.</p>

                <p>The intervention is described following the Template for Intervention Description and Replication guidance,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. In brief, the 12, weekly, 90 min sessions will be delivered to groups of 16 men. One coach and one accredited exercise physiologist (AEP) or equivalent suitable health professional facilitate each group. Coaches and AEPs will be trained by the research team in the core content (PA and diet education), safe exercise for men with or at risk of CVD and in the use of principles of motivation and behaviour change. Coaches will lead on the programme content delivery and AEPs will be primarily responsible for exercise safety. Practical activities and discussions are designed to help men understand why and how to improve PA (eg, understanding exercise intensities, safe strength training, decreasing sedentary time) and dietary behaviours (eg, interpreting food labels, portion sizes, meal planning, eating out) and incorporate behaviour change techniques to support participants to adopt positive health behaviours in their daily lives. A range of PA intensities are promoted, and ball skills and circuit training like those undertaken by professional players but modified to be safe for each man’s limitations (eg, ball skill drills restricted to walking) undertaken. Men are encouraged to self-monitor walking, gradually increasing steps/day throughout the 12 weeks. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> provides a week-by-week overview of session content. The AEP will codeliver the sessions and support the coach by monitoring participants (eg, blood pressure checks), providing advice on safe exercise and providing first aid, if required. The wait list control group (another 16 men from each club) will receive the programme 6 months later.</p>

                        <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Undertaking sufficient physical activity and healthy eating is critical to prevent people with lived experience of or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) from experiencing future heart problems. However, most people with or at risk of CVD fail to initiate or sustain these long-term health behaviours. This increases risks of future heart conditions and premature death. CVD is more common in men, but they are less likely than women to access interventions to help them manage their weight or improve their health behaviours.</td>

Coaches will receive a detailed intervention delivery guide and educational resources (eg, wallet cards to assess food labels) to support delivery of the weekly sessions. Coaches will use sports equipment (eg, Australian Football League and rugby league balls) from their respective clubs. The participant workbook and coach session delivery guides have previously been used in the Australian Fans in Training (Aussie-FIT) pilot studies. The participant workbook and coach session delivery guide were developed (and educational materials sourced), adapted from resources available from: Football Fans in Training programme, <ext-link xlink:href="www.ffit.org.uk" ext-link-type="uri">www.ffit.org.uk</ext-link>; Heart Foundation Australia, <ext-link xlink:href="www.heartfoundation.org.au" ext-link-type="uri">www.heartfoundation.org.au</ext-link>; Australian Government Department of Health, National Health and Medical Research Council, <ext-link xlink:href="www.eatforhealth.gov.au" ext-link-type="uri">www.eatforhealth.gov.au</ext-link>; Alcohol Think Again, <ext-link xlink:href="www.alcoholthinkagain.com.au" ext-link-type="uri">www.alcoholthinkagain.com.au</ext-link>; and Cancer Council Western Australia (WA), <ext-link xlink:href="www.cancerwa.asn.au" ext-link-type="uri">www.cancerwa.asn.au</ext-link>.

The education involves practical activities and discussions to help men understand why and how to improve their diet (eg, interpreting food labels, portion sizes, meal planning, eating out) and physical activity habits (eg, understanding exercise intensities, safe strength training, decreasing sedentary time). Men will be encouraged to use behaviour change techniques (eg, self-monitoring, goal setting and problem-solving) to help put the recommendations into practice. Participants take part in physical activity within the sessions that starts off slowly in the initial weeks and gradually builds up over the course of the programme. Activities men participate in include ball skills and circuit training similar to that undertaken by Australian football and rugby league players but modified to be safe for each man’s abilities (eg, ball skill drills restricted to walking). Men are encouraged to self-monitor walking, gradually increasing steps/day throughout the 12 weeks.</td>

Aussie-FIT coaches will be already embedded in their respective clubs, knowledgeable about Australian Football or Rugby League, and have experience of leading physical activity or sports coaching sessions. Coaches should have good communication skills and the ability to help foster a supportive atmosphere with camaraderie between participants. Accredited exercise physiologists (AEPs), or other suitably qualified/accredited health professionals, will act as an assistant coach and cofacilitate programme delivery. They will support the coach by undertaking any required health monitoring of participants (eg, blood pressure checks), provide advice on safe exercise and provide first aid, if required. Club coaches and AEPs will be trained by the research team in the core programme content (physical activity, nutrition, motivation, behaviour change). The training is delivered face to face and comprises approximately 15 hours of interactive learning content and opportunities to practice session deliveries and receive feedback from the research team and peers.</td>

The programme is not prescriptive in terms of physical activity and dietary changes the men make outside of the weekly sessions. Men are supported to self-monitor their diet and physical activity behaviours, then make their own education-informed decisions on setting goals that are relevant to them. Health behaviour change goals that are self-determined are more likely to be sustainable. Personalised feedback on goals men set is provided by coaches and peers in weekly sessions throughout the programme. Targeted behaviours for goal setting include portion size control, reduction of sugary drinks and energy dense foods, reduction in alcohol consumption, gradual increases in physical activity and reduced sedentary time. Men participating in Aussie-FIT will have varying physical fitness levels and health conditions. Throughout the programme AEPs and coaches will modify the physical activity within the sessions to suit men with differing physical capabilities. AEPs and coaches will be aware of pre-existing conditions and will interact with and observe participants during the programme sessions and tailor activities as required.</td>

                <title>Description of the implementation strategy</title>
                <p>Our consumer advisory groups have supported the development of our implementation strategies in the study set-up phase of this project, full details of which will be reported elsewhere. The implementation study is structured by the RE-AIM framework.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
                <p>Reach: programme recruitment strategies have been codesigned with men with or at risk of CVD. These strategies will be tailored for each state/territory in consultation with community advisory groups.</p>
                <p>Effectiveness: individual effectiveness outcomes will be tested via the RCT. Negative or unintended consequences will also be documented.</p>
                <p>Adoption: clubs will be invited to offer formal commitments to continue deliveries pending further funding opportunities in each state/territory. An infrastructure and costing model will be developed to support clubs in sustaining the programme, and preferences for models of sustained programme deliveries will be codesigned with stakeholders.</p>
                <p>Implementation: a comprehensive coach delivery package will support fidelity of programme delivery. this package includes 15 hours of training for the coaches, detailed programme delivery speaking notes, a timing guide and rationales. Reusable teaching resources will also be provided to support high-quality delivery. Implementation costs, such as coaches’ time for delivering and preparing for sessions, have been included in the programme costing model.</p>
                <p>Maintenance: our nested SWAT will evaluate an automated enrolment strategy, designed to improve programme sustainability when fewer resources are available compared with the trial phase. Resource sharing agreements will be developed, if required, to ensure the intervention materials can continue to be used post trial. Sustainability action plans will be developed with stakeholders, including identifying suitable charities as delivery partners for ongoing programme deliveries. Indications of individual participant-level behaviour change maintenance will be assessed at 12-month follow-up in the intervention group.</p>
                <p>Throughout the implementation process, barriers and facilitators to implementation will be identified (by stakeholders, including consumers and researchers) and targeted in future modifications to the programme. Interviews with stakeholders will be conducted to identify these barriers and facilitators. Contextual adaptations required for the different States and Territories will be documented and evaluated. These adaptations will be codesigned with our consumer advisory groups to ensure contextual fit while preserving fidelity.</p>

                <title>Blinding and randomisation</title>
                <p>Blinding participants to the condition is not possible due to the nature of the intervention. Data collectors will be blinded as far as possible. Questionnaire data will be completed online, PA data will be device measured, and participants will be asked not to reveal whether they are in the intervention or wait list control arm, when objective measures of weight and blood pressure are taken.</p>
                <p>Aligned with the EuroFIT trial, we propose an individual randomisation for each club, given the FFIT study confirmed that the minimal between-group contamination effects did not warrant higher sample size and costs of a cluster trial.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Participants from each club (10 clubs, 32 participants per club) will be individually randomised (1:1 randomisation, in blocks of 8 to reduce prediction of group allocation). A statistician generated the randomisation list using the RANDOMBETWEEN<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> function using Excel. The statistician, who is not involved in data collection, will not be told if group 1 or group 2 is the intervention arm to assure blindness during the analyses. Following completion of baseline measures, trained research assistants will use opaque, sealed envelopes to assign participants to intervention or control arms.</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>Participants will book an appointment to attend baseline measures (detailed in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>) at the football or rugby club. Measurement sessions will be led by a team of trained research assistants. Participants will be asked to complete a survey, which will be presented to them on an iPad using Qualtrics software. The self-administered survey will ask men demographic questions including their age, ethnicity, education, marital status, current employment status, income and housing status. Weight, height and waist measurements will be taken by a trained researcher. Cholesterol will be checked using a finger-prick test that measures non-fasting cholesterol immediately. Participants will undertake a 24-hour dietary recall using the Intake24, an open-source self-completed computerised dietary recall system based on multiple pass 24-hour recall. A trained interviewer will assist participants to complete the recall. The self-administered survey will also include items assessing alcohol content, and participants will also be asked to respond to questions assessing their emotions (ie, positive and negative affect), quality of life, self-esteem, motivation to for PA and use of behaviour change strategies taught in Aussie-FIT (automaticity, goal conflict, goal facilitation, coping planning, action planning). Participants are asked to respond on Likert scales of 1–5 or 1–7. Participants can skip questions if they prefer not to answer them. All questions have established psychometric properties and have been used by the research team in studies with similar populations. The questionnaire pack should take less than 30 min to complete. A trained research assistant will be available to explain to participants how to complete the survey and to answer any questions they may have during completion of the questionnaire. All participants will be required to complete the Exercise and Sport Science Australia (ESSA): Adult Pre-Exercise Screening System (APSS)<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> at the baseline measures session. ESSA stipulates that all participants who answer ‘yes’ to a screening question should see an allied health professional or their GP. To reduce the burden on participants of the need to attend a GP appointment, an AEP (or other equivalent allied health professional) will review every participant’s APSS form and discuss medical history with every participant, to determine whether they are at risk from PA. Wait list control group participants will be rescreened at the assessment they attend prior to starting the programme in case of any change in health status from baseline.</p>
                <p>The full assessment process will usually take about 90 min. Following randomisation, participants will be informed as to whether they will receive the 12-week intervention immediately (ie, the intervention arm) or ~6 months later (ie, the wait list control group). Once the intervention arm participants have completed the programme, the assessment package will be repeated for both the control and intervention groups (3 months post baseline) and then at 6 months post baseline. After the 6 months measures, the wait list control arm will complete the 12-week programme. Finally, the intervention arm will be asked to attend one final assessment, 12 months post baseline.</p>
                <p>Where applicable, information regarding the participants’ CVD diagnosis will be self-reported or obtained from medical records. Participant attendance at the programme will also be recorded. At baseline, participants will be asked to tick yes or no to the question ‘in the future we may wish to contact you to join a group or individual interview to talk about your experiences in the programme. Do you consent for us to contact you? Yes/No’. Approximately 20 of those who tick ‘yes’, will be contacted by telephone or email at 6 months and/or 12 months, and invited to take part in an interview, which will be conducted on Microsoft Teams videoconference or in person at the football/rugby club (depending on the person’s preference). Interview questions will be developed in collaboration with PhD candidates and an ethics amendment will be submitted for approval prior to undertaking any interviews. Any changes to the protocol will be reported on the study Open Science Framework page (<ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/ev8px/" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/ev8px/</ext-link>).</p>

To be classified as MVPA mean acceleration needs to be ≥100 mg.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Time in activities lasting at least 1 min, for which 80% of the activity satisfied the 100 mg threshold criteria, will be calculated. Average acceleration (calculated as the mean acceleration across the 24-hour day as a proxy for the daily volume of PA) and intensity gradient (as a reflection of the distribution of intensity across the 24-hour day) will be calculated.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> We will only include in the analysis those participants with four or more valid days of accelerometry data, and at least 10 hours of wear time each day.</p>
                <p>Deidentified objective measurements, questionnaire data and calculated PA data will be exported to Stata software for analyses by an independent biostatistician blinded to the group allocation. The characteristics of the participants will be summarised in mean (and SD) or median (and IQR) or frequency (and percentage), by treatment groups. Programme efficacy will be analysed following the intention-to-treat principle and per-protocol approaches outlined below. Changes in the postintervention outcomes will be analysed using linear mixed-effect regression models while controlling for the baseline measures. Sensitivity analyses will also be performed to include covariates such as age, BMI, types of comorbidities in the model to compare the beta coefficient of the models with and without the covariates. If group sizes permit, subgroup analyses will be performed to examine differences in intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes between (1) states/territories, (2) men diagnosed with and without a CVD diagnosis, (3) men with BMI&gt;25 and men with BMI&lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and (4) men who identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and men who do not.

              <p>In 2022, CVD was the leading cause of burden of disease in Australia, and this burden is higher in males than females.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Insufficient PA and poor diet are key modifiable behavioural CVD risk factors. Pilot and feasibility studies of Aussie-FIT have illustrated that the programme is acceptable to men in WA, and feasible to deliver in AFL and West AFL clubs and rugby league clubs in QLD. Scale-up of Aussie-FIT in WA, and out to other states and territories creates an opportunity to reduce primary and secondary CVD risk among men with or at risk of CVD via modification of PA and dietary behaviours. Via this hybrid effectiveness–implementation trial, we will determine whether the programme is effective in improving health and health behaviours in men who take part, and test strategies to sustain longer term implementation of this programme.</p>
