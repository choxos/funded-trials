                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Female urinary incontinence (UI) is common affecting up to 45% of women. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the first-line treatment but there is uncertainty whether intensive PFMT is better than basic PFMT for long-term symptomatic improvement. It is also unclear which factors influence women’s ability to perform PFMT long term and whether this has impacts on long-term outcomes. OPAL (optimising PFMT to achieve long-term benefits) trial examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of basic PFMT versus biofeedback-mediated PFMT and this evaluation explores women’s experiences of treatment and the factors which influence effectiveness. This will provide data aiding interpretation of the trial findings; make recommendations for optimising the treatment protocol; support implementation in practice; and address gaps in the literature around long-term adherence to PFMT for women with stress or mixed UI.</p>

                  <p>This evaluation comprises a longitudinal qualitative case study and process evaluation (PE). The case study aims to explore women’s experiences of treatment and adherence and the PE will explore factors influencing intervention effectiveness. The case study has a two-tailed design and will recruit 40 women, 20 from each trial group; they will be interviewed four times over 2 years. Process data will be collected from women through questionnaires at four time-points, from health professionals through checklists and interviews and by sampling 100 audio recordings of appointments. Qualitative analysis will use case study methodology (qualitative study) and the framework technique (PE) and will interrogate for similarities and differences between the trial groups regarding barriers and facilitators to adherence. Process data analyses will examine fidelity, engagement and mediating factors using descriptive and interpretative statistics.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Urinary incontinence (UI), the involuntary loss of urine, is a common condition in women. The prevalence of UI depends on the definition, using a broad definition between 5% and 69% is reported but most studies report the range 25%–45% of women internationally.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The main types of UI are stress, urgency and mixed incontinence, with stress incontinence being the most prevalent affecting approximately 50% of women with UI; mixed UI affects 7.5%–25% and urgency affects approximately 1%–7% of women with UI. The cost to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) was estimated at £233 million in 2000<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and the personal costs to women estimated to be £178 million.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the first line treatment for stress and mixed UI<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and there is good evidence to show PFMT is effective in the short term.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, it is not clear whether or how common intensifiers of PFMT (eg, more contact with health professionals, use of adjuncts such as biofeedback) increase longer-term PFMT adherence and the duration of effect. A recent series summarising the PFMT adherence literature<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–11</xref> does suggest that self-efficacy is one factor influencing women’s ability to continue to perform self-care, such as PFMT, after treatment but there is a need for more research in this area to identify the full range of factors and how these impact on their UI symptoms in the longer term.</p>
              <p>Biofeedback (audio and/or visual feedback from a pressure or force-sensitive or electromyography device of a contraction of pelvic floor muscles) is often used as an adjunct to PFMT. A Cochrane review of the effectiveness of PFMT augmented with biofeedback concluded that women receiving biofeedback were more likely to report improved symptoms or cure than women who did not receive biofeedback; however, the effect might be confounded by greater amounts of health professional contact in women receiving biofeedback.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As a result, Hagen and colleagues are conducting a large multicentre randomised control trial of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of long-term adherence to basic versus biofeedback-mediated intensive PFMT for female stress or mixed UI (OPAL), with the same amount of health professional contact in both trial groups.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Unique to the trials conducted so far in this field, the OPAL trial has an embedded mixed-methods process evaluation (PE) to explore factors impacting on short-term and long-term adherence to PFMT, and any other mediating factors for treatment delivery and effectiveness. This PE will draw on analysis of multiple datasets generated throughout the trial including the interviews with the therapists, audio recorded consultations, treatment checklists and trial participant questionnaires, as well as on the findings from the longitudinal qualitative interviews exploring women’s experiences of the OPAL intervention.</p>

                <title>The OPAL trial</title>
                <p>The OPAL trial is a large multicentre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial of two active treatment interventions, basic PFMT and biofeedback-mediated PFMT for the treatment of stress or mixed UI. The trial has been fully described in the companion trial protocol paper and further information is available on the trial website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.opaltrial.co.uk">www.opaltrial.co.uk</ext-link>). In brief, ‘Intensive’ PFMT consists of basic PFMT with adjunctive biofeedback at every clinic appointment and at home. Both ‘basic’ and ‘intensive’ treatment groups are offered six clinic appointments over the 16-week intervention period. Women in both groups receive pelvic floor muscle assessment,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> vaginal palpation, verbal feedback and individualised exercise prescription based on this assessment, advice for bowel and bladder symptoms and tailored lifestyle advice. Treatment is delivered by women’s health physiotherapists or continence nurses who have received training designed and delivered by the trial team.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The premise is that biofeedback will intensify PFMT by offering women more visible information about exercise outcomes, support motivation and enhance behavioural skill (eg, improved contraction technique and confidence). The anticipated outcome of adjunctive biofeedback is improved quality and quantity of exercise, with the expectation that this will increase treatment benefit and reduce symptoms. However, the biofeedback intervention can only work to intensify PFMT if women use the device.</p>

                <title>The OPAL longitudinal qualitative case study and PE</title>
                <p>The OPAL evaluation has a comprehensive and well-resourced longitudinal qualitative comparative case study and mixed-method PE running parallel to the trial to provide important insights into the trial’s processes and outcomes: to explain how the interventions worked (what factors led to the observed effect); assist in interpretation of the trial findings; and facilitate transferability into clinical practice (if effective) and further research (in particular if not effective). This design is rather unusual but allows the researchers to preserve multiple perspectives and contribute to the robustness of the complex analysis of factors mediating the trial delivery and findings. These studies will be cross-referenced to support more comprehensive explanations of how the interventions work and assist in interpreting the trial findings. We describe each study in more detail below:</p>
                <p>The qualitative case study is longitudinal in nature to mirror the trial data collection, to capture the dynamic nature of treatment delivery and participants’ experiences, to generate more in-depth data about what works well (or not) when intensifying treatment regimens, and most importantly, in this trial to better understand the factors important to long-term adherence to PFMT. Within the trials literature, this longitudinal methodological design is rare, but it is needed to capture the dynamic nature of implementation and adherence to long-term PFMT treatment regimens; furthermore, the commissioning call for this work explicitly requested a qualitative study to explore women’s experience and barriers to adherence. This qualitative case study will also make an important contribution to understanding the behavioural aspects of therapy which are rarely documented.</p>
                <p>The PE aims to provide transparency by exploring the implementation of the interventions in context.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Variation in implementation of the OPAL interventions is likely to be due to: the different intervention components; the diverse clinical settings (university hospital, district general hospital, community settings) and health professionals delivering (women’s health physiotherapists and incontinence specialist nurses); and, the contextual and personal differences between women receiving the interventions and adhering to PFMT long-term. These different factors are likely to influence how well the interventions are integrated within existing practice and women’s lives and may impact on the trial findings. As a result, we believe it is important to explore delivery (including fidelity and dose—if the intervention components are being delivered as intended and in what quantity across the different trial centres), response (participant’s experiences of the intervention) and maintenance (how and why these processes are sustained over time or not by women and therapists during the intervention delivery and by women after the intervention delivery is complete).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> For delivery, we are particularly interested in fidelity of function<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> as clinicians were given a protocol to follow with the expectation that they would individualise this (the exact exercise prescription, lifestyle advice and so on) to the care each woman required; however, there were also specific behaviour change techniques that were to be used for all women (and not individualised) and so we will also be investigating fidelity of form for this element of the interventions. Women’s experiences of receiving treatment in the clinic and how they engage with PFMT at home is important to how they respond to the interventions. As OPAL is interested in long-term adherence to PFMT, it is important to explore how women maintain their adherence (or not) and the factors which facilitated or impeded this. It is hypothesised that self-efficacy will be a mediating factor to intervention effectiveness. The longitudinal qualitative case study will support the PE by providing data on ‘response’ and ‘maintenance’ to explain the women’s experiences of receiving treatment, how and why they engaged with PFMT and/or biofeedback PFMT in the clinic and at home during treatment and how and why they maintained engagement (or not) over time.</p>

Purposively selected women, who have consented to the trial, will be given an additional information leaflet and asked if they are interested in taking part in an interview study. Interested women will be contacted by telephone approximately a week later to ask if they would like to participate. If a woman declines to consent to the interview study, another woman with similar characteristics will be selected and approached. Formal written consent will be collected at the time of the first face-to-face interview. We anticipate some attrition of women by the 12-month and 24-month interviews, however, we have oversampled to ensure sufficient heterogeneity to identify barriers and facilitators to respond to the interventions, and to generate hypotheses about the factors associated with differing outcomes, including long-term adherence to PFMT.</p>

Each centre will be provided with a password-protected audio digital recorder to record the selected appointments. We will aim to oversample audio recordings for the first and last appointments due to our a priori hypothesis that treatment delivery may be more intensive and concentrated in the first and last appointments. The first appointment is a longer consultation and involves important education and training for being taught how to properly perform PFMT, where relevant including the teaching of biofeedback, and for understanding any changes to lifestyle that may be recommended. The last appointment is important because therapy is coming to an end and women are being given important information to allow them to self-care, such as instructions regarding the maintenance dose of PFMT. If participants have signed on their consent form that they are willing to have an appointment audio recorded, the researcher will purposively select participants and telephone them to ask if they would be willing to have a specific appointment recorded, answer any questions they may have and to take verbal consent. Therapists will then be informed which participants and appointments to record.
