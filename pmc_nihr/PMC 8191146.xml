                  <p>73/185 (39%) potentially eligible patients were randomised. Twenty participants were withdrawn, 11 due to not receiving rotator cuff repair. The between-group difference in proportions of participants who exceeded the cut-off of 222.6 hours out of the sling was 50% (80% CI = 29%, 72%), with the early patient-directed rehabilitation group reporting greater time out of sling. 52/73 (71%) and 52/53 (98%) participants were followed-up at 12 weeks when withdrawals were included and excluded respectively. Eighteen full-thickness re-tears were reported (early patient-directed rehabilitation = 7, standard rehabilitation = 11). Five serious adverse events were reported.</p>

              <p>Shoulder pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal pain presentations with disorders of the rotator cuff, the muscles and tendons surrounding the shoulder, widely regarded as the most common contributing factor.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The prevalence of rotator cuff abnormalities, including rotator cuff tears, increases with age.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>We conducted a two-arm, multi-centre pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial (<xref rid="fig1-0269215520978859" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit programme (PB-PG-0816-20009). This study was sponsored by Keele University (RG-0038-16-PCHS). A favourable ethical review was granted by the Wales Research Ethics Committee 5 Bangor on 31st July 2018 (18/WA/0242). The protocol was registered on the ISRCTN Registry (18357968) on 10 August 2018 and is available via <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN18357968" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN18357968</ext-link>.

              <p>We worked with patients to develop study processes including recruitment, and develop patient-facing materials including participant information sheets. Additionally patient representatives contributed to study management through the Trial Management Group, study oversight through membership of the Trial Steering Committee, and decisions about next steps.</p>
              <p>Patients for the randomised controlled trial were identified, invited, screened and recruited from the orthopaedic departments of five National Health Service hospitals in England according to the following criteria:</p>
              <list list-type="simple" id="list1-0269215520978859">
                <list-item>

              </list>
              <p>Patients were excluded if it was deemed that they were unable to give full informed consent.</p>
              <p>After providing written informed consent, participants were randomly allocated to early patient-directed rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation at variable time points but prior to surgery. Stratified block (block sizes of two and four by recruiting site) randomisation on a 1:1 ratio was undertaken remotely using web-based randomisation, developed and supported by Keele Clinical Trials Unit, to ensure allocation concealment and parity in numbers per treatment group per recruitment site.</p>
              <p>Early patient-directed rehabilitation included advice from a physiotherapist to remove the post-operative sling as soon as possible and gradually begin actively using their arm as soon as able within acceptable limits of their pain. Discomfort with movement was permissible providing it was acceptable to the individual participant. Sling removal and movement was progressed by the individual participant over time and according to agreed goals within the context of their own pain experience and tolerance.</p>
              <p>In contrast, standard rehabilitation included advice from a physiotherapist to maintain the sling in situ at all times for four weeks and only to remove it while eating, washing, dressing and performing daily exercises prescribed by the physiotherapist.</p>
              <p>The key difference between early patient-directed rehabilitation and standard rehabilitation was the advice and support to remove the sling and move the arm, or not. From four weeks post-surgery, both groups continued a similar programme of rehabilitation supported by a physiotherapist. The physiotherapists received study specific training and were able to treat patients in both groups.</p>
              <p>The main measures for determining feasibility were:</p>

              <p>Clinical status and outcomes were collected at baseline, 6-weeks and 12-weeks post-surgery by postal questionnaire. The Oxford Shoulder Score is a 12-item shoulder-specific self-report measure which is reliable, valid, responsive and acceptable to patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr15-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index is also a shoulder-specific self-report measure which is reliable, valid, responsive and is the most commonly used outcome measure in randomised controlled trials of non-surgical interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr18-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health related quality of life that provides a single index value for health status.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Other clinical outcomes included global rating of change on a 6-point ordinal scale, time taken to return to driving, and days lost from work. A patient-completed diary detailing time spent out of sling and adherence with exercise was also completed for four weeks post-surgery. Two text messages were sent each week for 12 weeks; the first asking about pain in the last week and the second asking about work or activity interference, both on a 5-point ordered categorical scale derived from the Oxford Shoulder Score. At 12-weeks post-surgery, a diagnostic ultrasound scan was undertaken to determine the number of rotator cuff tendon re-tears. Number of adverse events post-surgery were collected up to 12-weeks post-surgery via clinician and patient self-report questionnaire.</p>
              <p>The following pre-specified success criteria were agreed:</p>
              <list list-type="simple" id="list3-0269215520978859">
                <list-item>
                  <p>(1) Consent and randomisation of 20% or more of eligible patients</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>(2) Difference in time with arm out of the sling of 40% or more, that is, the early patient-directed rehabilitation group would report 40% more time out of the sling than the standard rehabilitation group in the first four weeks after surgery</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>(3) Follow up rates for potential main outcome measure(s) &gt;70% for questionnaires and text messages.</p>
                </list-item>
              </list>
              <p>Surgeons were blinded to group allocation until after the surgery to minimise the likelihood of withdrawal through knowledge of the allocated intervention. Ultrasound scan findings were withheld from patient participants and clinicians. No further measures to blind participants, clinicians, research team or oversight committees were implemented.</p>
              <p>The sample size was based on the ability to detect a difference in time spent out of sling between the two randomised groups. Allowing 20% for missing adherence-related data, 76 participants would provide 90% power to detect at least a minimum 40% difference in sling use between the two groups, given 1-sided 5% significance level.</p>
              <p>As this was a pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial, the analysis focuses mainly on description of feasibility outcomes. Mean values and confidence intervals of clinical outcomes are calculated, as well as sensitivity to change of the Oxford Shoulder Score and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index by examining the effect size statistic, standardised response mean and Guyatt responsiveness index. To evaluate the difference in time spent out of sling between groups, a cut-off of 222.6 hours over four weeks (7.95 hours per day) was identified as the time whereby 30% of the standard rehabilitation group exceeded that cut-off. The detailed statistical analysis plan was agreed with the independent Trial Steering Committee before the end of recruitment and prior to commencing analysis.</p>

Over 12 weeks, the sensitivity to change for both the Oxford Shoulder Score and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index according to the effect size statistic were 0.89 and 1.29, the standardised response mean were 0.71 and 0.86, and the Guyatt responsiveness index based on effect size were 1.18 and 1.21, respectively.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Based on these findings, a fully powered randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early patient-directed rehabilitation versus standard rehabilitation would be feasible with minor amendment to the research design. With reference to our predefined success criteria, 73/189 (39%) eligible patients were recruited, exceeding the target of 20%. A 50% proportional difference was identified between the groups for time spent out of sling (14/17 in the early patient-directed rehabilitation group, 8/25 in the standard rehabilitation group), exceeding the target of 40%. When withdrawals are included, the target of over 70% follow-up rates for the potential primary outcome measures at six weeks (50/73; 68%) was not met. This was met at 12 weeks (52/73; 71%) but would be regarded as insufficient in the context of a future randomised controlled trial with longer term follow-up.</p>
              <p>The findings suggest that recruitment of eligible patients is feasible and that advice and support to remove the sling, and vice versa, enables a valid comparison between early and standard rehabilitation, incorporating four weeks of sling immobilisation. The principal issue faced was withdrawal due to participants not receiving rotator cuff repair surgery or not receiving surgery at all (11/73), an issue reported in other rotator cuff repair randomised controlled trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> When withdrawals are not included, the follow-up rates at 6 and 12 weeks were 94% and 98% suggesting that the randomised controlled trial follow-up processes were robust. We randomly allocated participants at variable time-points before surgery which risks the withdrawals we observed. In a future randomised controlled trial, consenting participants before surgery but randomly allocating once rotator cuff repair surgery has been undertaken would address this. We also observed six withdrawals requested by surgeons due to perceived risk of early patient-directed rehabilitation. This reason for withdrawal was more common in the early patient-directed rehabilitation group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5) compared to the standard rehabilitation group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1). Therefore in a future randomised controlled trial, working with surgeons who are in equipoise with regard to the comparison of early patient-directed rehabilitation and standard rehabilitation will be paramount.</p>
              <p>In a fully powered randomised controlled trial, the target sample size would be 658 randomised participants (329 in each treatment arm) if the following assumptions were adopted; 90% power and 5% two-sided statistical significance to detect a minimally clinically important difference of eight points<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> between the two treatment groups at 12 weeks on the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, assuming a standard deviation of 30 (conservative estimate from this pilot RCT) and accounting for an expected 10% loss to follow-up.</p>
              <p>Other recent randomised controlled trials have been reported.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Mazzocca et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 73) compared early movement (starting two to three days after surgery) versus delayed movement (starting 28 days after surgery), similar to standard rehabilitation reported here. There was no statistically significant difference in Western Ontario Rotator Cuff scores at six months, but the early movement group reported lower scores (better clinical status) throughout the post-operative period. After six months, there was no difference in re-tear rates (31% vs 34%). Sheps et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (n = 206) compared sling weaning and early pain-free mobilisation versus standard rehabilitation, including immobilisation, following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (all tear sizes included). They reported statistically significant improvement in range of movement at six weeks for the early mobilisation group, but no difference in other clinical outcomes. After one year there was no difference in re-tear rates (30% vs 33%) and after two years there was no difference in clinical outcomes. Tirefort et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 80) compared no sling versus the use of a sling for the first four post-operative weeks following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (small to medium tears included). There was a statistically significant improvement in range of movement at six and 12 weeks for the no sling group. At six months there was no difference in clinical outcomes or repair integrity.</p>
              <p>The findings of these randomised controlled trials reflect the results of our previous systematic review<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> suggesting that early mobilisation facilitates a more rapid recovery of uncertain clinical importance without long-term consequence. Despite this, most patients continue to be immobilised in a sling for up to six weeks with increasing tendency to immobilise as the size of the tear increases.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-0269215520978859" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In contrast to previous interventions evaluated in these randomised controlled trials, the RaCeR early patient-directed rehabilitation intervention is more progressive in nature in terms of encouragement to discard the sling immediately, permitting active movement, and enabling participants to use their acceptable symptom response as a guide. The clinical outcomes reported here provide a signal of effectiveness of early patient-directed rehabilitation given the upper bounds of the 80% confidence intervals for the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index and Oxford Shoulder Score include the upper limit of the range of minimal clinical important differences at 6 and 12 weeks.</p>
              <p>In this pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial we experienced a higher than expected number of withdrawals due to participants not receiving rotator cuff repair surgery. Despite this we were able to address our feasibility objectives and inform the development of a future main randomised controlled trial.</p>
              <p>Hence, in the context of the findings that a future main RaCeR randomised controlled trial is feasible, previous randomised controlled trials and the clinical outcomes reported here provide a signal of effectiveness and platform from which to conduct a high-quality fully powered randomised controlled trial comparing early patient-directed rehabilitation with standard rehabilitation. The implications of this study include the need to randomly allocate participants following surgery and to carefully consider clinician equipoise to minimise withdrawal.</p>
              <p>From this RaCeR pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial, we conclude that a fully powered randomised controlled trial is feasible but would require a minor change to randomly allocate participants following surgery, rather than pre-surgery, to counter the issue of withdrawal due to participants not receiving rotator cuff repair surgery. Additionally, consideration of equipoise of the participating clinicians with regard to comparison of the randomised controlled trial interventions will be paramount to further minimise withdrawals.</p>
