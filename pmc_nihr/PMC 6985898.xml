                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>This phase I trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a candidate tuberculosis vaccination regimen, ChAdOx1 85A prime-MVA85A boost, previously demonstrated to be protective in animal studies, in healthy UK adults.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We enrolled 42 healthy, BCG-vaccinated adults into 4 groups: low dose Starter Group (n = 6; ChAdOx1 85A alone), high dose groups; Group A (n = 12; ChAdOx1 85A), Group B (n = 12; ChAdOx1 85A prime – MVA85A boost) or Group C (n = 12; ChAdOx1 85A – ChAdOx1 85A prime – MVA85A boost). Safety was determined by collection of solicited and unsolicited vaccine-related adverse events (AEs). Immunogenicity was measured by antigen-specific <italic>ex-vivo</italic> IFN-γ ELISpot, IgG serum ELISA, and antigen-specific intracellular IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2 and IL-17.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>AEs were mostly mild/moderate, with no Serious Adverse Events. ChAdOx1 85A induced Ag85A-specific ELISpot and intracellular cytokine CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, which were not boosted by a second dose, but were boosted with MVA85A. Polyfunctional CD4+ T cells (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2) and IFN-γ+, TNF-α+ CD8+ T cells were induced by ChAdOx1 85A and boosted by MVA85A. ChAdOx1 85A induced serum Ag85A IgG responses which were boosted by MVA85A.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>A ChAdOx1 85A prime – MVA85A boost is well tolerated and immunogenic in healthy UK adults.</p>

              <p id="p0005">Tuberculosis (TB) is now the leading single infectious disease killer in the world despite an annual 2% reduction in TB worldwide. In 2017, an estimated 1.6 million people died from TB, with 10 million new cases throughout the world <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The End TB strategy of global eradication of TB seeks to address this pressing issue, and one of the most valuable tools for its success is the development of a safe and effective TB vaccine <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0010">The only licenced TB vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is highly effective at preventing TB meningitis and disseminated disease in children. However, the lack of consistent protection against adult pulmonary TB means a more universally effective vaccine is urgently needed. Subunit vaccines to boost the efficacy of BCG allow the retention of the protective benefits against systemic disease <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recombinant viral vectors have shown early promise in animal and human studies <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, however the first efficacy trial with recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA85A) expressing the highly conserved, immunodominant, <italic>Mycobacterial</italic> antigen 85A (Ag85A) did not confer additional protection over BCG alone in South African infants <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This was likely in part due to reduced immunogenicity seen in this setting. More potent regimens are therefore needed. Heterologous ‘prime-boost’ vaccination strategies, using different viral vectored vaccines expressing proteins from malaria, have shown strong and sustained cellular immune responses correlating with malaria protection <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A recombinant adenoviral vaccine candidate, AERAS-402, has been evaluated as a prime-boost regimen with MVA85A in a phase I clinical trial in healthy BCG-vaccinated UK adults. This heterologous prime-boost regime was well-tolerated and induced increased frequency of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recently, a protein adjuvanted subunit vaccine M72, conferred 54% protection against TB disease in <italic>M.tb</italic> latently infected subjects <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0015">ChAdOx1 85A is a novel chimpanzee adenoviral vectored vaccine expressing Ag85A. An advantage of simian adenoviral vectors over human adenoviral vectors is the low prevalence of pre-existing anti-vector antibodies in humans, a factor limiting the use of adenoviruses to date <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The vector, ChAdOx1, expressing two influenza antigens, NP and M1, has previously been evaluated in a small phase I dose escalation trial and was found to be safe and immunogenic <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Preclinical murine studies have demonstrated ChAdOx1 85A to be consistently protective when used as part of a BCG-ChAdOx1 85A-MVA85A immunisation regime <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The aim of this first-in-human experimental medicine trial was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 85A, alone and as a prime-boost regime with MVA85A in healthy, BCG-vaccinated UK adults.</p>

                <p id="p0025">Volunteers were recruited from the Oxford and Birmingham area, providing written informed consent prior to screening. Visits occurred at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford, and the NIHR Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Birmingham (NIHR WTCRF). All vaccination visits were at the CCVTM. Volunteers were healthy, aged between 18 and 55, and had received BCG vaccination from an independent source prior to screening (no less than 6 months prior to date of enrolment). Baseline biochemical and haematological analysis, serological testing for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were performed to ensure no abnormalities warranting exclusion. Latent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M.tb</italic>) infection (LTBI) was excluded at screening with a negative IFN-γ release assay response to ESAT-6 and CFP-10, by means of the T Spot.TB kit (Oxford Immunotec, UK) or QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube.

A safety review was performed once all volunteers in this group had reached D14 to ensure no safety concerns before proceeding to the predicted optimal dose of ChAdOx1 85A based on the previous Flu study <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. After successful safety review, the first Group A volunteer received ChAdOx1 85A at a dose of 2.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp with safety review 48 h later. No safety concerns were raised, and a further 23 volunteers were randomised to Group A (ChAdOx1 85A 2.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp at D0) or Group B (ChAdOx1 85A 2.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp at D0 with MVA85A 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> plaque forming units (pfu) boost at D56) using sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes prepared by an independent statistician and opened by the trial clinician at the time of volunteer enrolment. Following our previous trial results, where two doses of AERAS-402 followed by MVA85A was the most potent regime for the induction of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, we added Group C, whereby 12 volunteers were enrolled to receive two doses of ChAdOx1 85A 2.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp (D0 and D28) with MVA85A 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> pfu boost at D119.</p>
                <p id="p0040">All volunteers had a clinical review 30 and 60 min following vaccination. Expected local and systemic solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected by volunteers using a 7-day diary-card, and reviewed by the clinical team at follow-up visits along with vital signs. Starter Group and Group A were followed-up at: D2, D14, D28, D56, D84 and D168, Group B: D2, D14, D28, D56, D58, D63, D84, D140 and D224, and Group C: D2, D14, D28, D30, D42, D56, D119, D121, D126, D147, D203 and D287. Solicited and unsolicited AEs were graded mild, moderate or severe. Assignment of causality was conducted according to a pre-defined criteria specified in the protocol. Safety bloods were taken 14 days following ChAdOx1 85A and 7 days following MVA85A, with bloods also taken on the day of 2nd and 3rd vaccinations depending on the individual volunteer schedule. Blood for exploratory immunology was taken at all visits.</p>

              <p id="p0175">Vaccination with ChAdOx1 85A induced Ag85A-specific IFN-γ responses. As expected from previous studies, these responses were boosted with MVA85A vaccination, and the direct effect of homologous boosting with ChAdOx1 85A was minimal. AUC analysis of the Ag85A-specific IFN-γ ELISpot response 1-24 weeks after vaccination with MVA85A showed no significant difference between Group B and Group C, although both had higher median AUC responses than a previous trial of MVA85A when given alone. We have previously shown that potent Ag85A-specific immune responses were induced by MVA85A boosting of AERAS-402 vaccine in healthy UK adults, the magnitude of these boosted responses in the group that received two doses of AERAS-402 was comparable to those detected in Group C of the present trial (p = 0.176) and to a single dose of MVA85A (p = 0.728) <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The critical role of IFN-γ in control of TB has been reported in humans and animal models and we have shown that vaccine-induced <italic>Mycobacteria</italic>-specific IFN-γ secreting cells are associated with reduced risk of TB disease <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. ChAdOx1 85A did not enhance PPD IFN-γ responses; this might be attributed to the high PPD responses detected at baseline, which are expected in BCG-vaccinated individuals. Other cytokines are shown to play a role in protection against TB; blocking TNF-α is reported to be associated with susceptibility to TB <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, IL-2, another Th1 cytokine, induces proliferation and maintenance of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and IL-17 has been associated with protection against TB in mice and humans <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Production of these cytokines was also induced by ChAdOx1 85A and boosted by MVA85A.

The responses in subjects boosted with MVA85A were higher than those in the ChAdOx1 85A alone group, reflecting the superior immunogenicity of a prime-boost combination reported for other pathogens <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0180">Polyfunctional T cells have been shown to play a role in protection against intracellular pathogens and were shown to be induced by MVA85A vaccination <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Here we demonstrate that polyfunctional CD4+ T cells are induced by ChAdOx1 85A vaccination and homologous boosting was required to obtain polyfunctional CD8+ T cell responses, but had minimal effect on the detected polyfunctional CD4+ T cells responses.</p>
              <p id="p0185">Immune responses to viral vectors may potentially modify Ag85A-specific responses <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, to this end we have tested vector-specific cellular and humoral responses. Low baseline (D0) vector-specific IFN-γ responses were detected in volunteers from the 4 study groups (median ELISpot responses of 3 SFC/1 × 10<sup>6</sup> PBMC for MVA CD4, 4 SFC/1 × 10<sup>6</sup> PBMC for MVA CD8 of and 102 SFC/1 × 10<sup>6</sup> PBMC for ChAdOx1). A single dose of ChAdOx1 85A induced ChAdOx1-specific IFN-γ responses but were not boosted by homologous vaccination. MVA-specific IFN-γ responses were detected following MVA85A vaccination as we have shown previously <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The detected cellular anti-vector responses were not associated with the vaccine-induced insert-specific responses.</p>
              <p id="p0190">Although the role of antibodies in control of TB is unclear, some studies have demonstrated a crucial role of antibodies in protection against infection and we have demonstrated that vaccine-induced Ag85A-specific IgG is associated with a reduced risk of TB disease <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Here, we show that vaccination with ChAdOx1 85A enhances Ag85A-specific IgG responses, which in turn are boosted by MVA85A. IgG antibodies to the vectors were detected following vaccination; however no association between anti-vector and anti-Ag85A IgG responses is evident.</p>
              <p id="p0195">Whilst it is likely that more than one antigen is needed in a subunit vaccine for protection in genetically diverse human populations, this experimental medicine study demonstrates proof-of-concept of a prime-boost approach with a novel simian adenoviral vector prime and an MVA boost in BCG-vaccinated adults. Further work is needed to identify novel antigenic targets for inclusion in a multi-antigenic prime-boost vaccination regimen.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0200">This is the first study of the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 85A in humans. We have shown the vaccine to be well-tolerated when given alone or in combination with MVA85A, and that ChAdOx1 85A induces potent Ag85A specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses which are boosted by MVA85A vaccination.</p>

Groups A and B volunteers received MVA85A (1 × 108 pfu) at D56 and D119 respectively. Figure (I) shows responses to recombinant Ag85A, Figure (II) shows ChAdOx1-specific IgG responses and figure (III) presents anti-MVA IgG responses. Data is presented in Optical Density (OD) measured at 405nm. Individual values are shown for each volunteer. Red dots indicate median values in each group. The Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was used to detect differences between time points in the same group. Significant differences between groups are as follows: *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.</p>
