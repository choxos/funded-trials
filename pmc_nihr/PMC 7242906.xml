                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Dissociative seizures are paroxysmal events resembling epilepsy or syncope with characteristic features that allow them to be distinguished from other medical conditions. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) plus standardised medical care with standardised medical care alone for the reduction of dissociative seizure frequency.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this pragmatic, parallel-arm, multicentre randomised controlled trial, we initially recruited participants at 27 neurology or epilepsy services in England, Scotland, and Wales. Adults (≥18 years) who had dissociative seizures in the previous 8 weeks and no epileptic seizures in the previous 12 months were subsequently randomly assigned (1:1) from 17 liaison or neuropsychiatry services following psychiatric assessment, to receive standardised medical care or CBT plus standardised medical care, using a web-based system. Randomisation was stratified by neuropsychiatry or liaison psychiatry recruitment site. The trial manager, chief investigator, all treating clinicians, and patients were aware of treatment allocation, but outcome data collectors and trial statisticians were unaware of treatment allocation. Patients were followed up 6 months and 12 months after randomisation. The primary outcome was monthly dissociative seizure frequency (ie, frequency in the previous 4 weeks) assessed at 12 months. Secondary outcomes assessed at 12 months were: seizure severity (intensity) and bothersomeness; longest period of seizure freedom in the previous 6 months; complete seizure freedom in the previous 3 months; a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency relative to baseline; changes in dissociative seizures (rated by others); health-related quality of life; psychosocial functioning; psychiatric symptoms, psychological distress, and somatic symptom burden; and clinical impression of improvement and satisfaction. p values and statistical significance for outcomes were reported without correction for multiple comparisons as per our protocol. Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat population with multiple imputation for missing observations. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, ISRCTN05681227, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02325544" id="interrefs20">NCT02325544</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Jan 16, 2015, and May 31, 2017, we randomly assigned 368 patients to receive CBT plus standardised medical care (n=186) or standardised medical care alone (n=182); of whom 313 had primary outcome data at 12 months (156 [84%] of 186 patients in the CBT plus standardised medical care group and 157 [86%] of 182 patients in the standardised medical care group). At 12 months, no significant difference in monthly dissociative seizure frequency was identified between the groups (median 4 seizures [IQR 0–20] in the CBT plus standardised medical care group <italic>vs</italic> 7 seizures [1–35] in the standardised medical care group; estimated incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·78 [95% CI 0·56–1·09]; p=0·144). Dissociative seizures were rated as less bothersome in the CBT plus standardised medical care group than the standardised medical care group (estimated mean difference −0·53 [95% CI −0·97 to −0·08]; p=0·020). The CBT plus standardised medical care group had a longer period of dissociative seizure freedom in the previous 6 months (estimated IRR 1·64 [95% CI 1·22 to 2·20]; p=0·001), reported better health-related quality of life on the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Level Health Today visual analogue scale (estimated mean difference 6·16 [95% CI 1·48 to 10·84]; p=0·010), less impairment in psychosocial functioning on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (estimated mean difference −4·12 [95% CI −6·35 to −1·89]; p&lt;0·001), less overall psychological distress than the standardised medical care group on the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10 scale (estimated mean difference −1·65 [95% CI −2·96 to −0·35]; p=0·013), and fewer somatic symptoms on the modified Patient Health Questionnaire-15 scale (estimated mean difference −1·67 [95% CI −2·90 to −0·44]; p=0·008). Clinical improvement at 12 months was greater in the CBT plus standardised medical care group than the standardised medical care alone group as reported by patients (estimated mean difference 0·66 [95% CI 0·26 to 1·04]; p=0·001) and by clinicians (estimated mean difference 0·47 [95% CI 0·21 to 0·73]; p&lt;0·001), and the CBT plus standardised medical care group had greater satisfaction with treatment than did the standardised medical care group (estimated mean difference 0·90 [95% CI 0·48 to 1·31]; p&lt;0·001). No significant differences in patient-reported seizure severity (estimated mean difference −0·11 [95% CI −0·50 to 0·29]; p=0·593) or seizure freedom in the last 3 months of the study (estimated odds ratio [OR] 1·77 [95% CI 0·93 to 3·37]; p=0·083) were identified between the groups. Furthermore, no significant differences were identified in the proportion of patients who had a more than 50% reduction in dissociative seizure frequency compared with baseline (OR 1·27 [95% CI 0·80 to 2·02]; p=0·313). Additionally, the 12-item Short Form survey–version 2 scores (estimated mean difference for the Physical Component Summary score 1·78 [95% CI −0·37 to 3·92]; p=0·105; estimated mean difference for the Mental Component Summary score 2·22 [95% CI −0·30 to 4·75]; p=0·084), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scale score (estimated mean difference −1·09 [95% CI −2·27 to 0·09]; p=0·069), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale depression score (estimated mean difference −1·10 [95% CI −2·41 to 0·21]; p=0·099) did not differ significantly between groups. Changes in dissociative seizures (rated by others) could not be assessed due to insufficient data. During the 12-month period, the number of adverse events was similar between the groups: 57 (31%) of 186 participants in the CBT plus standardised medical care group reported 97 adverse events and 53 (29%) of 182 participants in the standardised medical care group reported 79 adverse events.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>CBT plus standardised medical care had no statistically significant advantage compared with standardised medical care alone for the reduction of monthly seizures. However, improvements were observed in a number of clinically relevant secondary outcomes following CBT plus standardised medical care when compared with standardised medical care alone. Thus, adults with dissociative seizures might benefit from the addition of dissociative seizure-specific CBT to specialist care from neurologists and psychiatrists.

              <p id="para10">Dissociative seizures are paroxysmal episodes of altered awareness, resembling epileptic seizures or syncope, which are not explained by these or other medical disorders and usually have distinctive clinical features.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Between 12% and 20% of adults presenting in epilepsy clinics have dissociative seizures.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Prevalence estimates range between 2 and 50 cases per 100 000 individuals;<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> a UK-based study observed an annual incidence of around 4·9 cases per 100 000 individuals.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> We have adopted the term dissociative seizures in preference to others (eg, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, non-epileptic attack disorder) because it is consistent with widely used classifications (ie, ICD-10),<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> highlights that the diagnosis is not solely a process of exclusion, and conveys a mechanism that can be discussed with patients.</p>
              <p id="para20">Around 75% of adults with dissociative seizures are women.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Modal onset of dissociative seizures is between the late teenage years and early twenties, but dissociative seizures can develop at any point across the lifespan.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Most adults with dissociative seizures present with a range of comorbid psychiatric and psychological difficulties.

              <p id="para30">The most consistent predictive factor of poor outcome for people with dissociative seizures seems to be the duration of symptoms, whereby a longer duration of the disorder is associated with negative outcomes.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Additional factors that negatively predict outcomes include the receipt of state financial benefits,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> having previous psychiatric diagnoses,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and other evidence of psychopathology<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and interpersonal difficulties.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Employment,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> better educational attainment and intelligence quotient,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and less evidence of somatisation<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> have been found to predict better outcome.</p>
              <p id="para40">In the UK, no standardised care pathway exists for people with dissociative seizures. Although psychological treatment has been considered the treatment of choice, the availability of such treatment is variable,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> despite guidance<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> that when dissociative seizures are suspected, referral should be made to psychiatric or psychological services for evaluation and intervention.</p>
              <p id="para50">Psychological interventions might be associated with a reduction in dissociative seizures,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> although seizures might also remit spontaneously<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> or after information provision.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> However, no adequately powered randomised controlled trials have been done to assess the use of psychotherapeutic treatments.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A small, four-arm pilot randomised controlled trial in 34 patients<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> evaluated outcome in terms of dissociative seizure frequency and a range of secondary outcomes following 12 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-informed psychotherapy with or without flexible-dose sertraline, sertraline alone, or treatment as usual. Within-group analyses showed that both CBT-informed psychothotherapy groups had a significant reduction in dissociative seizure frequency during the treatment period (CBT-informed psychothotherapy (n=9) 51·4% reduction, p=0·01; CBT-informed psychothotherapy plus sertraline (n=9) 59·3% reduction, p=0·008) over 16 weeks, and improvement in a range of secondary outcomes, including global functioning. No significant differences in dissociative seizure frequency were identified in the sertraline-alone group (n=9; p=0·08) or the treatment as usual group (n=7; p=0·19). Our 2010 proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> including 66 patients indicated that dissociative seizure-specific CBT plus neuropsychiatric care could lead to a reduction in dissociative seizure frequency at the end of treatment compared with neuropsychiatric treatment alone; however, between-group differences were not significant 6 months after the end of treatment. These findings informed the design of this randomised controlled trial. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of dissociative seizure-specific CBT in reducing the frequency of dissociative seizures and improving functioning compared with standardised medical care after 12 months of follow-up.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">For patients with dissociative seizures, the general consensus is that careful explanation of the diagnosis followed by psychotherapy is the treatment of choice, although to date, no standardised treatment pathways have been established globally. A 2014 Cochrane review highlighted the paucity of adequate randomised controlled trials in this field. Existing studies were small or did not include dissociative seizure occurrence as an outcome. The best evidence was considered to be from a 2010 pilot randomised controlled trial study, which evaluated the benefit of dissociative seizure-specific cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for adults with dissociative seizures plus standard medical (neuropsychiatric) care, compared with standard medical care alone. That proof-of-concept study, which followed on from an uncontrolled study and a single case study, indicated that a dissociative seizure-specific CBT package plus standard medical care led to a greater reduction in dissociative seizures at the end of treatment than did standard care alone, although at 6-month follow-up, the between-group difference was non-significant.</p>
                  <p id="para90">We searched PubMed from database inception to Oct 16, 2019, without language restrictions, using the search terms “([therapy and dissociative seizures)]” OR “([CBT and dissociative seizures])” OR “([therapy and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures])” OR “([CBT and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures])” OR “([therapy and PNES])” OR “([CBT and PNES])” OR “([therapy and nonepileptic attack disorder])” OR “([CBT and nonepileptic attack disorder])” OR “([therapy and NEAD])” OR “([CBT and NEAD])”. Our search yielded one additional underpowered pilot randomised controlled trial that assessed CBT-informed psychotherapy alone, CBT-informed psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and treatment as usual, but no adequately powered multi-site effectiveness studies.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para110">Our study compared standardised medical care alone with dissociative seizure-specific CBT plus standardised medical care. Standardised medical care aimed to provide an optimised clinical pathway involving neurologists and psychiatrists with standardised communication guidelines and materials. Our randomised controlled trial of adults with dissociative seizures is the largest to date to assess a psychological intervention in this patient group. Although no statistically significant difference in dissociative seizure frequency at 12 months was identified between the CBT plus standardised medical care and standardised medical care alone groups, significant improvements were identified for a number of clinically relevant secondary outcomes (highest number of consecutive dissociative seizure-free days in the past 6 months, functional status, self-rated and clinician-rated change in global impression scores, and satisfaction with treatment) among the CBT plus standardised medical care group when compared with the standardised medical care alone group. This pragmatic study shows that although dissociative seizure-specific CBT did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the primary outcome of monthly dissociative seizures when compared with standardised medical care, the combined treatment approach might improve a number of relevant clinical outcome measures.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para130">Although no significant difference in monthly dissociative seizure frequency was identified between the treatment groups, this study expands on previous evidence suggesting that CBT specific to dissociative seizures might be beneficial for adults with dissociative seizures and demonstrates that the application of such an intervention does not have to be limited to highly specialised centres. The additional implementation of dissociative seizure-specific, manualised, and individualised CBT can be delivered by clinical psychologists or cognitive behavioural psychotherapists. Therapy resulted in improvements in a range of dissociative seizure-related and psychosocial secondary outcomes in the CBT plus standardised medical care group compared with standardised medical care alone.</p>

                <p id="para140">In this pragmatic, parallel-group, multicentre randomised controlled trial, we initially recruited participants from 27 neurology or epilepsy services in England, Scotland, and Wales. Eligible participants were adults (≥18 years) who had dissociative seizures in the previous 8 weeks (diagnosis preferably confirmed by video-electroencephalogram [EEG] or, if not available, clinical consensus provided by two consultants involved in the patient's care or by expert review of the clinical records and relevant investigations by one of two neurologists in the research team), without a documented history of intellectual disabilities, who were able to complete seizure diaries and questionnaires, and were willing to have a psychiatric assessment at 3 months after diagnosis.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Due to the uncertainty of being able to provide interpreters for CBT sessions, only patients with sufficient English proficiency to enable completion of therapy and questionnaires without an interpreter were included. Patients with comorbid epilepsy could only participate if they had been free of epileptic seizures for 12 months, and patients who met DSM-IV criteria for current drug or alcohol dependence were excluded. Around 3 months after enrolment and consent for the initial screening phase of the study was obtained, participants were assessed in one of 17 neuropsychiatry or liaison psychiatry services. The 3-month delay was implemented to avoid recruitment of patients whose dissociative seizures might remit quickly after delivery of a diagnosis and information provision alone<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and to allow time for appointments to be arranged. Participants who met further eligibility criteria<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and provided consent were recruited. The main approved modification implemented after publication of the study protocol and analysis plan was to extend the number of participants screened in the neurology and epilepsy settings and numbers randomly assigned to ensure adequate participants at follow-up. The study was approved by the London-Camberwell St Giles Research Ethics Committee. The study protocol and statistical analysis plan have been published previously.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> All participants provided separate written informed consent for the 3-month observation period and the randomised controlled trial.</p>

After patient consent was obtained for the 3-month observation period, we collected demographic information, study participants were instructed in seizure diary completion, and seizure data were collected every 2 weeks by a researcher. The neurologist who had explained the dissociative seizures diagnosis referred the participant to a psychiatrist in a specified National Health Service (NHS) clinic for an appointment around 3 months later. At this appointment, the psychiatrist reviewed the diagnosis and discussed it with the patient using suggested <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.codestrial.org/information-booklets/4579871164" id="interrefs40">guidelines</ext-link>, did a clinical psychiatric assessment, provided the patient with a further psychiatry trial-specific information booklet, and assessed the patient's eligibility for the randomised controlled trial. Eligible patients who were willing to be contacted about the trial were seen by a researcher who confirmed eligibility, obtained consent to participate in the randomised controlled trial, and did baseline assessments before randomisation. The interventions are described in detail in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 4–7)</xref> and have been published previously.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para170">To assess the fidelity of CBT delivery, after obtaining patient consent we audio-recorded therapy sessions. Two experienced CBT therapists who had not provided therapy in the trial blindly rated one session (chosen at random from one of two preselected sessions) from each of 36 therapists for whom we had usable session recordings (39 therapists overall). The raters evaluated therapists' adherence to the treatment manual, whether they could be considered to be delivering CBT, the quality of the therapeutic alliance, and the extent to which dissociative seizure-specific CBT skills were used in sessions, on the basis of identified competencies.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Items were scored on a 0–7 scale.

                <p id="para210">Secondary outcomes assessed at 12 months were seizure severity (intensity) and bothersomeness measured using the Seizure Severity Scale; longest period of seizure freedom in the previous 6 months; the proportion of patients with complete seizure freedom during the final 3 months of the study; the proportion of patients who had more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency relative to baseline; informants' (ie, carers or others nominated by patients) ratings of changes in the patients' dissociative seizures; health-related quality of life (12-item Short Form 12 Survey–version 2 [SF-12v2] scores comprising Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores; and the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale); psychosocial functioning (Work and Social Adjustment Scale [WSAS]); psychiatric symptoms and psychological distress (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9 depression measure, Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10 [CORE-10]); somatic symptom burden (modified PHQ-15,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> which measured self-reported presence or absence of 30 symptoms [15 common symptoms seen in primary care, ten neurological symptoms, and five psychological symptoms]); and clinical impression of improvement (Clinical Global Impression score [rated by the patient and by the psychiatrist or neurologist]) and satisfaction with treatment.

First, agreement between the two different methods of recording the primary outcome (diary or questionnaire item) was assessed by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient on the log scale, and the sensitivity of the finding to the recording method was assessed by repeating the multiple imputation analysis after treating patients who did not provide the diary measure (considered the gold standard) as missing. Second, all 17 outcomes were re-analysed on a complete case basis (ie, without imputation or adjustment for baseline predictors of missingness). To assess the efficacy of CBT in the presence of non-compliance, the complier average causal effect (CACE) was estimated for the primary outcome; log-transformed seizure frequency was considered the dependent variable and treatment receipt as the explanatory variable and its effect estimated by a two-stage least squares estimator.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para450">To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised controlled trial that has been done to date, assessing a psychotherapeutic intervention for adults with dissociative seizures, in the context of a care pathway involving both neurology and psychiatry services. Our analysis showed that at 12 months after randomisation no significant differences in dissociative seizure frequency were observed between the CBT plus standardised medical care and standardised medical care groups. For nine of 16 secondary outcome measures, between-group differences were significant at the unadjusted 5% level (p≤0·05). These data suggest that compared with standardised medical care alone, CBT plus standardised medical care provided particular benefits with regard to the longest period of seizure freedom at 12 months, psychosocial functioning, self-rated and clinician-rated global change, and treatment satisfaction and all showed standardised group differences in the moderate range. Treatment compliance among patients in the intervention group was high (75%) and therapists showed good adherence to the therapy manual, and were found to be delivering CBT as intended.</p>
              <p id="para460">By contrast with our earlier study,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> this trial suggests that dissociative seizure-specific CBT could contribute to improvement in clinically important aspects of psychosocial functioning and perceptions of health among patients with dissociative seizures. These improvements were observed despite the observation that at baseline more than half of the cohort self-reported maladaptive personality traits, more than two-thirds had at least one other comorbid mental health disorder, and participants did not enter the study until dissociative seizures had already been present for a median of 3 years. Before treatment, the cohort also had below average health-related quality-of-life scores on the SF-12v2.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Patients also reported mean scores on the WSAS consistent with at least moderately severe functional impairment when summarising across the domains of work, home management, social and private leisure activities, and the ability to form and maintain interpersonal relationships.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Furthermore, self-rated health on the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale was scored considerably below the national average.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Increasing evidence suggests that seizure frequency alone is not the most important determinant of quality of life in patients with dissociative seizures. A 2017 study<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> found that mood, anxiety, and illness perceptions were the factors most closely linked with quality of life in patients with dissociative seizures, emphasising the importance of the secondary outcome effects in this trial. These effects are particularly notable since therapists might have faced additional challenges because patients were not preselected by therapists for their suitability for a cognitive behavioural intervention, which might be the case in routine service delivery.</p>
              <p id="para470">A wider issue raised in this study is that of best practice for treatment trials of dissociative seizures. This study followed a standard clinical trial approach of offering a specific intervention to a patient group and measuring outcomes. However, particular subgroups of patients might be more likely to respond to a CBT-based treatment, and others more likely to respond to other psychotherapeutic or pharmacological interventions. This idea is commonly applied in clinical practice—eg, a specific patient might be deemed unlikely to engage meaningfully with a psychotherapeutic intervention, even if that intervention is generally regarded as a treatment of choice for the condition in question. These are judgements that rely on clinical impression but to base such decisions on empirical evidence would require formal trials of treatment regimens tailored to subgroups of patients. Similar comments could be made regarding treatment studies of many other conditions, particularly those that involve a complex interplay of psychological and physical factors that might vary considerably between individuals, even if their symptoms are similar. However, it might be possible to identify factors that make individuals more likely to respond to particular interventions. This issue is outside the scope of this Article, but we hope to explore it further in subsequent statistical analysis of the impact of moderating and mediating variables on treatment outcomes in this trial, which will be reported separately.</p>
              <p id="para480">Regarding study limitations, we did not include a waiting list or treatment-as-usual control group and, thus, are unable to determine whether the apparent reduction in dissociative seizure frequency observed in both groups at 12 months represents equal effectiveness of the treatment allocations or the natural progression of the disorder in our sample. We are not aware of data on dissociative seizure outcome with no intervention over 12 months with which to compare our findings, although an uncontrolled retrospective study done over a longer period of time, without a psychological intervention, in a different cultural context, suggests that more than 50% of patients with dissociative seizures might become seizure free in the absence of psychotherapy,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> but it is not clear how quickly such improvement occurs. The control condition in this study might have been an active therapeutic intervention and, with the materials provided for patients and guidance given to clinicians about diagnosis delivery and management, might be better conceptualised as standardised specialist care than standardised medical care (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 82</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para490">Regarding other study limitations, our randomised controlled trial included a cohort who were selected using several inclusion criteria. Only individuals who were initially recruited after diagnosis by neurologists or epilepsy specialists and attended their psychiatric assessment could enrol. We excluded people with active epilepsy (ie, epileptic seizures in the previous 12 months) but acknowledge that where we relied on self-report for this criterion, this could potentially have led to the inclusion of some people with active seizures<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> despite careful consensus review and the possibility of further review at the time of the psychiatric assessment. We restricted our sample to people without documented intellectual disabilities and without concurrent comorbid epileptic seizures to make evaluation of the individualised CBT more interpretable. Due to the uncertainty of being able to provide interpreters, only patients with sufficient English proficiency to enable completion of therapy and questionnaires without an interpreter were included. Consistent with usual clinical practice in the UK, diagnoses of dissociative seizures in our sample were supported by video-EEG recordings of typical dissociative seizure events in about half of all participants.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In line with previous international expert recommendations,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> and to ensure that the findings of the study were more readily generalisable to routine UK practice, we also sought to include patients for whom diagnosis had been reached without video-EEG confirmation. The risk of misdiagnosis, if clinical consensus had not already been obtained, was reduced in these cases by seeking expert review of the clinical records and relevant investigations and exclusion of patients with questionable diagnoses, although we did not classify levels of diagnostic certainty.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Video-EEG confirmation was not compulsory in this pragmatic trial since this diagnostic method is not available or cost-effective for many in routine clinical use, and treatment might be appropriately started at less than optimum levels of diagnostic certainty.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para500">Although randomisation would be expected to have led to similar baseline levels of psychotropic medication use in the two trial groups, we did not record the prescription of antidepressant and other psychotropic medication in the two treatment groups and cannot be sure that the standardised medical care alone group did not receive more of this type of treatment as a substitute for psychotherapeutic input than the CBT plus standardised medical care group; this is unfortunate considering the interest in the use of antidepressants for dissociative seizures either alone or in combination with CBT-informed psychotherapy.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para510">Both groups were contacted frequently by researchers and were required to complete seizure diaries throughout the study, which might have acted as an intervention, not typically available in the NHS. Both patients and their treating doctors were aware of treatment allocation. Although doctors might have altered their practice depending on treatment allocation, patients received a similar number of standardised medical care sessions in the two groups. We did not, however, control for therapist time and attention. Although many patients will have come to the study with trauma histories, and the CBT intervention did address trauma, this was not specifically a trauma-focused therapy. We acknowledge that at the end of the study additional therapy might have been considered useful for some.</p>
              <p id="para520">Although dissociative seizure frequency was our primary outcome, the usefulness of this as an outcome has been questioned.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Recording this outcome consistently in a large sample poses difficulties (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 75–76</xref>). Functional status might be a more meaningful outcome, especially if it occurs in the context of better ability to tolerate persistent dissociative seizures, enabling better everyday activity. We also note that it is unfortunate that non-adherence with CBT was predictive of missing outcome data but, wherever possible, unless individuals formally withdrew from the trial, we encouraged follow-up irrespective of treatment experience, but we could not insist that people provide outcome data when they discontinued attending CBT; however, the proportion of patients who provided outcome data was balanced between treatment groups.</p>
              <p id="para530">The strengths of this study include the pragmatic design, large sample size, high follow-up rates, outcome assessments (other than clinician ratings) done by a masked researcher, and the large number of centres and therapists involved, which removed potential bias occurring in smaller study designs. The good compliance with CBT suggests that this approach would be acceptable for implementation in routine clinical use with appropriate training and supervision. During the 12 month follow-up period, no differences in adverse events or serious adverse events or other harms were identified between the CBT plus standardised medical care and standardised medical care groups.</p>
              <p id="para540">In conclusion, our model of CBT was not shown to confer a benefit for dissociative seizure frequency at 12 months when combined with specialist medical care involving careful explanation of the diagnosis and psychiatric care. Dissociative seizure-specific CBT was, however, associated with improvements in other secondary clinical outcome measures including psychosocial functioning, and our results indicate that dissociative seizure-specific CBT can be delivered safely to a wide range of patients with dissociative seizures.</p>
