                  <p id="Par1">Increasing attendances by children (aged 0–16 years) to United Kingdom Emergency Departments (EDs) challenges patient safety within the National Health Service (NHS) with health professionals required to make complex judgements on whether children attending urgent and emergency care services can be sent home safely or require admission. Health regulation bodies have recommended that an early identification systems should be developed to recognise children developing critical illnesses. The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust Paediatric Observation Priority Score (PAT-POPS) was developed as an ED-specific tool for this purpose. This study aims to revise and improve the existing tool and determine its utility in determining safe admission and discharge decision making.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">An observational study to improve diagnostic accuracy using data from children and young people attending the ED and Urgent Care Centre (UCC) at three hospitals over a 12 month period. The data being collected is part of routine practice; therefore opt-out methods of consent will be used. The reference standard is admission or discharge. A revised PAT-POPs scoring tool will be developed using clinically guided logistic regression models to explore which components best predict hospital admission and safe discharge. Suitable cut-points for safe admission and discharge will be established using sensitivity and specificity as judged by an expert consensus meeting. The diagnostic accuracy of the revised tool will be assessed, and it will be compared to the former version of PAT-POPS using ROC analysis.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par21">In 2016–2017 4.49 million children aged under 16 years of age attended United Kingdom (UK) Emergency Departments (EDs), up from 4.36 million in the previous year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current trends continue to demonstrate increasing attendances across a range of conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This use of urgent and emergency care facilities puts pressure on the National Health Service (NHS) to balance public demand for high quality services and maintain commissioner and productivity agendas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Ultimately healthcare professionals make judgements on whether children attending EDs can be sent home safely or require admission to a hospital ward or admission to an observation and assessment area. These judgements require a complex assessment of the child’s health and an estimation of the potential for improvement or deterioration. The majority of parents seeking advice for sick children need only reassurance and minimal intervention as there is fortunately a low incidence of serious illness in the UK. However, amongst those presenting each year there are some particularly sick children and young people, and detection requires health care professionals to have skills in recognising them. The National Patient Safety Agency (a predecessor of the NHS Commissioning Board Special Health Authority) and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence supported the conclusions of The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Childhood Health (CEMACH) report “Why Children Die: a pilot study (2006)” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] which highlighted death may be prevented if clinicians were better at recognising deterioration. The report recommended that early identification systems to recognise children developing critical illness should be used as the UK continues to perform poorly against other European countries in relation to childhood mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] calls to introduce these nationally have continued.</p>
              <p id="Par22">A single early warning system is unlikely to perform well across all areas of care, as monitoring a child over a period of time on a hospital ward for the development of worsening illness is different to assessing a child in a relatively short space of time in the ED. There is a need for a specific ED early warning system, validated on ED patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">A recent review of the use of nine paediatric early warning scores in EDs determined they were of only poor-moderate use in the prediction of admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This study did not examine the safety profile of the scores or whether they could be used to assist in supporting safe discharge decisions. A risk-averse strategy of referring all children of ‘potential concern’ to inpatient paediatric services overloads an already stretched system and leads to unnecessary hospital admissions. These unnecessary admissions are not welcomed by children, families or carers and may cause concern to be expressed by commissioners and financial controllers. There are a limited number of studies on the use of specific scoring systems in children’s EDs and other urgent care settings. For example, a study in 2008 of less than 400 patients demonstrated low sensitivity in predicting the need for admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust Paediatric Observation Priority Score (PAT-POPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] is a modified version of the Paediatric Observation Priority Score (POPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. POPS was developed as a bespoke ED specific method of identifying children with potentially serious illnesses or infections while at the same time safely supporting staff in redirecting or discharging those who do not need ongoing immediate care. In other words, sick children can be clearly identified early in the patient journey, and conversely, there is an objective measurement to help staff avoid unnecessary burdening of hospital paediatric services for well children. The initial POPS study demonstrated an increased relative risk of admission with a POPS &gt; 2, and demonstrated the utility of its novel nurse “gut feeling” (judgement) component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Further data on over 20,000 patients has demonstrated a relationship between length of stay and increasing POPS score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. POPS has been shown to be beneficial in defining appropriate admission and also effective in defining safe discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">PAT-POPS contains clinical variables includes heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and also some comments on the appearance of the child (such as work of breathing and level of alertness). Each of the variables is assigned a score between 0 and 2 (i.e. a normal heart rate for the child’s age would score 0; a very high rate would score 2). Nine variables are considered, leading to a score between 0 and 18. Initial study of PAT-POPS showed reasonable sensitivity and specificity of admission prediction (Receiver Operating Characteristic of 0.72 with 95% CI 0.68 to 0.75) compared to other similar tools but probably less than would be clinical acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is no direct adult equivalent tool as current systems often employ more uncomfortable (e.g. Blood Pressure) or invasive investigations (e.g. blood tests) which would not be suitable in large populations of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Improving the performance of PAT-POPS could have the following impact in urgent and emergency care settings.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par25">Identifying those children and young people that need to be admitted and are more likely to be sicker than those who can be discharged will have beneficial effects on patients as they can be identified more quickly and more reliably, and prioritised for urgent, senior medical care. PAT-POPS ought to improve time to recognition especially in critical conditions like sepsis which can be difficult to recognise.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">Those children who are sick enough to need inpatient treatment must be able to access it rapidly; conversely well children ought not to be in hospital where they are being taken away from their normal social and family arena. The PAT-POPS tool ought to be able to identify well children and young people that are well enough to be referred back to primary care or self-care at home, as well as to identify those children and young people who require a full assessment and admission. This will not only have beneficial effects on both groups of children but will also lead to service efficiency without jeopardising patient safety.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par27">The overall aim of this project is to revise the PAT-POPS assessment tool to aid discharge and admission decision-making in relation to children and young people in hospital urgent and emergency care facilities, and thereby improve the quality of care that patients receive.

The data being collected from patients is the same as that routinely collected from patients who attend EDs at the current time – it is non-invasive physiological data combined with a subjective assessment of how unwell the patient is. Both of these types of data are routinely collected in EDs throughout the UK and the only difference in this study is that we will capture data on all patients attending during the time period of the study – including those with very minor conditions who, perhaps, would not have had non-invasive physiological measurements taken in some emergency departments. The study will take place over a whole year (February 2018 to January 2019) as inclusion of data from those attending during autumn, winter, summer and spring periods the study will avoid the effects of bias from seasonal variability (e.g. greater incidence of respiratory conditions during the winter months).</p>

                  <p id="Par45">The reference standard should be the best possible method of determining the outcome and should be objective rather than subjective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An objective decision on whether to admit a child or young person to inpatient care is problematic as there is no existing gold standard outcome measure for the decision to admit or discharge a child or young person from the ED. The decision to admit children and young people is a complex decision, which can vary between clinicians and hospitals.</p>
                  <p id="Par46">We will define a patient as being admitted to hospital if they leave the ED to enter the hospital, (including observation and assessment unit or hospital ward), either on first presentation or with the same complaint within seven days of first presentation. This correlates well with the thoughts of the PPI group, which saw admission and discharge in such terms, more clearly than did the research group. This reference standard has been adopted after direct discussion with members of the public involved in our project and with three ED doctors who have reviewed a draft of this proposal. The decision to admit the patient will be made by a clinician (either a doctor or a nurse practitioner). They will follow existing guidelines, using usual methods of clinical judgement, and will be blinded to the PAT-POPS database and the final PAT-POPS score. Admission data from all the hospitals in the Trust will be accessed from the existing NHS Trust electronic systems.</p>

Other screening tools for use in EDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] include other non-invasive variables which might improve the diagnostic accuracy of PAT-POPS. Therefore in addition to the current PAT-POPSv1, the following additional variables: arrival by ambulance; day of the week; time of the day; referral by health professional; attendance with same problem in previous week will be collected. The full list of variables to be collected is available as in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. All of the potential assessment items for the PAT-POPS v2 tool will be collected from each child. Data will be collected at triage by existing clinical staff as a routine part of practice, and entered into the existing IT systems used at the study sites (Symphony and PAS). Data will be stored securely in the Symphony and PAS systems and exported to a purpose-designed database every three months. Data will be collected on all eligible patients who attend the ED/UCC thereby ensuring data is collected throughout the twenty-four hour period and throughout all days of the week.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study variables</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Variable</th><th>Variable Type</th><th>Values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="5">Category of variable</td><td>Site ID</td><td>number</td><td>1 2 3 ….</td></tr><tr><td>Participant ID</td><td>number</td><td>Start with site ID eg 100001, 100002… 200001, 200002 …</td></tr><tr><td>Eligible for the study</td><td>binary</td><td>Y/N [if any of the ineligibility reasons selected this defaults to N]</td></tr><tr><td>Ineligibility reason</td><td>nominal</td><td>Dead on arrival;<break/>Arrived in cardio-respiratory arrest.</td></tr><tr><td>Date of arrival</td><td>date</td><td/></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Patient characteristics</td><td>Gender</td><td>nominal</td><td>Male/female</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>nominal</td><td>African<break/>Any other Asian Background<break/>Any other Black Background<break/>Any other Ethnic Group<break/>Any other Mixed Background<break/>Any other White Background<break/>Bangladeshi<break/>British<break/>Caribbean<break/>Chinese<break/>Indian<break/>Irish<break/>Not Stated<break/>Pakistani<break/>White &amp; Asian<break/>White &amp; Black African<break/>White &amp; Black Caribbean</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="20">PAT-POPs existing variables:</td><td>Date of birth</td><td>date</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Heart rate</td><td>number</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Temperature</td><td>number</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Respiratory rate</td><td>number</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Oxygen saturation (%)</td><td>number</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Does this patient require supplemental oxygen to maintain appropriate oxygen saturation levels?</td><td>binary</td><td>Y/N</td></tr><tr><td>Breathing – wheeze</td><td>binary</td><td>Y/N</td></tr><tr><td>Breathing – stridor</td><td>binary</td><td>Y/N</td></tr><tr><td>Breathing – audible grunt</td><td>binary</td><td>Y/N</td></tr><tr><td>Breathing – tracheal tug</td><td>binary</td><td>Y/N</td></tr><tr><td>Other Respiratory Distress apart from wheeze, stridor, audible grunt or tracheal tug.</td><td>binary</td><td>Y/N</td></tr><tr><td>Select one of the following four (no further selections available once one has been selected)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> 1.

                  <p id="Par49">The training dataset will be used to undertake clinically guided stepwise model building, using logistic regression modelling. A suitable approach to sample size estimation for building logistic regression models is to include 20 cases requiring hospital admission for each level of freedom of each variable that is being considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The variables that will be considered for inclusion in the modelling number 22 in total (see Table 1 for a full list). The POPS variables are currently calculated as categorical variables with 3 categories (0, 1 or 2), so we have assumed in the sample size estimation that all 22 variables will be measured at 2 levels. The actual cut-points of individual variables will be determined through a statistical examination of the variables with clinical opinion if the values are not valid in practice. The admission rate will vary across hospitals: we have looked at the admission rates of 3 hospitals 2010–14 and find a mean admission rate of 13%. (20 cases × 22 variables × 2 levels per variable)/0.13 = 6770 children. When undertaking the modelling, it would be helpful to consider seasonality, and examine differences between sub-groups of children, including whether they arrive with trauma or a medical complaints. To avoid overfitting the models we will therefore require a minimum of around 9000 children for the training dataset.</p>

This method first estimates the expected sensitivity and specificity at the chosen cut-point of the POPS screening test. It also calculates the number of cases that are required to estimate the sensitivity and specificity to within a specified 95% confidence interval. This provides the number of cases, which then is divided by the admission rate, to estimate the total sample of children needed for the study. We conservatively estimate the expected sensitivity and specificity of PAT-POPS v3 at 0.75; we set the 95% confidence interval at 0.7 to 0.8; and assume an admission rate of 0.13 (as before). To estimate an expected sensitivity and specificity of 0.75, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.7 to 0.8, 869 admitted cases are required (using tables provided in Flahault et al.). Assuming the admission rate will be 0.13, we will need to recruit 869/0.13 = 6685 children for the validation data set.</p>

We will compare the sensitivity and specificity of PAT-POPS v1 and PAT-POPS v2 to predict admission or discharge using the DeLong method to compare ROC curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and reporting the sensitivity and specificity at the chosen cut-points.</p>

                <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
                <p>Prospective informed consent cannot be sought in the PAT-POPS study as:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par77">There is insufficient time to obtain informed consent within the therapeutic window when following standard care</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par78">There is low risk associated with data collection, which is part of routine practice</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par79">Parents may not be present, and even present they are likely to be distressed upon arrival at the ED/UCC</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p>Consent for participation is therefore by opt-out in line with applicable regulatory requirements, ethical principles and guidance on consent in emergency care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The use of opt-out in PAT-POPS was supported by parents who took part in study feasibility work – they felt it was appropriate to provide parents with the participant information sheet following triage, at which point they will have clinical assurance.</p>
                <p>The participant is provided with the information sheet by the triage nurse. The participant information sheet includes general information (including details of how to opt-out overleaf) on PAT-POPS. The participant is informed that the study is reviewing routine clinical information (such as heart rate, temperature and breathing rate) and that this information will be entered in a secure database. All participants are asked to read and review the document and are provided with the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the study. Participants are given one month to complete the opt-out form, otherwise the data will be included the analysis – this information is reiterated in the posters, which is displayed at the ED/UCC.</p>
                <p>Contact details of the Research Project Manager and the Principal Investigator are provided on the participant information sheet and poster, should participants have further questions. Contact details of the Patient Advice and Liaison Service are also provided, if participants remain unhappy.</p>
                <p>The study protocol and participant information sheet have been approved by the REC, HRA and the sponsor.</p>
