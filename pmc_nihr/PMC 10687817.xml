                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The Active Connected Engaged [ACE] study is a multi-centre, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial [RCT] with an internal pilot phase. The ACE study incorporates a multi-level mixed methods process evaluation including a systems mapping approach and an economic evaluation. ACE aims to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a peer-volunteer led active ageing intervention designed to support older adults at risk of mobility disability to become more physically and socially active within their communities and to reduce or reverse, the progression of functional limitations associated with ageing.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Community-dwelling, older adults aged 65 years and older (<italic>n</italic> = 515), at risk of mobility disability due to reduced lower limb physical functioning (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score of 4–9 inclusive) will be recruited. Participants will be randomised to receive either a minimal control intervention or ACE, a 6-month programme underpinned by behaviour change theory, whereby peer volunteers are paired with participants and offer them individually tailored support to engage them in local physical and social activities to improve lower limb mobility and increase their physical activity. Outcome data will be collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. The primary outcome analysis (difference in SPPB score at 18 months) will be undertaken blinded to group allocation. Primary comparative analyses will be on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis with due emphasis placed on confidence intervals.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">ACE is the largest, pragmatic, community-based randomised controlled trial in the UK to target this high-risk segment of the older population by mobilising community resources (peer volunteers). A programme that can successfully engage this population in sufficient activity to improve strength, coordination, balance and social connections would have a major impact on sustaining health and independence.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">ACE is also the first study of its kind to conduct a full economic and comprehensive process evaluation of this type of community-based intervention. If effective and cost-effective, the ACE intervention has strong potential to be implemented widely in the UK and elsewhere.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par33">During old age, people gradually transition from independence and adequate physical function to frailty and mobility disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mobility disability, defined as a reduced ability to walk or balance, increases rapidly with age and generates major societal challenges. These include costs for people with mobility limitations such as loss of independence, risk of falls and reduced quality of life; costs to friends/family who provide care, and increased health and social care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Among adults aged over 70, 38% are classed as frail or pre-frail (defined as scoring 9 or less on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Frail or pre-frail older people have a substantially higher risk of major mobility disability (OR = 8.3 (95% CI: 3.3 to 20.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and mortality (HR 2.6 to 5.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] compared with non-frail older adults.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Increasing physical activity can prevent or delay progression of frailty and mobility disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there is a clear trend of declining physical activity over time in people aged over 65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Reasons for this include the lack of a companion to go out with, low confidence to engage with community initiatives, and perceived safety of engaging with activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A recent systematic review of reviews examined interventions that were efficacious or effective in increasing uptake of physical activity in older people (17 studies; <italic>N</italic> = 79,650) and reported barriers to and facilitators of active ageing (9 studies; <italic>N</italic> = 22,413). Access to role models, peer and community support, individual tailoring of interventions, making exercise enjoyable and sociable, and feelings of ownership of interventions were identified as key enablers of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">A 2019 National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) review of UK-based physical activity interventions for older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] identified only two volunteering programmes, a peer-led walking group feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and our Active Connected Engaged [ACE] feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This review highlighted the need for more robust evidence for such approaches ensuring that they incorporate theories of behaviour change; focus on social enablers of exercise; and target people with poor lower limb strength and/or weaker social networks.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Interventions that can successfully increase levels of physical activity and enhance social connections, leading to the delay or prevention of functional decline would have substantial public health value.</p>

                <p id="Par37">The study protocol is presented in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par38">The ACE study is an individually randomised, parallel-group, single-blind RCT with an internal pilot phase, a multi-level (individual and systems level), mixed-methods process evaluation and an economic evaluation. Following identification and recruitment, 515 patients who meet the study inclusion criteria will be randomised to receive either the ACE intervention, delivered over a period of 6 months by peer volunteers, or a minimal control intervention. Participants will be individually randomised to the intervention and control arms in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by site, using a centralised web-based system run by the Cardiff Centre for Trials Research.</p>
                <p id="Par39">The primary objective of the ACE study is to assess the effectiveness of a peer-volunteer led active ageing intervention for reducing the progression of mobility-related functional limitations in older people, who are at high risk of transition from independence to mobility-related disability. Secondary objectives are to compare participants allocated to the ACE programme with the control group in terms of levels of physical activity, psychological functioning and well-being, health-related quality of life, capability, activities of daily living, cognition, social networks and reduced sedentary time, loneliness, pain, falls, fear of falling and utilisation of health and social care.</p>
                <p id="Par40">The internal pilot phase will assess the feasibility of recruitment methods (allowing for some refinement if needed) and confirm adequate participant retention rates in the study, prior to progressing with the main trial (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Primary and secondary outcome data will be collected at baseline, 6, and 18 months. Selected secondary outcomes will also be assessed at 12 months.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The ACE study will be conducted at four UK sites (West Midlands, Greater Manchester, South Wales and Bristol), allowing recruitment of a socio-economically and ethnically diverse sample. At the delivery site in Wales, the study will be known as ACTIF, with the qualifier ‘known in England as ACE’ on documentation. This is to avoid any confusion with the ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) programme in Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p id="Par42">The eligibility criteria are intended to identify sedentary, community-dwelling, older people aged 65 and over with lower limb functional limitations (i.e. at risk of major mobility limitations) but who are still ambulatory, i.e. they can still walk. This will be measured using a battery of objective physical function tests (SPPB) to assess balance, walking speed and the ability to move from a sitting to a standing position. This generates a physical function score from 0 to 12. Older adults with scores of 4–9 (inclusive) out of 12 will be eligible to take part in ACE. This is based on data showing that older adults with SPPB scores of 9 or less have a substantially higher risk of major mobility disability 3 years later (OR = 8.3 (95% CI: 3.3 to 20.67) compared with those with a score of 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

These two overlapping and mutually compatible theoretical frameworks provide the main principles and processes for supporting behaviour change in the ACE intervention. The ACE logic model illustrates how the intervention is theorised to lead to changes in short and longer-term outcomes, and how contextual (including system-level) processes might influence its operation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). These factors are consistent with qualitative feedback obtained from volunteers in the ACE feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par64">The ACE volunteer training is designed to teach volunteers how to use person-centred communication skills to build and sustain the motivation and engagement of the volunteers, through self-efficacy, positive feedback and fulfilment of the volunteer’s needs and expectations. It also includes teaching volunteers to guide participants along an individually tailored “road map” for behaviour change, based on three key stages: getting motivated; making a plan; and supporting behaviour maintenance.</p>
                <p id="Par65">Peer volunteers will attend a one-day training course delivered by ACE researchers. The course was developed and tested in the ACE feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and further refined in the ACE internal pilot in consultation with the Royal Voluntary Service. It will include (i) skills for developing and reinforcing motivation (person-centred counselling for supporting fundamental (SDT-related needs); (ii) how to identify local activity options and develop individually tailored plans based on participants’ needs /preferences; (iii) the need to build lower limb function (strength and balance) and types of exercise /activity associated with this; (iv) solution-focused methods for avoiding /overcoming barriers; and (v) maintenance support techniques. The training programme emphasises that the ACE volunteer’s role is to support the individual in becoming autonomous and responsible for making decisions about physical activity and social engagement within their local communities.</p>

                <p id="Par70">Effect Size: The primary aim is to assess the long-term (18-month) effect of a peer volunteering/physical activity intervention on changes in SPPB scores. A difference of 0.5 points in the SPPB score has been defined as a minimum clinically meaningful change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par71">Using baseline data from 777 adults with the same inclusion criteria as we propose for this study (from our REACT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]), the standard deviation for SPPB scores in this population is 1.56. This is identical to the standard deviation observed for SPPB scores in the US-based LIFE trial (SD = 1.6, <italic>N</italic> = 1635). To detect a difference of 0.5 points in SPPB with 90% power and 5% significance, 206 participants are required per arm. Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up at 18 months [based on a 19% loss to follow-up at 24 months in our REACT study], the total sample size required is 515.</p>
                <p id="Par72">We will recruit a minimum of 130 volunteers (aged 55 + years) to support two intervention participants each. Since the cluster sizes in the intervention arm are minimal (less than two participants to each volunteer on average) we will not inflate the sample size required for clustering at the level of volunteer. However, the analytic strategy will present results from a partial cluster model to assess the small amount of possible clustering in the intervention arm only.</p>

                <p id="Par73">Primary outcome analysis will be undertaken blinded to group allocation and will be on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis with due emphasis placed on confidence intervals. Using appropriate descriptive statistics we will assess any imbalance between the trial arms at baseline and describe the characteristics of participants. The primary analytic strategy will employ a linear mixed model including baseline, 6- and 18-month SPPB outcome time points as well as the randomisation stratification variable (site). Treatment and time variables together with a categorical treatment by time interaction will be fitted to explore treatment effects over time. All results will be presented with 95% confidence intervals and <italic>p</italic>-values. A partial cluster regression model to account for the possible clustering effects of participants within volunteers will also be fitted to the primary outcome within the mixed model framework. Intra-cluster coefficients will be estimated and reported if non-negligible.</p>
                <p id="Par74">Depending on the extent of missing primary outcome data, the primary analysis will be repeated using the complete data set generated using multiple imputations. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to investigate the potential effects of non-random missing data and of any co-interventions on the results and conclusions.</p>

A within-trial analysis will estimate the cost-effectiveness at 18 months. A longer-term analysis will estimate the cost-effectiveness using a decision analytic model.</p>
                <p id="Par79">The within-trial analysis will adopt a micro-costing approach to estimate the costs related to the intervention. Study logbooks, questionnaires and volunteers’ time and travel diaries will collect resource use information at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months for volunteer and participant time and travel, and health and social care use. Associated training costs will also be measured and reported separately. The resource use will be combined with unit cost data obtained from published sources such as the NHS reference costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the British National Formulary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the Prescription Cost Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] for England. Volunteer and participant time will be converted to costs using the value of leisure time. The primary outcome measure for the economic analysis will be quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) derived from utility scores, obtained from the EQ5D-5L instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and measured using the area-under-the-curve approach. Secondary economic outcomes will be Years of Full Capability (YFC), obtained from the ICECAP-O measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Both QALYs and YFC will be measured for the participants and volunteers. Any differences in baseline utility and capability index scores will be adjusted for in the analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par80">The economic evaluation will take the form of a cost-utility analysis (CUA) where the result will be expressed as a ‘cost per QALY’. In addition, a ‘cost per capability’ (CCapA) achieved will be estimated by combining the cost with improvements in capability. The analysis will report results of the CUA and CCapA from a health and social care perspective, including costs related to health and social care and QALYs/Capabilities accruing to the participants. Then, the analysis will be broadened to take a societal perspective including societal costs and outcomes for both participants and volunteers. Missing data will be explored and imputed using the most appropriate imputation technique that will depend on the nature of the missingness. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to explore any uncertainties surrounding the key parameters using bootstrapping methods to estimate confidence intervals around the incremental cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be generated to estimate the probability of the ACE intervention being cost-effective at different threshold willingness to pay values for a QALY. CHEERS guidelines will be followed for reporting the economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par122">Breaking the spiral of age-related decline that is characterised by loss of physical and cognitive function, reduced capacity to independently manage daily tasks, and reductions in social interaction is fundamental to healthy ageing. It also has the potential to substantially reduce reliance on health and social care services. This is particularly true for those who are at risk of mobility-related disability resulting from low levels of physical activity as they settle into changed routines after their primary working years.</p>
              <p id="Par123">Prospective cohort studies and trial data demonstrate that both moderate and lighter-intensity physical activity are associated with a lower risk of mobility disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. An active older person has a 36% lower risk of developing functional limitations and a 38% lower risk of hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The wider health and well-being benefits associated with physical activity in older age are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, in the UK, levels of activity decrease with age, with 47.9% of people aged 65 years and older being classified as inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par124">Recent policy documents, including the NHS Long Term Plan, call for new service models to proactively support older people living with frailty in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A consensus statement led by Public Health England identifies five key commitments towards healthy ageing: prioritising prevention initiatives; removing barriers and creating more opportunities for older adults to contribute to society; adopting a range of community-centred approaches that support and encourage community participation; narrowing inequalities and challenging ageism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The ACE study aligns with these commitments, is relevant to policies targeting living independently in the community and has strategic importance for social and health care policy across the UK. The voluntary sector is an untapped resource, ideally placed to deliver low-cost and effective interventions and to increase access to disadvantaged populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, there have been few high-quality trials evaluating community approaches that mobilise peer volunteers to promote active ageing and none that specifically target people at risk of mobility disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par125">ACE is the largest, pragmatic (defined as measuring effectiveness in real-life settings) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], community-based trial in the UK to target this high-risk segment of the older population by mobilising community resources (peer volunteers). ACE is also the first study of its kind to conduct a full economic and comprehensive process evaluation alongside the RCT. If effective and cost-effective, the ACE intervention has strong potential to be implemented widely in the UK and elsewhere.</p>
