                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Sepsis is a common, potentially life-threatening complication of infection. The optimal treatment for sepsis includes prompt antibiotics and intravenous fluids, facilitated by its early and accurate recognition. Currently, clinicians identify and assess severity of suspected sepsis using validated clinical scoring systems. In England, the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) has been mandated across all National Health Service (NHS) trusts and ambulance organisations. Like many clinical scoring systems, NEWS2 should not be used without clinical judgement to determine either the level of acuity or a diagnosis. Despite this, there is a tendency to overemphasise the score in isolation in patients with suspected infection, leading to the overprescription of antibiotics and potentially treatment-related complications and rising antimicrobial resistance. The biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) has been shown to be useful in specific circumstances to support appropriate antibiotics prescribing by identifying bacterial infection. PCT is not routinely used in the care of undifferentiated patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs), and the evidence base of its optimal usage is poor. The PROcalcitonin and NEWS2 evaluation for Timely identification of sepsis and Optimal (PRONTO) study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in adults with suspected sepsis presenting to the ED to compare standard clinical management based on NEWS2 scoring plus PCT-guided risk assessment with standard clinical management based on NEWS2 scoring alone and compare if this approach reduces prescriptions of antibiotics without increasing mortality.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>PRONTO is a parallel two-arm open-label individually RCT set in up to 20 NHS EDs in the UK with a target sample size of 7676 participants. Participants will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to standard clinical management based on NEWS2 scoring or standard clinical management based on NEWS2 scoring plus PCT-guided risk assessment. We will compare whether the addition of PCT measurement to NEWS2 scoring can lead to a reduction in intravenous antibiotic initiation in ED patients managed as suspected sepsis, with at least no increase in 28-day mortality compared with NEWS2 scoring alone (in conjunction with local standard care pathways). PRONTO has two coprimary endpoints: initiation of intravenous antibiotics at 3 hours (superiority comparison) and 28-day mortality (non-inferiority comparison). The study has an internal pilot phase and group-sequential stopping rules for effectiveness and futility/safety, as well as a qualitative substudy and a health economic evaluation.</p>

                  <p>The trial protocol was approved by the Health Research Authority (HRA) and NHS Research Ethics Committee (Wales REC 2, reference 20/WA/0058). In England and Wales, the law allows the use of deferred consent in approved research situations (including ED studies) where the time dependent nature of intervention would not allow true informed consent to be obtained. PRONTO has approval for a deferred consent process to be used. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences.</p>

              <p>Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and is a medical emergency requiring prompt antimicrobial therapy and physiological support. The identification, assessment and management of sepsis is challenging because of its many non-specific symptoms and signs, which can be caused by both infectious and non-infectious diseases. In line with international recommendations, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) sepsis guidelines suggest the administration of intravenous antibiotics within an hour in patients at risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, up to 50% of patients initially managed as sepsis in the emergency department (ED) do not have a final diagnosis of sepsis<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> and often do not have an infection.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> The current approach leads to overuse of antibiotics with the associated risk of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic-related adverse drug reactions (eg, <italic toggle="yes">Clostridium difficile</italic> infection)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and extended hospital stays.</p>
              <p>The challenge of delivering high-quality sepsis care in an ED setting has been well recognised.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> The third international consensus definition (Sepsis 3)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> recommended use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, to identify patients at high risk of death and prolonged ICU stay. National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and NEWS2 are rapid physiology-based scoring systems which are used to detect and track the deteriorating patient. NEWS has been demonstrated to have better diagnostic accuracy to qSOFA in detection of severe outcomes in sepsis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> However, with its higher sensitivity comes reduced specificity which can result in significant increased numbers of patients being managed as high risk for suspected sepsis with a corresponding pressure on ED departments. NEWS2 replaced NEWS scoring system as the standard monitoring tool in the National Health Service (NHS) in 2019<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and has been found to be comparable or superior to NEWS.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref> In October 2021, Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended that immediate antibiotics (within 1 hour) should be targeted to those with septic shock and others with suspected sepsis could wait for up to 3 hours for initial assessment to target antimicrobial choice or identify non-infectious mimics.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
              <p>The emergence of COVID-19 has exacerbated this previously highlighted problem. COVID-19 is a viral infection which presents within the sepsis syndrome constellation. Secondary bacterial infections are uncommon at presentation to ED (3.5%),<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> despite this up to 83% of patients with COVID-19 received antibiotics.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> NEWS2 scores are broadly predictive of COVID-19 outcome on presentation but does not appear to be predictive of bacterial coinfection.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Initial investigations in the ED can be helpful in distinguishing between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia including typical radiographic change, and COVID-19 point-of-care diagnostics.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These results would be available within 3 hours for assessment and could potentially reduce unnecessary antimicrobial usage in COVID-19 management.</p>
              <p>Procalcitonin (PCT) is a reliable biomarker that changes early in the course of bacterial infection. A recent PCT is currently the biomarker with the most available evidence to identify bacterial infections and inform antibiotic prescription decisions. Cochrane meta-analysis<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> demonstrated that the use of PCT to guide antibiotic treatment in patients with acute respiratory infections reduced antibiotic exposure and side effects, and improved survival. Nevertheless, while the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PCT assays for use in sepsis, current UK NICE guidance does not recommend PCT use on the basis of insufficient evidence.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> PCT predictive of outcome in COVID-19, and this may be because of its ability to identify superadded bacterial infection.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11 24</xref> The available evidence suggests a low PCT will have good negative predictive value for a bacterial coinfection in cases of COVID-19.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

                <title>Informed consent</title>
                <p>Research carried out in emergency situations is challenging in terms of obtaining consent. Emergency research is when treatment needs to be given urgently, and it is necessary to take urgent action for the purposes of the study. In some emergency situations people may lack capacity to give consent themselves and obtaining consent from a legal representative or consulting others is not reasonably practicable. In England and Wales, the law allows adults who lack capacity to take part in emergency research without prior consent from a legal representative or consulting others, if certain conditions are met (Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amendment (No 2) Regulations SI 2006 2984, Mental Capacity Act s32).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Given the requirement for rapid clinical assessment and treatment in the management of suspected sepsis, for this trial we will use a deferred consent model. Patients and their relatives will be informed that a study is ongoing but a lengthy consent discussion will not be had so as not to delay treatment. Should the patient or consultee wish not to take part at this point, then the decision will be respected and the patient will not be enrolled into the trial. Following randomisation an approach to obtain informed consent will be made as soon as is practicably feasible, ideally within 72 hours (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Where a participant lacks mental capacity, a maximum of three approaches will be made. After three approaches, or if the participant is not likely to regain mental capacity, a personal consultee will be approached. In extreme circumstances, where no personal consultee can be identified, a nominated consultee will be approached. Separate informed consent will be taken for participation in the qualitative data collection. Patients who do not consent to continue in the study will be withdrawn completely from the study. A tiered consent model is used in this study and allows participants to consent to different aspects of the study (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix table 1</xref>). An example participant consent form is available in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix</xref>.</p>

                <p>A planned interim analysis of the coprimary outcomes will be conducted when 50% of patients have been recruited and followed up for 28 days. Stopping the study shall be recommended by the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) based on group-sequential O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. They shall recommend stopping for effectiveness if:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>The PCT-guided assessment is superior in terms of 28-day mortality (ie, a significant reduction to less than 15%).</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>The PCT-guided assessment is non-inferior in terms of 28-day mortality and superior in terms of initiation of antibiotics.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>They shall recommend stopping for futility if the results of the interim analysis suggest futility for both endpoints. This strategy ensures overall type I error rate control.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> The exact stopping rules will be specified in an interim analysis plan.</p>

                <title>Final analysis</title>
                <p>The primary analysis will be intention to treat and will fit separate two-level logistic regression models (patients nested within sites) to both coprimary outcomes (antibiotic initiation and mortality), controlling for baseline NEWS2 score (minimisation factor). The intervention will be considered effective if there is both a significant reduction in antibiotic initiation (two-sided 5% level) and if the difference in mortality between the two groups is non-inferior (one-sided 5% level). In case the 28-day mortality rate in the control arm deviates from the assumed 15%, the absolute 2.5% non-inferiority margin will be replaced with an arcsine difference ‘non-inferiority frontier’.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The primary analysis will be adjusted to account for the group-sequential design. Imputation of missing data will be done as part of sensitivity analyses.</p>
                <p>In a secondary analysis, complier adjusted causal effect models will be fitted to allow for non-adherence to the intervention. Two models will be fitted allowing for two different definitions of adherence:</p>
                <list list-type="order">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Patients randomised to PCT-guided care in whom a PCT test is done and the clinician considers the results as part of their decision making.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Patients randomised to PCT-guided care in whom a PCT test is done and the clinician follows the algorithm exactly.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>Analyses of secondary outcomes will also be performed as intention to treat and using appropriate two-level regression models depending on the type of outcome (eg, linear regression for continuous outcomes, Cox regression for time-to-event outcomes) to allow for patients nested within sites. This includes an HTA and economic evaluation as per CHEERS 2022 guidance. Analyses will be split by organ system of the infection (eg, lower urinary tract, lower respiratory, intra-abdominal, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue). Stratified analyses will be undertaken at different levels of NEWS2 scoring ≤4, 5–6 and ≥7, and will also be undertaken by COVID-19 status. All further details will be specified in a statistical analysis plan which will be finalised prior to database lock for the planned interim analysis and subsequently published.</p>
                <p>Missing primary outcome data are likely to be minimal, so complete-case analysis will be used. However, if this exceeds more than 20% of participants we will employ multiple imputation and report the impact on the treatment effect alongside the complete-case analysis.</p>

              <title>Qualitative study</title>
              <p>The qualitative work will have three components: interviews with clinicians, interviews with patients/carers, and observations of trial implementation (when appropriate during the ongoing current COVID-19 pandemic). Findings will be used to aid understanding of the quantitative data and provide areas for improvement in processes to enhance the efficiency of the trial.</p>
              <p>Interviews with clinicians will take place at two time points. Interview 1 will take place during the pilot phase and will be a semistructured interview with 10–12 clinicians at &lt;5 study sites (2–3 per site). This will explore the feasibility and acceptability of research processes and integration of the PCT algorithm into their ED setting. Interview 2 will be with clinicians towards the end of the trial when they have more experience of using the PCT algorithm and will identify barriers and facilitators to the use of the PCT test and algorithm in more detail, including reasons for deviating from the study algorithm.</p>
              <p>We will conduct semistructured interviews with patients after the 90-day follow-up, in order to gain a detailed understanding of patients’ experiences of care to aid understanding of trial results. We will encourage patients to include a close family member in the interview also. This will allow us to capture an additional perspective on the patients’ care.</p>

              <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
              <p>The proposal has benefited from multiple interactions with patient and public involvement (PPI) groups to refine the research question and design. Author JC is a lay coapplicant/patient representative, who has coproduced and helped finalise the study design. As a coapplicant JC is a member of the trial management group (TMG) ensuring that all patient facing materials are presented in a suitable way. Her experience is invaluable throughout the project, including the promotion of the trial to potential participants and appropriate dissemination of findings to the lay public.</p>
              <p>In addition, we have convened wider PPI advisory panels from both higher education institutions and NHS patient groups. We discussed the trial with the panel at the Royal Liverpool Hospital in August 2018, focusing on need, conception, design and trial management. The group fully supported the need for this trial recognising the potential for PCT measurement to improve outcomes for patients with suspected sepsis and supported the use of deferred consent. Specific feedback about these aspects has now been used to update the relevant parts of the proposal.</p>

                <p>The trial was approved by the NHS Research Ethics Committee (Wales REC 2, reference 20/WA/0058) on the 21 July 2020 and subsequent Health Research Authority (HRA) and Health and Care Research Wales approval was granted on 22 July 2020. In England and Wales, the law allows the use of deferred consent in approved research situations (including ED studies) where the time dependent nature of intervention would not allow true informed consent to be obtained. PRONTO has approval for a deferred consent process to be used, full details are in Informed Consent section above. The following substantial amendments were made to the trial and were communicated to all trial sites: Amendment 5 (23 October 2020); Amendment 7 (10 December 2020); Amendment 9 (25 February 2021); Amendment 12 (29 June 2021), Amendment 15 (15 October 2021), Amendment 17 (6 January 2022).</p>
