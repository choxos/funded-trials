            <p><italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (group A <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic>, Strep A) is responsible for half a million deaths worldwide each year, mainly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), through severe invasive infections and immune complications including rheumatic heart disease [<xref rid="jiad153-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Development of a vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> was declared a global health research priority in 2018 by the World Health Assembly. An ideal vaccine would substantially reduce <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> transmission, disease, and perhaps colonization, without provoking immune-mediated complications [<xref rid="jiad153-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Observational data demonstrate decreased <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> incidence with increasing age, possibly explained by naturally acquired immunity [<xref rid="jiad153-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Estimated point prevalence of asymptomatic pharyngeal colonization with <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogene</italic>s is 6.6%–9.7% in children [<xref rid="jiad153-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Characterizing protective immunity generated by infections and colonization remains a major knowledge gap in designing effective and safe vaccines, particularly from LMIC settings [<xref rid="jiad153-B5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>].</p>
            <p>Epidemiological observations have demonstrated association between invasive <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> infections and respiratory viral infections, especially influenza [<xref rid="jiad153-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> was responsible for substantial mortality in influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 [<xref rid="jiad153-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is important to understand whether respiratory viruses increase colonization with pathogenic bacteria such as <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> in the nasopharynx, as colonization may be a necessary preceding event to pharyngitis and invasive disease. We have recently demonstrated that intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), used as a surrogate viral challenge agent, induces modest increases in <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> colonization and density in the 21 days following vaccination in Gambian children [<xref rid="jiad153-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We conducted a post hoc analysis of this randomized controlled trial of LAIV in children aged 24–59 months to explore whether LAIV increased nasopharyngeal <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> colonization, and whether colonization was associated with a serological response to several <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> antigens.</p>

                <title>Study Population and Design</title>
                <p>We conducted a post hoc observational study nested within a randomized controlled trial of LAIV, studying immunogenicity, viral shedding and microbiome interactions in children aged 24–59 months in Sukauta, an urban region of The Gambia. The study (NCT02972957) was conducted over 2 years between February to April 2017, and January to March 2018 [<xref rid="jiad153-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Children were randomized 2:1 to receive LAIV at study entry (day 0, LAIV group) or on day 21 (control group), which was the end of active follow-up. All participants were influenza-vaccine naive and clinically well, with no history of respiratory illness in the prior 14 days. Participants in LAIV and control groups were recruited simultaneously to avoid bias via seasonal variation. Baseline respiratory virus status was determined with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<xref rid="jiad153-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Children were immunized with the Northern Hemisphere Russian-backbone Trivalent LAIV (Nasovac-S, Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) [<xref rid="jiad153-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Data on symptoms experienced between days 0 and 7 were collected at the day 7 visit, and symptoms experienced between days 7 and 21 recorded at the day 21 visit. The study was approved by the Joint Medical Research Council/Gambia Government ethics committee (reference 16193). Informed consent was obtained from all parents, including for subsequent research on their samples.</p>

                <p>Participants had a nasopharyngeal swab taken at day 0 (immediately prior to LAIV receipt), days 7 and 21, using flocked swabs (FLOQSwabs) stored in RNAprotect (Qiagen). Samples were processed within 4 hours of collection and stored at −70°C until further processing. DNA was extracted from 200 μL of RNAprotect using the AGOWA Mag Mini DNA extraction kit (LGC Genomics) in combination with phenol-bead beating as previously described [<xref rid="jiad153-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Standard curves were generated via extraction of total genomic DNA from the <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> H293 reference strain, ranging from 1 to 10 000 000 genome copies per μL. Quantitative PCR was performed using QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System, using primers and probes to detect the <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes-</italic>specific gene <italic toggle="yes">speB</italic> (forward, CTAAACCCTTCAGCTCTTGGTACTG; reverse, TTGATGCCTACAACAGCACTTTG, Probe: Cy5-CGGCGCAGGCGGCTTCAAC-BHQ2) [<xref rid="jiad153-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A cycle threshold (Ct) of 40 was defined as positive, but all curves above Ct threshold of 35 were checked manually to ensure appearance was consistent with true amplification of the target. Samples were run in triplicate. Where only 1 of the triplicates showed the presence of <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic>, samples were repeated and only defined as positive if at least 2 triplicates were positive on repeat testing. A participant with positive quantitative PCR (qPCR) result at a given time point was considered colonized. All participants were included in the colonization study group. Participants who were negative at baseline were included in the acquisition study group (<xref rid="jiad153-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Study profile: 320 participants were randomized 2:1 to the LAIV (day 0 vaccine) or control (day 21 vaccine) group. All participants (colonization study group) had <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> colonization status determined by quantitative PCR at day 0, 7, and 21. Of the 320 participants, 294 were negative at baseline (the acquisition study group). Only participants receiving LAIV at day 0 had serum taken at days 0 and 21 (n = 212). Serum from day 21 was available from 40/48 participants from the LAIV group who were colonized at any time point and from 61/164 randomly selected noncolonized participants. Paired serum (pre-/postcolonization) was available from 18/35 participants who acquired colonization during the study period. Created with BioRender.com.

                <title>Antibody Measurement</title>
                <p>Blood was collected in serum separation tubes from participants in the LAIV group, for study end points on influenza vaccine immunogenicity [<xref rid="jiad153-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For the serology study, participants were categorized as colonized if <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> was detected by qPCR at any time point. Participants in the acquisition study group (negative at day 0) were categorized as newly colonized if <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> was detected at either day 7 or 21. All available serum collected on day 21 from colonized participants was tested, along with a random selection from noncolonized participants (a 1:1.5 ratio of colonized to noncolonized participants). Of newly colonized participants, a subgroup of 18 had paired serum (pre-/postcolonization) available for testing.</p>
                <p>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) optimization was performed to determine optimal <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> protein coating concentrations, blocking buffer solution, serum dilution, and secondary antibody concentration. Ninety-six–well flat-bottomed high-binding ELISA plates were coated overnight with several recombinant proteins in pH 9.6 carbonate buffer: <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> cell envelope protease (SpyCEP) at 0.16 μg/mL, <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> adhesion and division protein (SpyAD) at 1 μg/mL, M1 protein at 0.5 μg/mL, Mac/IdeS protein (henceforth referred to as Mac) at 1 μg/mL, and collagen binding protein (Cpa) at 0.16 μg/mL. Proteins were provided by National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, UK and derived from the reference SF370 strain (M1/<italic toggle="yes">emm</italic>1/FCT-2) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref>) [<xref rid="jiad153-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Blocking and serum dilution was performed using 1% casein blocking buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Serum was diluted to 1:100 for Cpa and Mac, and 1:800 for M1, SpyCEP, and SpyAD, and applied to protein-coated wells. Bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected with goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Invitrogen), diluted to 1:500, then incubated with SureBlue 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) 1-Component Peroxidase Substrate (KPL). The reaction was stopped with 1% hydrochloric acid and optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm, subtracting background OD. Six washes were performed between each ELISA step with 0.05% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline. To quantify anti-protein IgG activity in participant sera, 12 serial 3-fold dilutions of pooled human immunoglobulin (Gammanorm, Octapharm) were used to generate standard curves commencing at 1:33.3 dilution (14.85 mg/mL) in 1% casein buffer. Seroconversion between days 0 and 21 was considered as a 2-fold rise in antibody titer, or 4-fold rise in antibody titer if raw optical density measurements were &lt;0.25 at baseline, as per previously published definitions [<xref rid="jiad153-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
                <p>To measure antibody titers to the additional vaccine antigens group A carbohydrate (GAC) and streptolysin O (SLO), an optimized 4-plex (GAC, SLO, SpyCEP, SpyAD) serology assay using the Luminex platform was performed on all available sera using a described protocol [<xref rid="jiad153-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. All antigens were supplied by GSK Vaccine Institute for Global Health. All sera with ELISA data were tested, except 2 samples from noncolonized participants where there was no remaining volume. Samples were tested in duplicate at a dilution of 1:8100 alongside standard curves derived from pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; Privigen, CSL Behring). Mean florescence intensity was measured for each antigen with a Luminex 200 instrument (Invitrogen).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>All statistical analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.1). Comparison of <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> colonization status and incident acquisition between children who received LAIV and those who did not was performed using χ<sup>2</sup> test. In addition, logistic and generalized mixed effects logistic regression models, accounting for multiple time point sampling from individuals, were used to explore the change in colonization status over time within the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, as previously described [<xref rid="jiad153-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Covariates included were age in months, sex, the presence of asymptomatic respiratory viruses at baseline, time point (day 0 vs day 7, day 0 vs day 21) and receipt of LAIV [<xref rid="jiad153-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
                <p>Samples where optical density measured by ELISA fell below the detection limit of the standard curve, were allocated a random value between zero and the limit of detection. Antibody titers in Luminex data were interpolated using xPonent 4.2 software (Luminex Corporation) using 5-parameter logistic regression. For the 4-plex Luminex assay, where both limit of accurate quantification and detection were characterized, results falling below respective limits were randomly assigned a value between zero and the lowest value of each limit [<xref rid="jiad153-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Antibody data (IVIG-adjusted anti-protein activity in mg/mL for ELISA and relative Luminex units [RLU/mL] for Luminex assay) were log transformed and assessed for normality using QQplot and the Shapiro-Wilk test. Log transformed antibody quantities between groups were compared using Student <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test. Paired Student <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test was performed to compare antibody levels before and after <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> colonization from individual participants. A <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. Correlation between log transformed antibody titers to different antigens within individuals was assessed with the Spearman method.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this post hoc study of a randomized controlled trial in The Gambia, we analyzed the impact of LAIV on <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> nasopharyngeal colonization in children aged 24–59 months. Using PCR to define colonization events, we observed an 8% prevalence at study baseline. Our data demonstrate only a modest impact of LAIV on colonization rates. We observed nonsignificantly increased rates and odds of new colonization in the LAIV group and increased odds of colonization at day 21 compared to baseline in the LAIV group only. During the 21-day study, 22% of children were colonized at 1 or more time points, with most (73%) only colonized once. The dynamic picture of colonization we observed may be partially influenced by LAIV administration and reflects the common exposure of children to <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogene</italic>s in areas with a high burden of disease. Our findings are consistent with published estimates from LMICs [<xref rid="jiad153-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> was responsible for substantial mortality in influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 [<xref rid="jiad153-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The impact of respiratory viruses on pharyngeal colonization, modulation of host-pathogen interaction, and promoting severe <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> disease is complex and poorly understood [<xref rid="jiad153-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref>]. While mice administered with a nonlethal challenge with <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> following an influenza challenge frequently had a severe and fatal disease course [<xref rid="jiad153-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], mice vaccinated with LAIV were protected from <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> superinfection [<xref rid="jiad153-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Few models have specifically investigated the impact of respiratory viruses on pharyngeal colonization [<xref rid="jiad153-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Through the <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> human challenge model, cochallenge studies with LAIV could reveal mechanistic insights into the interaction between influenza virus, <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic>, and host immune responses [<xref rid="jiad153-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A cochallenge study with <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> and LAIV has shown how virus-induced inflammatory responses and impaired innate immune responses promote bacterial colonization [<xref rid="jiad153-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Whilst no impact on colonization density was demonstrated in this study, it is possible that the observed rates of acquisition in the LAIV group was due to modestly increased colonization density, reaching a threshold for PCR positivity. This mechanism has been observed for other bacteria including <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae,</italic> both in this study population and in other settings [<xref rid="jiad153-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our data provide further evidence that the impact of LAIV on colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria is only modest and supports the wider rollout of LAIV to reduce influenza disease and its complications in LMICs.</p>
              <p>We also demonstrate that asymptomatic <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> colonization leads to seroconversion to several antigens representative of different stages of <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> infection [<xref rid="jiad153-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], with higher responses observed in colonized children compared to noncolonized controls. Given that prior exposure to <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> in all children in this cohort would be similar, these differences likely reflect recent exposure. The most notable responses were seen to full-length streptococcal M1 protein and to the envelope protease SpyCEP. Reactivity to full-length M1 protein likely reflects activity to conserved M protein regions rather than type-specific reactivity, given that <italic toggle="yes">emm</italic>1 isolates have not been identified in The Gambia [<xref rid="jiad153-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. IgG antibodies to other antigens, SpyAD, Mac, GAC, and SLO, were higher in children where <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> colonization had been detected, but this was not found for IgG antibodies to Cpa. The Cpa used in our study was originally derived from the M1 FCT-2 strain SF370. Our previous study found no Gambian FCT-2 isolates, although approximately 70% were Cpa-positive FCT-3 or FCT-4 isolates [<xref rid="jiad153-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, Cpa from FCT-3 or FCT-4 shares only approximately 50% amino acid identity with Cpa from FCT-2, which may explain limited Cpa reactivity in this cohort. Noting that the antigens tested via ELISA and Luminex were obtained from different sources, there was broad concurrence between the 2 serological assays, except that IgG to SpyAD was significantly higher in colonized compared to noncolonized participants when measured by ELISA and not by Luminex. A detailed comparison of the 2 platforms to determine the optimal technique for measurement of IgG to these <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> antigens was not performed. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that asymptomatic pharyngeal colonization may induce an IgG immunological response to multiple antigens.</p>
              <p>The definition of true <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> colonization, referring to colonization <italic toggle="yes">without</italic> a serological response, risks oversimplification of a complex and dynamic state influenced by host immunity, bacterial characteristics, and environmental factors. This serologically inactive phenotype has been described with minimal serum antibody response to SLO and anti-DNAse B [<xref rid="jiad153-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our data show that serological responses following asymptomatic colonization vary across different proteins. Furthermore, in practice, colonization is often defined as an asymptomatic person with detectable <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> without serial serological testing. In detailed longitudinal analyses, seroconversion has been documented following asymptomatic acquisition of <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> in the United States and Egypt, with the highest proportion of seroconversions to type-specific M peptides and SpyAD [<xref rid="jiad153-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In another cohort study in the United States, seroconversion to type-specific M protein frequently occurred following asymptomatic acquisition and conferred protection from homologous strain reinfection [<xref rid="jiad153-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>Protection following asymptomatic colonization and <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> intranasal vaccination has been observed, but the responsible mechanisms and serological corelates of protection have not been identified [<xref rid="jiad153-B31" ref-type="bibr">31–36</xref>]. Early prospective observation demonstrated the emergence of acute rheumatic fever following asymptomatic <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> infection [<xref rid="jiad153-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that patients with rheumatic fever have more serological activity to <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> M peptides and conserved antigens than matched controls, including after asymptomatic pharyngeal colonization [<xref rid="jiad153-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="jiad153-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Asymptomatic colonization may therefore contribute to pathological immunity in endemic settings and warrants further exploration.</p>
              <p>Our study has several key limitations. Firstly, it was a post hoc analysis of a study that was not designed or powered to assess the impact of LAIV on <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> colonization. LAIV was used as a proxy for natural influenza infection and the observations may not reflect the true dynamics of <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> colonization during natural influenza infection. We defined colonization events by PCR and not by gold-standard microbiological culture of <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic>. Whilst <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> skin infection in children is common in this setting [<xref rid="jiad153-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], we did not perform microbiological culture on children reporting infected skin lesions nor sore throats in this study. Nonetheless, exclusion of all participants with either a sore throat or infected skin lesion did not dramatically alter the serological findings. Serum IgG could only be measured in the LAIV group, so no serological comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups was possible. Finally, PCR to a single preserved and specific <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> target does not allow for assessment of <italic toggle="yes">emm</italic>-type specific immunity, which is an historically important consideration for <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> serological activity.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, our study provides several important findings. Understanding both naturally occurring protective immunity and pathological autoimmunity to <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> from settings with the highest disease burden is of paramount importance for progress towards a safe and effective <italic toggle="yes">S. pyogenes</italic> vaccine. Our study adds further evidence that asymptomatic colonization may be immunologically significant, particularly in the context of influenza coinfection. Further research combining longitudinal observation with detailed microbiological and immunological investigation should be prioritized from areas of high disease prevalence to gain a deeper understanding of immunity to this major human pathogen.</p>
