                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Children referred for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often present with a broader pattern of conduct problems including oppositionality and defiance. This combination can be extremely stressful to parents, lower parents’ self-esteem and negatively impact family life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that families receive support as soon as possible after their referral. However, as clinical services are overstretched, and traditional in-person parenting intervention programmes are expensive, families often must wait times a long time prior to receiving this vital input. To address this, we have created a digital parenting programme called STEPS. It is delivered as a mobile phone app providing a set of tools and resources that can be easily accessed at parents’ convenience. This study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of STEPS in supporting parents of children with high levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention and conduct problems, who are waiting to be assessed by specialist children’s clinical services.</p>

                  <p id="Par2"><italic>Online Parent Training for The Initial Management of ADHD referrals</italic> (OPTIMA) is a two-arm superiority parallel randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot study. We aim to recruit 352 parents and their children, who have been accepted onto a waitlist in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services or similar child health services. Parents who consent will be randomised 1:1 to either the STEPS or wait-as-usual (WAU) group. The trial will be conducted remotely (online and telephone) with measures taken at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-randomisation. The primary objective is to evaluate whether STEPS reduces the severity of children’s oppositional and defiant behaviour, as rated by parents, measured at 3 months post-randomisation compared to WAU.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Digital solutions, such as mobile phone apps, have potential for delivering psychological support for parents of children with clinical-level needs in a timely and inexpensive manner. This trial will provide data on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the STEPS app, which could support the implementation of this scalable parenting intervention programme into standard clinical care and, ultimately, improve the outcomes for families of children referred to specialist child and adolescent health services.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par32">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterised by symptoms of inattention and/or impulsivity-hyperactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is associated with a range of academic, employment and social negative outcomes and impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In 2012, annual ADHD-related health, social care and education costs in the UK were estimated at £670 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These negative impacts are often driven by a broader pattern of common behaviour problems (e.g. oppositional, disruptive, defiant behaviours) in addition to the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Effective multi-modal treatments for ADHD exist but access to them in the UK is currently limited by budgetary constraints and there are long waiting lists for specialist clinical assessment, diagnosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2014, a United Kingdom Parliament Health Committee reported that even maximum acceptable waiting times for complex cases of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD were already as long as 15 weeks in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In terms of actual waiting times, the Children’s Commissioner Lightning Review in 2016 found up to 200 days delay to initial assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Prolonged waiting times may lead to families feeling unsupported during this stressful period and, importantly, to the escalation of difficulties, a decrease in motivation, poorer engagement and premature dropout from future treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par33">The goal of the <italic>Online Parent Training for the Initial Management of ADHD referrals</italic> (OPTIMA) is to provide support for families for 3 months during the period between referral acceptance and the first full clinical assessment. It focuses on supporting parents to better manage their children’s co-occurring behaviour problems. These present a major challenge to parents, increasing levels of their parenting stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and therefore the likelihood of mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. They contribute to difficult or coercive child-parent relationships that may deteriorate over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is the escalation of these behaviour problems to “crisis levels” that often lead parents with children who have ADHD-type problems to first seek specialist help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For many parents finding a way to manage their child’s disruptive and defiant behaviour is likely to be the most urgent treatment priority at the time of their initial referral.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Effective ways to help parents manage these behaviour problems already exist—these come broadly under the term Parent Training (PT; (1)). Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show that PT improves parent-child relations and reduces challenging behaviour in children with ADHD, both as seen from the parents’ point of view and by independent observers who are blind to treatment assignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. PT is traditionally delivered face-to-face either in small groups or on a one-to-one basis, which means that it is costly to provide and time-consuming to organise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. PT is typically only offered after a full clinical assessment has been made and an ADHD diagnosis is given. This means that even in the best-case scenario parents can be left without support and guidance for long periods while waiting for the assessment process to take its course. This risks the further deterioration of the parent-child relationship and escalation of the child’s problems—with the concomitant probable effects on parent and family wellbeing that this implies. However, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that irrespective of the length of the waiting period before a full assessment is given, support should be made available to parents soon after their referral is made—allowing them to start addressing their children’s behavioural difficulties early on.</p>
                <p id="Par35">In OPTIMA, we address this challenge by employing a digital intervention, a parenting app, designed to provide parents on the waitlist with support and advice so that they can better manage their children’s behaviour. Three studies have examined digital PT for families with children showing ADHD-type problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Studies that compared online PT to a waitlist condition showed significant reductions in children’s problem behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and an increase in parental competence, satisfaction in their parenting role and maternal wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While these positive results are encouraging, small sample sizes in these studies and the different intervention content mean that their results should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, a large and adequately powered trial, such as OPTIMA, is required to provide further data on the effectiveness of digital parenting intervention programmes.</p>
                <p id="Par36">The present study will be an RCT to evaluate a new app called STEPS (Structured E-Parenting Support). Inspired by the New Forest Parenting Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], STEPS was designed specifically to help parents manage the behaviour of their children referred with concerns regarding inattention and hyperactivity and impulsiveness (also described as ADHD-type), when used during the early post-referral/waitlist period. Key app objectives include the following: (i) increase parents’ knowledge of why their children behave in challenging ways, (ii) increase parents’ awareness of the importance of self-care and building their confidence as a parent, (iii) strengthen parent-child relationships and emphasise the importance of praise, (iv) facilitate effective communication patterns and (v) give parents practical needs-based guidance, strategies and text resources allowing the more effective management of their children’s behaviour. To keep costs to a minimum and to ensure that STEPS is a practical option that could be implemented within existing health service resources, there is no personal clinical support for parents using the app. However, information on how to access the appropriate clinical service if required (CAMHS or general practitioner) is provided within the Frequently Asked Questions accessible through the app Settings. Technical support is also provided for parents having difficulties with using the app. In OPTIMA, STEPS will be evaluated, against wait-as-usual (WAU), using a two-arm parallel randomised controlled superiority trial with an internal pilot. In line with the latest Medical Research Council guidelines for the evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], an embedded process evaluation will aim to explain the study outcomes and explore the contextual factors that might influence those outcomes. The process evaluation will be described in a separate protocol. The RCT will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of STEPS.</p>

WAU, therefore, is the most appropriate comparator. Those randomised to WAU will receive STEPS after they have completed the 12-month OPTIMA follow-up. In the sites across our three centres, given the current length of waiting lists in the UK, we do not expect any children to receive their clinical assessment and initiate treatment within the first 3 months of randomisation or few families, if any, to engage in self-initiated treatment during this period. Parents will not be stopped from initiating access to services over any of the 12 months of the trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par69">STEPS (Structured E-Parenting Support; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is a mobile phone application (app) that provides a set of tools to support parents to manage their 5–11 years old children’s behavioural problems. Its content has been shaped by research about parenting and child behaviour and many years of clinical experience. The content is delivered using short videos and audio clips. There is no personal clinical support for parents using STEPS. The app also includes downloadable resources and space to record audio or written notes. The app aims to be flexible and convenient; parents can move through the eight modules (steps) at their own pace and in their own time. However, the order in which parents progress through the modules is fixed. It takes about 20 min to complete each module. For more detailed information about the content and structure of each module, see Kostyrka-Allchorne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. STEPS works on most smartphones using the iOS or Android operating systems. It is available to download through the public app stores; however, access is controlled through the use of study IDs required to register on the app.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Screenshots of the STEPS app: <bold>a</bold> the app home screen; <bold>b</bold> example module screen; <bold>c</bold> reflection screen; <bold>d</bold> skills screen</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6952_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

These will be used to provide descriptive information about app usage patterns. The format of the app usage data is being finalised as part of the further app development, so we are not yet able to specify the app usage variable(s) up to T2 that will be used as the effect modifier. Likely options include the number of modules started or the total time engaging with the app. We will aim to specify this in the statistical analysis plan.</p>

                <p id="Par99">A total of 352 parents and their children will be recruited into the study. This power calculation is based on projected effects at the primary endpoint (3 months post-randomisation). As behaviour problems measured with the ODD subscale of the SNAP-IV questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] is our primary outcome, we estimated the smallest difference of clinical importance between STEPS and WAU to be equivalent to an effect size d = 0.4 standard deviations based on the NICE guidance supporting the use of PT for the treatment of ODD or conduct disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A within-trial drop-out rate of 25% is assumed. This is higher than in most previous trials of face-to-face PT programmes because of the unsupported nature of STEPS in OPTIMA. We will monitor drop-out rates during the internal pilot and, if necessary, recalculate the sample size if it is higher than the 25% estimated. Using Stata (version 14.0) command sampsi, ANCOVA analysis with a conservative zero correlation assumed between baseline and primary endpoint SNAP-IV ODD score, a two-sided test and an alpha of 0.05, we estimated that 176 individuals will be needed per trial arm (total <italic>n</italic> = 352) to provide 90% power to test the hypothesis that STEPS is superior to WAU.</p>

Similar statistical models will be used to test for intervention effects on the other continuous secondary (parent-rated hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention, parenting style, satisfaction and efficacy, child-parent closeness and parenting-related strain) and exploratory (average levels of directly observer-rated child behaviour problems (CODSS), parent-rated emotional problems) outcome scale scores.

                  <title>Exploratory post-randomisation effect modifier analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par126">Two exploratory post-randomisation effect modification analyses will be conducted. First, we will analyse the impact of the app usage (likely in terms of a number of completed modules or total time spent in the app) collected up to T2 on the effects of STEPS on the primary ODD outcome measured at 3 months post-randomisation (T2) and the secondary ODD outcome measured at 12 months (T5). Second, the impact of clinical contact/care: up to 3 months (T2) on the effects of the STEPS app on the ODD primary outcome at 3 months post-randomisation, and up to 12 months post-randomisation (T5) on the effects of the STEPS app on the ODD secondary outcome at 12 months. Clinical contact/care will include any treatment during the trial up to the two specified time points. The clinical care variables used as post-randomisation effect modifier will be extracted from the service use form (the CA-SUS) and will likely be somewhat post hoc as we are not currently sure which variables are most appropriate; this approach will be made clear to the reader in the subsequent publication. We plan to use appropriate methods for post-randomisation variables to explore whether the effects of interventions differ by these variables, such as principal stratification analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Further details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.</p>

                  <title>Health economic analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par127">The economic evaluation will adopt the <italic>National Health Service</italic> (NHS)/personal social services perspective preferred by NICE, including health and social care services provided in education settings services, given the age of the population. Resource-use data collected using the CA-SUS will be costed using nationally applicable unit costs (e.g. P<italic>ersonal Social Services Research Unit Costs of Health and Social Care</italic>, <italic>NHS Reference Costs, British National Formulary</italic> for medications). The STEPS app will be costed in consultation with the application developers. Patterns and potential mechanisms influencing missing data will be explored to inform appropriate methods for handling missing data such as multiple imputation.</p>
                  <p id="Par128">The primary economic evaluation will be a cost-utility analysis carried out at 3 months post-randomisation with outcomes expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), using the proxy version of the CHU9D completed by a parent. Secondary economic analyses will include (i) a cost-utility analysis at 12 months post-randomisation to assess cost-effectiveness after formal assessment and treatment, (ii) a cost-effectiveness analysis undertaken at both 3 months and 12 months using the primary clinical measure of outcome (SNAP-IV ODD score) and (iii) a cost-utility analysis undertaken at both 3 months and 12 months combining QALYs for both the young person (using the CHU9D) and the primary parent/caregiver (using the EQ-5D-5L). Appropriate sensitivity analyses will be carried out, dependent on any assumptions made about the costing of the intervention, the method of measurement of outcomes or the approach to combining QALYs for young people and their primary carer.</p>
                  <p id="Par129">Costs and outcomes will be compared at the 3-month and 12-month follow-up points and presented as mean values by the trial arm with standard deviations. Mean differences in costs and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained by non-parametric bootstrap regressions to account for the non-normal distribution commonly found in economic data. To provide more relevant treatment-effect estimates, analyses will include an adjustment for baseline covariates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], which will be pre-specified and in line with the clinical analyses. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed using standard net-benefit approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. A joint distribution of incremental mean costs and effects for the two groups will be generated using non-parametric bootstrapping to explore the probability that each of the treatments is the optimal choice, subject to a range of possible maximum values (ceiling ratio) that a decision-maker might be willing to pay for an additional QALY (or unit improvement in behaviour problems). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be presented by plotting these probabilities for a range of possible values of the ceiling ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. These curves are a recommended decision-making approach for dealing with the uncertainty that exists around the estimates of expected costs and expected effects associated with the interventions under investigation and uncertainty regarding the maximum cost-effectiveness ratio that a decision-maker would consider acceptable.</p>

Briefly, the process evaluation will use baseline data and post-intervention quantitative trial data (e.g. app usage data, including counts and time), qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with parents and clinicians (e.g. expectations, perceptions of impact, barriers to engagement) and textbox responses to open questions to explore the mechanisms for intervention engagement and impact (child behaviour change).</p>

Post-intervention, researchers will conduct remote (telephone, video call or email) in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a subgroup of parents in the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> ~ 50). Maximum variation, purposive sampling will be used to ensure that a full range of views and experiences are captured (taking account of demographic factors and levels of app engagement). In addition, telephone interviews with clinicians (<italic>n</italic> ~ 10) will explore perceptions of the app and its perceived impact on preparing families for the formal clinical assessment. The interview schedules will be developed with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) panel input.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par141">There is substantial evidence supporting the use of parenting intervention programmes in relation to children up to the age of 11 years, who present to clinical services with behaviour difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Moreover, group and individual parent training sessions are included in the NICE clinical guidelines for the management of behavioural disorders in children and young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. However, parents face substantial difficulties in accessing this kind of help, with a long waiting list being one of the key barriers. A mobile phone parent training app, such as STEPS, has the potential to provide a low-cost solution to enable parents to have timely access to psychological interventions and, potentially, to reduce the risk of problems escalating before an in-person clinical appointment becomes available. More generally, mobile phone affordances, such as its availability in almost any place and at any time and the privacy of users, could also help to overcome other barriers to access, for example, the lack of time or resources to attend an in-person session or stigma. Finally, the restrictions on face-to-face intervention delivery introduced at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic have inadvertently accelerated the adoption of digital solutions across many domains, including health care. Yet, there remains a substantial, but unrealised, potential in terms of using digital technology to provide psychological support for parents and children because of the lack of relevant evidence.</p>
              <p id="Par142">In the OPTIMA trial, we will test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a mobile phone app called STEPS that provides a new, digital way to deliver parent training to families on children’s services waitlist. We will also examine the app usage data and qualitative information from semi-structured interviews with parents and clinicians to explore the mechanisms for intervention implementation and impact. Findings from this trial have the potential to add to the existing evidence base regarding applications of parent training and to help improve service delivery for families. The inclusion of several sites and different ways of identifying the potentially eligible families (i.e. digital vs traditional methods) will allow us to generalise our findings to a range of organisations and services. While this trial will provide data on the efficacy of STEPS in the group with clinical-level needs, future research should examine whether the app could prove effective in helping other populations, for example, families who do not meet the threshold for acceptance by specialist services.</p>
              <p id="Par143">In summary, the OPTIMA trial has the potential to inform whether parent training can be delivered effectively in a digital format and without personal clinical support. This study is also applying new digital methods to identify potentially eligible families quickly and efficiently and, thus, can serve as an example for future research.</p>

              <p>Anonymised data collected in the study will be suitable for sharing. Participants will be informed about plans for data sharing in the study information sheet and will agree to this when consenting to participate in the trial. To ensure all data can be shared, only participants who consent to data sharing will be eligible to participate in the trial. A decision of whether anonymised research data will be made publicly accessible or whether access will be controlled via data sharing agreements will be determined before depositing data in the suitable long-term storage repository and will be in line with the funder’s policies on data sharing procedures at that time.</p>
