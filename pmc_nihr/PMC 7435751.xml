                  <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are difficult outcomes to measure in clinical trials. It would be valuable to be able to predict which patients are likely to benefit in terms of exacerbation prevention based on their early response in lung function and symptoms.</p>

                  <p>This was a post-hoc analysis from the 52-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority FLAME trial. Early clinically important improvement (ECII) was defined as achievement of minimal clinically important difference in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>; ≥100 mL increase) and one patient-reported outcome (PRO): either St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (≥4-unit reduction; D1), or COPD assessment test (≥2-point reduction; D2) at Week 4 or 12.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Approximately 18–20% of patients achieved ECII at Week 4 or 12 post-randomization according to any of the two definitions. The rate of subsequent exacerbations was lower in patients who achieved ECII at Week 4 (D1: ratio of rates [95% CI], 0.85 [0.74 to 0.98]; D2, 0.88 [0.77 to 1.00]) or at Week 12 (D1, 0.85 [0.74 to 0.98]; D2, 0.86 [0.75 to 1.00]) versus patients not achieving ECII. Patients who achieved ECII experienced longer time-to-first exacerbation between Week 4 or 12 to end of study. More patients achieved ECII with indacaterol/glycopyrronium versus salmeterol/fluticasone according to both definitions at Week 4 (D1, odds ratio [95% CI], 1.69 [1.40 to 2.04]; D2, 1.61 [1.34 to 1.93]), and 12 (D1, 2.01 [1.66 to 2.44]; D2, 1.80 [1.48 to 2.18]).</p>

                  <p>ECII is a novel composite endpoint, based on clinically relevant improvement in lung function and PROs in the early phase of treatment intervention that may predict subsequent exacerbation risk and may be used in clinical trials.</p>

              <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations contribute to a decline in lung function and impaired quality of life in patients with COPD; the frequency and severity of exacerbations are positively correlated with disease progression.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Limited data are available on factors that could be predictive of exacerbations;<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> however, a history of exacerbations in the previous year is considered to be a good predictor of the occurrence of subsequent exacerbations.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Unlike outcomes such as lung function, breathlessness and exercise capacity that respond quickly to treatment,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> COPD exacerbations are difficult outcomes to measure in clinical trials. This is mainly because exacerbations may occur at variable time points during follow-up, and the frequency of exacerbations is relatively low in trials comparing effective treatments, even in those including exacerbating COPD patients.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Hence, trials with a large patient population and long follow-up duration are required to evaluate the effect of a treatment on exacerbations.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Therefore, it would be of value to identify soon after the commencement of a treatment regimen, whether that specific treatment may prevent exacerbations later, during the course of the disease. There is limited evidence on whether early clinical outcomes predict a reduction of exacerbations in the long term.</p>
              <p>Early Clinical Important Improvement (ECII) is a composite endpoint, defined as the clinically relevant improvement in both lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV<sub>1</sub>) and a patient-reported outcome (PRO) at 4 or 12 weeks, which may be useful in predicting responders early in terms of exacerbation prevention in the longer term. In the present analysis, we evaluated this novel composite endpoint as a predictor of exacerbation risk during the subsequent follow-up, using data from the FLAME study.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>

Details of the study design have been published previously.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Briefly, the study enrolled symptomatic patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> ≥25% and &lt;60% predicted), and a history of ≥1 moderate or severe COPD exacerbation(s) in the previous year. These patients received either indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) 110/50 μg once-daily (q.d.) or salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC) 50/500 μg twice-daily (b.i.d.).

The SGRQ-C and CAT are well recognized, validated and easy-to-use health questionnaires developed for patients with COPD; a reduction of ≥4 units in the SGRQ-C total score indicates MCID,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and a reduction of ≥2 points is considered as the MCID for the CAT score.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

                <p>Two time points were selected for the analysis of ECII, with Week 4 selected to discern early improvements in aforementioned outcomes and predicting early responders in terms of exacerbation prevention in the longer term, and Week 12 for further validation of these outcomes. While CAT and SGRQ both evaluate impairment in health status, evidence suggests that CAT is a more sensitive tool to detect symptoms (cough and sputum) and SGRQ is more reflective of pathophysiology.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Hence, both PROs were included in the ECII definition.</p>

                <p>Exacerbations were defined as a worsening of two or more major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume and sputum purulence) for at least two consecutive days, or worsening of any one major symptom together with an increase in any one of the minor symptoms (sore throat, colds, fever without other cause, cough and wheeze) for at least two consecutive days, occurring after randomization, compared with the baseline levels. These symptom-defined exacerbations were captured using an electronic diary, as worsening of symptoms. During the course of the study, a moderate exacerbation was defined as a worsening of COPD symptoms requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids (SCS) or antibiotics or both; an exacerbation was defined as severe if hospitalization was required in addition to treatment with SCS and/or antibiotics. These investigator-assessed exacerbations requiring healthcare use were recorded on an electronic case report form.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
                <p>The proportion of patients achieving ECII at Week 4 and/or Week 12 was calculated based on the number of patients who had the relevant data available both on Day 1 and at Week 4 or Week 12, as applicable. The rates of moderate/severe exacerbations, and the time-to-first subsequent moderate or severe exacerbation and corresponding hazard ratio (HR) were compared between patients achieving ECII and those who did not achieve ECII at Week 4 or 12. The rates and time-to-first subsequent moderate or severe exacerbations were assessed between Weeks 4 and 52 for the evaluation of ECII at Week 4, and between Weeks 12 and 52, for the evaluation of ECII at Week 12. The effect of treatment on ECII was assessed by comparing the proportion of patients achieving ECII with IND/GLY versus those receiving SFC, using both definitions of ECII.</p>

                <p>The analysis was performed using the full analysis set (FAS) from the FLAME study. FAS included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The number of moderate or severe exacerbations that occurred during the follow-up treatment periods (from Week 4 or 12 to the end of treatment for the ECII evaluation at Weeks 4 and 12, respectively) was analyzed using a generalised linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution for the rates of moderate or severe exacerbations experienced during the follow-up treatment period. The model included ECII response status at either Week 4 or 12, baseline smoking status, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use at screening, baseline severity of airflow limitation, baseline total symptom score, history of COPD exacerbations in the 1 year prior to screening and region as terms of fixed effects for comparing the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations experienced by the two treatment groups. Time-to-first COPD exacerbation was analyzed using a Cox regression model that included the same terms as the generalized linear model. In the FLAME study, exacerbations were reported in &lt;50% of patients treated with IND/GLY; hence, the time-to-first-exacerbation was evaluated in terms of the time at which at least 25% of patients had a first moderate or severe exacerbation instead of the median time.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A logistic regression model was used to analyze the proportion of patients achieving ECII at either Week 4 or Week 12.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this analysis, we evaluated the novel composite endpoint of ECII for the first time using data from the FLAME study.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We have shown that patients who achieve ECII at Week 4 or 12 are at a lower risk of subsequent COPD exacerbations. Our data suggest that ECII endpoint may be used as an early predictor of exacerbation prevention in clinical trials of COPD. More patients treated with IND/GLY achieved ECII compared with those treated with SFC based on all definitions, both at Week 4 and at Week 12, confirming the potential role of this composite endpoint as a measure of early prediction of exacerbation prevention in the FLAME trial.</p>
              <p>An important observation is that a minority of patients (18–20% across definitions) achieved ECII after 4 and 12 weeks, most likely due to the strict criterion of achieving MCID in two variables (lung function and a PRO). Despite this low proportion, the composite endpoint indicated treatment differences during the remainder of the follow-up period. Importantly, the differences between the groups and between treatments were evident from Week 4, suggesting that this composite endpoint may provide clinically relevant information on the subsequent exacerbation risk and prevention by treatments early in the course of a study. Results from this analysis suggest that ECII might be a useful assessment tool to predict subsequent exacerbation risk.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have shown that both FEV<sub>1</sub> and PROs, especially health status, are associated with exacerbations. A pooled analysis of 23,213 patients from 23 clinical trials showed that greater improvements in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> were associated with significantly fewer exacerbations, and better PROs. In this analysis, the improvement in lung function was evaluated at a similar time frame to the occurrence of exacerbations.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A post-hoc analysis of three 12-month randomized trials in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD showed that FEV<sub>1</sub> response at 2 months predicts the risk of a future exacerbation at 12 months, with the rate of exacerbations during 3–12 months being significantly lower in FEV<sub>1</sub> responders at 2 months (patients with improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> ≥100 mL) compared with non-responders.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> ECII not only supports the results from these analyses but also provides evidence on short-term outcomes as early as 4 weeks, which are further validated by comparable outcomes at Week 12.</p>
              <p>ECII definitions evaluated here use trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, SGRQ-C and CAT scores, all of which are frequently used clinical trial endpoints that show responses to treatment within days or weeks.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The MCIDs of these endpoints indicate a clinically significant change in response to pharmacological treatment. Our analysis showed that using these endpoints to assess clinically important improvement at Week 4 and/or Week 12 can predict the risk of future exacerbation.</p>
              <p>Other tools have been developed or markers identified that can predict the risk of exacerbations in both the short and longer term. Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a composite endpoint that measures disease worsening in terms of rate of decline in lung function, exacerbation rate and health status. CID has been used as a composite endpoint in studies of long-acting bronchodilators, mostly of ≤26 weeks duration to enrich for deterioration events in the short term.<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> One post-hoc analysis of two 3-year studies (TORCH and ECLIPSE) has been reported to date, where CID was used to predict long-term worsening of COPD; a CID occurring within 6–12 months of follow-up was found to be associated with sustained loss of lung function and health-status and increased exacerbation and all-cause mortality risk.<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Make et al proposed SCOPEX, a score that can predict the short-term risk of exacerbations over the next 6 months.<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Unlike ECII, which predicts the risk of subsequent exacerbation early after an intervention in a clinical trial, based on improvements in clinical outcomes, SCOPEX score is an indicator of the risk of exacerbation in general, based on clinical characteristics and disease history.</p>
              <p>Exacerbations occur at relatively low frequency in trials, and often not necessarily as early as 4 or 12 weeks after baseline. The advantage of ECII is that it predicts the reduction in the rate of exacerbation, without measuring actual exacerbations, based on improvements in lung function and a patient-reported outcome, as early as Week 4. Predicting exacerbation risk as early as 4 weeks may allow for more adaptive and novel designs of clinical trials evaluating treatments aiming at exacerbation reduction. The finding that the results at 4 and 12 weeks were very similar supports the use of ECII at 4 weeks.</p>
              <p>This analysis has certain limitations. The composite endpoint, ECII, is defined based on MCIDs of the component endpoints included in the analysis. These thresholds need to be validated in large prospective trials. In the present analysis, ECII was defined using FEV<sub>1</sub>, SGRQ-C and CAT score as endpoints. We recognize that there is no universal definition of ECII and selection of endpoints may be a potential limitation. While SGRQ and CAT both assess impairment in health status, the extent of information captured is different. In addition, the preference for the use of a specific PRO may differ between clinical practice and clinical trials. Hence, it might be preferable to have ECII assessed based on either of these PROs. Future studies may help provide more information on which PRO is a more sensitive predictor, and could help in further enhancements to the definition. Factors such as change in lifestyle, comorbidities, multi-morbidities or cardiovascular disease were not adjusted for this analysis. Also, the ECII outcomes presented here are based on results from the FLAME study. Similar analyses from other studies and prospective trials using ECII are required to further validate the application of this composite endpoint, but the initial results from this analysis are promising. Besides its potential usefulness in clinical trials design and evaluation, ECII may also be useful in clinical practice as an objective measure of how patients will respond to specific treatments in terms of exacerbation prevention, providing clinicians with a tool to predict future risk.</p>
