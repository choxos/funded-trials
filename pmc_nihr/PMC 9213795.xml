                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>To characterise the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to interferon gene signature (IFNGS), demographic and clinical subgroups.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We performed post hoc analyses of pooled data from the 52-week phase III TULIP-1/TULIP-2 placebo-controlled trials of intravenous anifrolumab in moderate-to-severe SLE. Outcomes were assessed in predefined subgroups: IFNGS (high/low), age, sex, body mass index, race, geographic region, age of onset, glucocorticoid use, disease activity and serological markers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In pooled data, patients received anifrolumab 300 mg (360/726) or placebo (366/726); 82.6% were IFNGS-high. IFNGS-high patients had greater baseline disease activity and were more likely to have abnormal serological markers versus IFNGS-low patients. In the total population, a greater proportion of patients treated with anifrolumab versus placebo achieved British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response at week 52 (difference 16.6%; nominal p&lt;0.001). BICLA response treatment differences with anifrolumab versus placebo were comparable to the total population across most predefined subgroups, including subgroups for baseline glucocorticoid dosage (&lt;10/≥10 mg/day prednisone/equivalent) and for clinical disease activity (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 score &lt;10/≥10). Subgroups with larger treatment differences included IFNGS-high patients (18.2%), patients with abnormal baseline serological markers (23.1%) and Asian patients (29.2%). The safety profile of anifrolumab was similar across subgroups.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Overall, this study supports the consistent efficacy and safety of anifrolumab across a range of patients with moderate-to-severe SLE. In a few subgroups, small sample sizes limited conclusions from being drawn regarding the treatment benefit with anifrolumab.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is heterogeneous in organ involvement, severity and underlying immunopathogenesis, leading to challenges in appropriate therapy selection.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patient demographics and clinical characteristics have been associated with disease severity and therapeutic response. For example, patients with childhood-onset or adolescent-onset SLE have dysregulated type I interferon (IFN-I) signalling, and clinically more severe disease than those with adult onset.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> SLE is also more frequent and severe among Black and Asian patients than White patients, and some therapies may be less effective in Black patients.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Both demographic and clinical differences may potentially impact therapeutic response.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>IFN-Is play a key role in SLE pathogenesis, as indicated by genetic susceptibility data and the association of IFN-I pathway activation with disease activity.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref> IFN-I proteins are difficult to measure directly in the circulation<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref>; therefore, IFN-I pathway activation is quantified using IFN-I gene signatures (IFNGS).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> IFNGS are elevated in 50%–73% of adult patients with SLE.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref>
</p>
              <p>Anifrolumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds the IFN-I receptor subunit 1 with high specificity and affinity to inhibit IFN-I signalling.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 17 18</xref> In the phase III Treatment of Uncontrolled Lupus via the Interferon Pathway - 2 (TULIP-2) trial in patients with moderate-to-severe SLE, treatment response was achieved by 16.3% more patients randomised to anifrolumab than placebo,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> defined by the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA). Similar results were seen in the phase IIb MEDI-546 in Uncontrolled SLE (MUSE) and the phase III TULIP-1 trials.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 20 21</xref> Subsequently, anifrolumab has recently been approved in Canada, Japan and the US for the treatment of SLE.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>
</p>
              <p>To optimise use of a new treatment, it is important to know whether response and safety are consistent across all subgroups, or whether some patient groups will achieve greater benefit. The purpose of this analysis was to characterise the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab according to IFNGS, demographic and clinical subgroups. Pooling data from the similar TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials provided greater precision and power to assess relatively small subgroups. As IFNGS is relevant to anifrolumab’s targeted mechanism, we included detailed analyses of the IFNGS-high and IFNGS-low subgroups for both baseline features and response.</p>

                <title>Efficacy and safety end points</title>
                <p>Efficacy and safety end points were evaluated across predefined subgroups: IFNGS (high/low), age, sex, BMI (≤28/&gt;28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), race, region, age of disease onset (paediatric/adult), baseline oral glucocorticoid dosage (&lt;10/≥10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score at screening (&lt;10/≥10) and baseline serological markers (antidouble-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody positive (&gt;15 U/mL) or negative (≤15 U/mL)); complement C3 (low (&lt;0.9 g/L) or normal (≥0.9 g/L)) and complement C4 (low (&lt;0.1 g/L) or normal (≥0.1 g/L)). IFNGS status was determined by central laboratory at screening using a validated 4-gene quantitative assay.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref>
</p>
                <p>The current analysis focused primarily on BICLA response at week 52 as treatment differences using this measurement were consistent across both trials,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> and BICLA offers a comprehensive independent assessment of all organs.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Other end points assessed were time to sustained BICLA response, SLE Responder Index ≥4 (SRI(4)) at week 52,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> sustained oral glucocorticoid taper to ≤7.5 mg/day from week 40 to week 52 in patients receiving ≥10 mg/day at baseline (prednisone or equivalent), ≥50% reduction in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index Activity score (CLASI-A)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> at week 12 in patients with baseline CLASI-A ≥10, ≥50% reduction from baseline in swollen and tender joint counts at week 52 in patients with ≥6 swollen and ≥6 tender joints at baseline, annualised flare rate through week 52 and percentage change from baseline to week 52 in serological markers.</p>
                <p>Responses from baseline to week 52 in patient-reported outcomes were assessed using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F, &gt;3-point improvement)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and Short Form 36 Health Survey, V.2 (SF-36)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores (&gt;3.4 and &gt;4.6 improvement, respectively).

The annualised flare rate was calculated using a negative binomial regression model, which included covariates of treatment group, stratification factors and study, and was adjusted for exposure time. For pooled data assessments, responders from both studies were classified according to the TULIP-2 restricted medication analytic rules. All p values are nominal.</p>

                <p>For IFNGS-high patients, anifrolumab was also associated with favourable treatment differences versus placebo across other efficacy end points; results were comparable or greater than those in the total patient population when analysed by SRI(4) (nominal p&lt;0.001), sustained oral glucocorticoid taper (nominal p&lt;0.001), ≥50% reduction in CLASI-A score (nominal p=0.002), ≥50% reduction in swollen/tender joint counts (nominal p=0.054) and annualised flare rate (nominal p=0.005) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).

                <p>A greater proportion of IFNGS-high patients treated with anifrolumab had functional improvement from baseline to week 52, using end points defined by FACIT-F (&gt;3-point improvement), SF-36 MCS (&gt;4.6-point improvement) and SF-36 PCS (&gt;3.4-point improvement), compared with IFNGS-high patients treated with placebo (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). These results were comparable to those seen in the overall patient population. In IFNGS-low patients, none of these measures reached nominal significance, although there was a trend towards greater proportions of the anifrolumab group with improvements in FACIT-F and SF-36 PCS, but not SF-36 MCS, compared with the placebo group.</p>

              <p>In these analyses using pooled TULIP data, we reported efficacy and safety of anifrolumab in key predefined subgroups of patients with SLE categorised by IFNGS, demographic and clinical features. The TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials were not designed or powered to evaluate the benefits and risks of anifrolumab in each predefined subgroup, apart from the IFNGS-high subgroup. Rather, the studies were designed to demonstrate treatment benefit in the overall population of patients with moderate-to-severe SLE despite receiving standard therapy, in whom anifrolumab was efficacious across multiple end points. In order to test whether the overall treatment benefit was generally uniform, we conducted these analyses across the predefined subgroups. These analyses showed that the treatment benefit with anifrolumab across most demographic and clinical subgroups was consistent with that observed in the overall population; however, the small sample sizes in a few subgroups limited the conclusions that could be drawn. The greatest discrimination from placebo was observed in IFNGS-high patients and those with abnormal serological markers. Anifrolumab safety was similar across most subgroups. As previously reported, herpes zoster incidence, an AESI in the TULIP trials, was similar in patients with and without an elevated IFNGS and across most other subgroups analysed.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20 31</xref>
</p>
              <p>The treatment differences between anifrolumab and placebo were greater in IFNGS-high patients than in IFNGS-low patients across most clinical end points, including BICLA response, oral glucocorticoid tapers, annualised flare rate and CLASI-A response. This could have partly been driven by the difference between subgroups in the response rates in the placebo group (who just received standard therapy). Overall, the response rates in the placebo group were lower in the IFNGS-high subgroup than in the IFNGS-low subgroup, perhaps owing to the documented association between elevated IFNGS and greater disease activity.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 32 33</xref> Therefore, IFNGS may distinguish patients with SLE with similar clinical phenotypes but who have different immunopathogenesis appropriate for different treatments.</p>
              <p>Most subgroups showed a treatment benefit with anifrolumab for one or more of the efficacy end points analysed. Although a numerical benefit was observed for some subgroups (eg, IFNGS-low patients, males, patients aged ≥65 years, the ‘rest of world’ region and patients with paediatric-onset SLE), small sample sizes prevented conclusions from being drawn regarding the benefit of anifrolumab; further investigation with larger numbers of patients would be required to do so.</p>
              <p>As previously reported, the IFNGS-high population was less likely to have severe musculoskeletal disease activity than IFNGS-low patients, with fewer active, swollen and/or tender joints at baseline.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> Here, the proportion of patients with ≥6 swollen and ≥6 tender joints at baseline who had a ≥50% reduction in active joint count at week 52 was similar for IFNGS-high and IFNGS-low patients treated with anifrolumab; however, placebo joint count responses were lower in IFNGS-low patients than in IFNGS-high patients. This difference in placebo response might be caused by differences in immunopathology between IFNGS-high and IFNGS-low patients; however, immunopathogenesis of lupus joint manifestations is complex. Local production of different IFN-I subtypes in target organs may have potentially complex local effects on tissue inflammation, which may not be captured by measurement of IFNGS in the circulation.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 36–38</xref> In addition, accurate clinical assessment of musculoskeletal inflammation and response in SLE is challenging; musculoskeletal imaging may be required to elucidate this further.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39–41</xref>
</p>
              <p>Associations between ancestry, treatment response and long-term disease burden have been observed in patients with SLE receiving standard therapies, with greater oral glucocorticoid use and organ damage in African or Asian ancestry compared with European ancestry patients.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 42</xref> Ancestry has also been associated with response to immunosuppressive and biological therapies.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 43 44</xref> However, in our analysis, anifrolumab demonstrated treatment benefits in patients of different ancestries and from different regions, with higher BICLA response rates seen in Asian ancestry patients. Both African and Asian ancestry patients (predominantly from East Asia) were also more likely to be IFNGS-high than European ancestry patients, consistent with previous findings.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45–47</xref>
</p>
              <p>The main limitation of this post hoc analysis was the relatively small number of patients in some subgroups, including the IFNGS-low, male, age ≥65 years and paediatric-onset SLE subgroups, although this distribution of patients reflects the natural distribution among patients with moderate-to-severe SLE.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16 26</xref> Our results were assessed in a clinical trial patient population with specific eligibility criteria that was broadly representative of patients with moderate-to-severe SLE in the real-world population; however, the results might not apply to all patients with SLE. The four genes measured to classify IFNGS status were selected a priori and do not represent an unbiased, genome-wide screen of all IFN-I-related genes. We also cannot discount the possibility that the binary IFNGS test may not detect low grade or less common types of IFN dysregulation. However, the 4-gene IFNGS is a validated and well-characterised measure of IFN-I activity that associated strongly with IFN-α protein expression and the continuous 21-gene IFNGS in the phase IIb MUSE trial.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> In this analysis, IFNGS expression at screening was accounted for in the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach used to calculate response rates and to compare responses between treatment groups. Therefore, a confounding effect of IFNGS expression on the interpretation of results across other clinical subgroups would be unlikely.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, treatment with anifrolumab was associated with beneficial responses across efficacy end points and was well tolerated in patients with moderate-to-severe SLE who were receiving standard therapy. These findings were generally consistent across a range of demographic and clinical subgroups; in a few subgroups, we could not draw conclusions regarding the treatment benefit with anifrolumab because of small sample sizes. Subgroups with increased baseline serological markers and/or an elevated IFNGS derived greater benefit from anifrolumab treatment, in line with the targeted mechanism of action. Overall, the findings of this study merit further exploration, and suggest that anifrolumab has a consistent efficacy and safety profile across a range of patients with moderate-to-severe SLE.</p>
