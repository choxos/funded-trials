                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services improve health outcomes for young people with psychosis in the mediumâ€“long term, but 25% of young people disengage in the first 12â€‰months with costs to their mental health, families, society and the NHS. This study will evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and implementation of a team-based motivational Early Youth Engagement (EYE-2) intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The study design is a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) with economic evaluation, comparing the EYE-2 intervention + standardised EIP service to standardised EIP service alone, with randomisation at the team level. A process evaluation will evaluate the delivery of the intervention qualitatively and quantitatively across contexts.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The setting is 20 EIP teams in 5 sites: Manchester, South London, East Anglia, Thames Valley and Hampshire. Participants are young people (14â€“35â€‰years) with first episode psychosis, and EIP staff.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">The intervention is the team-based motivational engagement (EYE-2) intervention, delivered alongside standardised EIP services, and supported by additional training, website, booklets and social groups. The comparator is the standardised EIP service. Both interventions are delivered by EIP clinicians.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">The primary outcome is time to disengagement (time in days from date of allocation to care coordinator to date of last contact following refusal to engage with EIP service, or lack of response to EIP contact for a consecutive 3-month period). Secondary outcomes include mental and physical health, deaths, social and occupational function, recovery, satisfaction and service use at 6, 12, 18 and 24â€‰months.</p>
                  <p id="Par6">A 12-month within-trial economic evaluation will investigate cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective and from an NHS perspective.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par7">The trial will provide the first test of an engagement intervention in standardised care, with the potential for significant impact on the mental health and wellbeing of young people and their families, and economic benefits for services. The intervention will be highly scalable, supported by the toolkit including manuals, commissioning guide, training and resources, adapted to meet the needs of the diverse EIP population, and based on an in-depth process evaluation.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par46">In England, 1â€“2% of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] or 7500 new young people each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] develop psychosis. Psychosis can have devastating consequences, with significantly poorer quality of life and high disability adjusted life year losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. People with psychosis die up to 25â€‰years earlier than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], one third from suicide, usually within the first 3â€“5â€‰years from diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The first 2â€“3â€‰years are pivotal in determining long-term trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services are pro-active, person-centred mental health services offering early detection and treatment in this critical 3-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The recent Access and Waiting Time Standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], published in 2016 by NHS England, require that Clinical Commissioning Groups offer a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concordant EIP service within 2â€‰weeks from referral for all new emerging psychosis cases in England.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Despite these guidelines, treatment disengagement from services is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]: estimated at 30% of young people in a recent systematic review across all service types and follow-up periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and 25% within the first 12â€‰months in standalone EIP services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], including in our own pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This is a significant problem. National policy, investment and service structure are focused on ensuring that young people are proactively engaged in assessment and offered a full EIP care package to prevent them â€˜falling through the gapsâ€™, receiving inadequate care, poor outcomes and greater subsequent healthcare use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but 1 in 4 disengage. There is limited evidence for methods to promote engagement in the subsequent 3Â years. Our work has begun to provide this evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We now understand why people disengage and are testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a team-based motivational engagement intervention to reduce disengagement from EIP services.</p>
                <p id="Par48">There is sustained interest in increasing access to EIP services for people of all ages who develop a first episode of psychosis, and a clear need to prevent disengagement. Engagement with EIP services leads to increased service user satisfaction, fewer symptoms, relapses and hospital admissions, better health, wellbeing, social and occupational function and fewer suicides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] in the medium to long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Disengagement of young people with psychosis represents a significant cost to their health and wellbeing and impacts on families, society and the NHS. There is an expressed need from researchers and NHS management to focus on engagement, with some researchers suggesting it is the most important outcome of EIP services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The College Centre for Quality Improvement has made time to disengagement a recent EIP audit requirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, Access and Waiting Time Standards are supported by NHS England, who are committed to further access and engagement targets up to 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. EIP service access is â€˜a clear national priority for the NHSâ€™, and local NHS services must include EIP development in their immediate and long-term sustainability and transformation plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This commitment has been supported by Â£70 million for staff and training to 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Yet disengagement from these services threatens the quality of health outcomes and nullifies this investment for 25% of young people. The financial cost of psychosis to society, including healthcare, families, unemployment and death, is estimated at Â£11.8 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. EIP services demonstrate savings of 30â€“50% over standard care, over periods of at least 8â€‰years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]; Â£5000 per person per year based on days in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; Â£7972 net savings per person after 4â€‰years, Â£6870 in the next 4â€“10â€‰years and Â£15 for every Â£1 spent on EIP services after 10â€‰years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Even with suboptimal engagement, EIP is estimated to result in Â£63 million of savings per year to society, Â£34 million of these to the NHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">Our initial Early Youth Engagement (EYE) project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] developed a team-based motivational engagement intervention, drawing on views of service users and their families of barriers and facilitators to engagement, and on literature that disengagement is linked to younger age, substance use, coping styles, family contact and knowledge of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To date, limited evidence from our own work identifies strategies to maintain engagement from initial assessment or when a young person begins to disengage. Our Delphi consultation with clinicians and managers reached consensus on the EYE intervention and resources that were both important and feasible to deliver, based on the views of young people and their families. Our pilot study found that service disengagement decreased from 24% prior- to 14.5% post-EYE intervention. Qualitative data from service users, families and staff revealed improvements in personal recovery (social inclusion, hope, trust, practical goals) and engagement (communication, collaboration, family involvement). Families reported feeling more reassured that they knew how to support their young person, and staff felt more pride and professionalism in their service due to having access to high-quality resources and information.</p>
                <p id="Par50">However, the original EYE pilot study was conducted on only 298 service users, and whilst it showed promising results in reducing disengagement, the pre- and post-intervention comparison methodology was not designed to formally assess the effectiveness of the intervention. There was no evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and limited evaluation of implementation.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The current protocol presents the methodology of a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and implementation of the team-based motivational engagement intervention aimed at reducing disengagement from EIP servicesâ€”the EYE-2 project.</p>

                <p id="Par76">Service user inclusion criteria are as follows: (i) consecutive referrals to the EIP team during the study recruitment period (ii) aged 14â€“35; (iii) meeting criteria for a first episode of psychosis (FEP): (F20-F29; F31 ICD-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] as determined by each local service according to their own established criteria. The inclusion criteria used to make these decisions will be recorded for each service and reported for subsequent inspection. Exclusion criteria are (i) a sub-threshold â€˜at risk mental stateâ€™, not meeting FEP criteria, (ii) referral over the age of 35, (iii) referrals where there is remaining diagnostic uncertainty about psychosis at 12â€‰months and (iv) service exclusion criteria such as organic or intoxication induced psychosis and specific exclusions.</p>

                <title>Who will take informed consent? {26a}</title>
                <p id="Par78">This study presents unique challenges as the primary â€˜disengagementâ€™ outcome has the potential to impact disproportionately on data completeness in those who are disengaging, who are the least likely to consent. A standard approach of receiving individual informed consent and providing commensurate reimbursement for time is likely to impact on robust data completion. As a result, this intervention will be primarily evaluated using routinely available and routinely collected service data. Data will be collated by the EIP Research Assistant (RA) who will work as part of the clinical team and will transfer anonymised service data to the research team. The study will be widely publicised within each team to all those who are eligible and defined as part of the research cohort. They will receive a study information leaflet, contact details for the trial, promotional material and a pack of local support service information, as recommended by our Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group. Any service user who requests that their data are not used will be withdrawn from the trial. All remaining service user data will be included.</p>
                <p id="Par79">Service users will be contacted directly for the purpose of collecting a small amount of additional questionnaire data, as part of a research process in which informed consent will be taken, either (i) if a service user has disengaged completely and routine service data are not available or (ii) at the 12-month assessment when non-routine health economic data are collected. In these cases, a member of the clinical team or the clinical RA will make the first contact. All service users who are willing will then be contacted by the study RA who will take informed consent for completion of questionnaire data and will provide Â£20 remuneration for their time.</p>
                <p id="Par80">For the process evaluation, all EIP clinicians will be invited to take part by the clinical RA. They will be provided with an information and consent sheet in advance and will provide written informed consent prior to the process evaluation.</p>

                  <p id="Par82">The current EIP care pathway is variable nationally in adherence to the EIP model, with standalone, hub and spoke services, and specialist workers in community teams. Standalone services that adhere to the EIP model have the best outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and recent investment and targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] mean many services are moving to this model. All services involved in the current study are standardised in that they are standalone services, adherent to the EIP model core principles of (i) early detection, (ii) assertive engagement, (iii) person and recovery focus, (iv) family focus, (v) work with diagnostic uncertainty, (vi) positive risk-taking and (vii) provision of NICE-recommended interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par83">We have selected the standardised EIP pathway as the comparison condition because it is the nationally recommended care pathway for people in England who develop a first episode of severe mental illness (psychosis). Delivery of this pathway and routine outcome measures (HoNOS; QPR; DIALOG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] are mandated by NHS England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The EIP service model and suite of NICE-recommended interventions are clearly defined. Training and monitoring will ensure that administration and recording of measures and intervention provision is undertaken in the EIP pathway in a robust, standardised way across sites.</p>

The training will last 1.5â€‰days. Core sessions include (i) introduction to the EYE-2 intervention and resources, (ii) the value of hopeful care coordination, (iii) goal-focussed care planning, (iv) service user-led introduction to honest open communication, (v) carers rights and protocol for engaging family and friends, (vi) peer workers and social groups, (vii) motivational interviewing for goal-focussed engagement, (viii) applying open communication approaches in the context of risk, mental health exacerbations, treatment and admissions, (ix) the implementation process and local implementation plans and (x) the research processâ€”ethics, consent, promotion and awareness raising. Two rounds of each training are offered at each site, at least 1Â month apart, to enable staff to attend whilst maintaining service delivery, and to accommodate leave and absence. A preparation and consolidation phase of up to 1Â month will allow final preparations for RCT start. Additional booster training will be offered approximately 6-monthly throughout the intervention, with content being informed by feedback collected in earlier training, in the qualitative interviews, and from staff at study sites.</p>

                  <title>Data collection methods</title>
                  <p id="Par120">There are 3 main methods of data collection in this study that have been specifically designed to maximise data completeness (<italic>see</italic> Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). First, primary outcome data are recorded routinely by the service, but collated by the RA working within the EIP service and transferred anonymously to the research team (disengagement and service use data, as well as data on use of NICE interventions). The primary outcome of time to disengagement will be calculated by the blinded RA who will determine date of disengagement (date of last contact with the team) and calculate the number of days from allocation to care coordinator to disengagement using casenote data provided by the EIP RA, who will double check the data using the same process, and any discrepancies will be resolved in discussion with the study team. Second, there are data that are routinely collected by EIP clinicians but collated by the researchers (HoNOS; QPR; DIALOG) and transferred anonymously to the study team. These researchers in their role with the team will also collect additional missing routine data. Finally, where routine data are missing at 12â€‰months, for cost-effectiveness data (AD-SUS), and for routine data from those who disengage, a standard informed consent process will be taken prior to data collection as described above, and data including HoNOS, QPR and DIALOG will be collected by telephone or in person. If the service user prefers to complete the questionnaires by telephone, consent will be noted by the researcher, after which the researcher will conduct the HoNOS using a semi-structured interview developed for this purpose in collaboration with the Patient and Public Involvement team, as well as the QPR, the DIALOG and the AD-SUS at 12â€‰months. If service users prefer to complete the data in person, then written informed consent will be taken, a convenient public space will be agreed to meet to complete the measures, and the same process will be followed. Participants will be reimbursed Â£20 for their time in cash, or as an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> voucher. If at any point the participant asks to stop taking part, this will be noted and the interview will be stopped. If the participant asks not to be contacted again regarding the study, this too will be noted, and they will not be contacted again. We will record the nature of data collection (clinician, telephone assessment or case note screen) for all outcomes.</p>
                  <p id="Par121">Engagement and service use data will be captured continuously from case notes. Secondary routine clinician-rated (HoNOS) and patient-reported (QPR/DIALOG) questionnaire data will be collected at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24â€‰months. Baseline will comprise the first âˆ’â€‰4 to +â€‰6â€‰weeks to allow for baseline assessments in hospital immediately prior to EIP allocation; follow-up data will be collected at each time point âˆ’â€‰2/+â€‰4â€‰weeks. The study will include a 12-month recruitment period and an additional maximum 12-month follow-up period. Those who enter the study at the start of the cohort will be followed up for 24â€‰months, whilst those who enter at the end of the cohort will be followed up for 12Â months.</p>

                  <p id="Par122">An initial half-day training will be provided for clinicians in both EYE-2 and control teams at each site on robust data collection and recording. This will be supported by a data collection manual and coloured user-friendly questionnaire packs and resources. The training will include (i) team values and data collection, (ii) an introduction to the questionnaires, (iii) identifying and overcoming barriers to data collection, (iv) clinically meaningful use in care planning (v) top tips and resources to support implementation. This training programme has been adopted by NHS England and translated into an e-learning package for all EIP services <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/early-intervention-in-psychosis/">https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/early-intervention-in-psychosis/</ext-link>. It is incorporated into current National Clinical Audit of Psychosis outcomes training. The full training package will thus be 1/2 a day on robust data collection training for control sites and a 2-day training to include also the EYE-2 training at intervention sites.</p>

                  <p id="Par125">Process evaluation questionnaire data will be collected from all consenting clinicians at 3 time points (start, middle, end) during intervention delivery. The questionnaires will take 20â€“30â€‰min and can be completed online by email link, or by telephone, or in person, at an NHS base or elsewhere local to the clinician. All clinicians and managers in each intervention team will be invited to complete the process evaluation questionnaires. A random sub-sample of at least 2 clinicians and 1 manager at each of the 10 intervention services (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰33â€“40) will also complete a brief semi-structured interview to explore barriers and facilitators to intervention delivery including context and turbulence at 3 time points, with at least 10 participants completing each time point of beginning, middle and end of the intervention. Each clinician will be interviewed in a face-to-face or telephone individual interview with a clinical EIP researcher from another site, at a time and place that is convenient to them. The interview will take 20â€“30â€‰mins and will be audio-taped for subsequent transcription. It will be guided by the process evaluation topic guide. The process evaluation topic guide will be informed by Normalisation Process Theory and the logic model for EYE-2.</p>

                <p id="Par145">Research suggests that follow-up rates are improved by using shorter assessments, reminding service users about subsequent follow-up, updating contact details, providing reimbursement, and utilising RAs to collect additional data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. We have incorporated all of these approaches into the current strategy. Patient-reported outcomes are brief (approximately 15â€‰min, 25â€‰min including the Adult Service Use Schedule) and can be completed by telephone. Participants will be advised that they may be contacted and will be reimbursed Â£20 for their participation. The maximum follow-up rate of 8 questionnaire assessments per RA per week if no data are available routinely is achievable based on previous research in these sites. The use of routine outcome data will reduce the risk of disproportionate data loss for participants who are minimally engaged.</p>

Employment outcomes (including absenteeism or employment gained or lost) will be valued using the â€˜human capitalâ€™ approach (using occupational pay rates to value time spent in or out of paid or unpaid work).

Questionnaire data will be used to produce scores for implementation (use of EYE-2 resources with service users) which will be analysed using mixed regression analysis of all non-missing data (valid if outcomes are â€˜missing at randomâ€™), with a random effect for service and a Kenward-Roger small-sample correction to explore changes in scores over time, for implementation of the EYE-2 intervention through core mechanisms of coherence, cognitive participation, collective action and reflexive monitoring. Secondary analyses will be conducted to investigate whether the intervention effect is mediated by adherence and context. Outcomes across sites will be investigated in relation to turbulence (macrolevel stressors, complexity and changes within the NHS) over time. Qualitative interview data will explore implementation, barriers, facilitators, contextual effects and turbulence in the service (macro stressors, complexity, change) over time. Qualitative data will be analysed using constant comparative analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and interpreted in the light of Normalisation Process Theory.</p>

                <title>Adverse event reporting and harms {22}</title>
                <p id="Par168">A trial-specific SOP has been written for the monitoring and reporting of adverse events in this trial. This trial is unusual in that it is a pragmatic cluster trial which includes the entire cohort of 20 EIP services in England for 1Â year, followed up for a further year. It is therefore expected that there will be a very large number of serious adverse events (SAEs) due to the natural fluctuation in severity of psychosis experiences in this population, and the intervention itself is a comparatively low risk social, motivational and psychoeducation intervention. For this reason, it was decided to take a pragmatic approach to reporting of adverse events; this has been discussed with the trial management team and DMEC, and follows the approach used in a previous cluster RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Clinicians and clinical link persons (team leader or clinical psychologist) in each team will raise to the research team any SAE that is deemed to be possibly, probably or definitely related to the trial, for further action. Seriousness is defined using standard criteria as (1) resulting in death; (2) is life threatening (only including self-harm or suicide ideation or suicide attempt requiring hospitalisation or serious threat or act of harm to others); (3) requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation (only in the case of suicide ideation grade 4 or suicide attempt grade 4 or 5 as according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 November 2017, or serious threat or act of harm to others requiring hospitalisation; (4) resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. Relatedness criteria include (1) distress caused by contents of booklet or website; (2) distress or fatigue caused by answering questionnaires or taking part in interviews; (3) disappointment at being allocated to the control group; (4) distress related to the involvement with or breach of confidentiality related to involvement of a non-standard member of the social network such as friend or other non-family member; (5) distress triggered by attendance at an EYE-2 social group; (6) distress caused by concern about data security in the trial (routine data/posts on the forum); (7) distress caused by a response to a post on the forum or other forum content; (8) other as deemed by site. Events that are not serious or not related to the trial (adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), unexpected adverse event (UAE), adverse reaction (AR)) will require no further action. Any event rated as at least possibly serious and possibly related will be reported immediately to the EIP RA who will gather additional information and complete a draft serious adverse reaction (SAR) form on the same day and email this to the CTU and site PI. The site PI will reassess causality and expectedness and the CTU will send the information to the CI. Participants will be followed up until clinical recovery is complete, or until the event has resolved, and information reported on the final SAR report. In the absence of the PI, the form should be completed and signed by another trained member of the site trial team who is named on the delegation log (as designated by local PI). The PI should subsequently check the SAR form, make changes as appropriate, sign and then send to the Brighton and Sussex CTU as soon as possible. The patient must be identified by trial number. The patientâ€™s name should not be used on any correspondence. This final SAR report is then graded SAR or suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) on the basis of expectedness judged by the PI and CI. The CTU will notify the research ethics committee of SUSARs as per the conditions of the favourable opinion and according to CTUSOP018 within 15 calendar days of the CTU first being notified of the event. The CI and independent clinical reviewer will assess any possible SARs. Events recorded as serious, related and expected (SAR) will be submitted to the DMEC and sponsor as required. Any events rated as also unexpected (SUSAR) will also be reported to the REC within 15â€‰days of first notice. This may involve the DMEC members being unblinded to the trial group or seeking further data. If there are any ethical or safety reasons why the trial should be prematurely ended, they will advise the TSC accordingly.</p>

Participants will be able to provide comments and suggestions for dissemination. All national services will be invited to a results launch event, which will be recorded and added to the study website, along with other outputs. The implementation toolkit will be formed into a series of implementation packages, tailored to different contexts, including training, manuals, checklists, website, booklets, schools pack and social involvement protocols. These will be made available to clinicians, managers and services to support delivery in the NHS. A broader package of learning, relating to implementation in youth and mental health services, will be made available for other youth and psychosis services (NHS and non-statutory). The commissioning guide, developed with our GP commissioner, will be provided for commissioning purposes. Our collaboration with NHS England EIP lead (JN) will allow us to adapt approaches and materials during the study, and release these to support and guide future NHS England targets. We will present our findings to the public, participants, services and academic audiences through the Sussex Psychosis Research Interest Group, and other site-specific and local feedback events, national and international conferences. We will draw on our national collaborations, and regional links, so that if effective, we can readily disseminate the outcomes of this study, and guidance for implementation to all EIP teams in England, alongside the manuals, and commissioner guidance. A series of Tweet chats involving national and international colleagues, offered to services throughout the UK, will support further implementation planning. Researchers, clinicians and services will thus be kept informed and able to use new information regarding (i) the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention; (ii) the engagement needs of ethnic minority EIP populations and (iii) variations in implementation and outcomes based on NHS service context, turbulence, macro and micro stressors. Service users and families will thus, in a timely manner, receive engagement-focussed services, supported by â€˜myth-bustingâ€™ resources that address their personal goals and needs.</p>
                <p id="Par172">EIP services throughout the UK will be supported to implement the EYE intervention. The results of the study, if effective and cost-effective, will be widely disseminated through our network of regional and national channels, to clinicians, services, trusts and CCGs, supported by NHS England. We will offer a set of training and implementation packages tailored to different contexts and services, including manuals, resources and commissioner guides. The Normalisation Process Theory framework will enable us to lay out specific changes that will be required in terms of roles and responsibilities, beliefs, behaviours, relationships, processes and structures to deliver the EYE-2 approach at an individual, social network, service and NHS trust level. This will enable a real and meaningful change in how individuals work and services are delivered, based on core EYE intervention principles.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par173">Over the past 20â€‰years, significant gains have been made nationally and internationally in ensuring that early detection and intervention services are available for young people who develop psychosis for the first time, and their families. Substantial recent investment has helped to reduce waiting times to 2Â weeks from referral to allocation to a care coordinator, for the majority of cases, as well as ensuring that EIP service provision is equipped with a full range of NICE-recommended treatment options. Yet approximately 25% of young people disengage prematurely without receiving the full benefit of these services and at significant potential cost to their mental health. Whilst strategies are in place to support engagement with an assessment process, there are no interventions aimed at improving engagement in the longer term, and as young people begin to disengage.</p>
              <p id="Par174">The EYE-2 trial is the first to evaluate a specific engagement-focussed intervention for young people with psychosis. The pragmatic cluster RCT design will evaluate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The use of NHS England mandated outcomes serves to strengthen follow-up data completion, across the whole sample, including for those who are disengaging. The implementation process evaluation, delivery through routine clinical service structures and provision of an implementation tool kit, training programme and resources will ensure that the intervention is highly scalable and will distinguish it from standard EIP care. Staff responses to the process evaluation and booster training will ensure that the intervention can be adapted to suit a variety of service structures, clinician needs and preferences, both within and beyond EIP.</p>
              <p id="Par175">Patient and public involvement (PPI) has been integral to the conduct, intervention and resource development in the original EYE project and PPI continues to be integral to the current study design. PPI will be led from the McPin Foundation (specialists in mental health service user research). PPI activities will include (i) contribution to steering group and study meetings; (ii) reviewing ethics, recruitment and advertising materials; (iii) supporting training delivery at each site; (iv) supporting the delivery of the social groups at each intervention site; (v) co-facilitating the lived experience group at each site; (vi) contributing to the dissemination plan. In each site, the senior PPI lead, 2 service users and a parent will be involved in the local EYE-2 staff training and EYE-2 social group programme. The entire PPI team will contribute to articles, VLOGS and study newsletters. All of this previous and planned work will ensure that the intervention and materials remain highly valued by clinicians, service users and their families and that service users continue to feel they have more choices, enhanced goals, increased hope, trust and quality of life.</p>
