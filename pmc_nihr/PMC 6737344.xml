                <p>Previously, using fMRI, we demonstrated lower connectivity between right anterior superior temporal (ATL) and anterior subgenual cingulate (SCC) regions while patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience guilt. This neural signature was detected despite symptomatic remission which suggested a putative role in vulnerability. This randomised controlled double-blind parallel group clinical trial investigated whether patients with MDD are able to voluntarily modulate this neural signature. To this end, we developed a fMRI neurofeedback software (FRIEND), which measures ATL-SCC coupling and displays its levels in real time. Twenty-eight patients with remitted MDD were randomised to two groups, each receiving one session of fMRI neurofeedback whilst retrieving guilt and indignation/anger-related autobiographical memories. They were instructed to feel the emotion whilst trying to increase the level of a thermometer-like display on a screen. Active intervention group: The thermometer levels increased with increasing levels of ATL-SCC correlations in the guilt condition. Control intervention group: The thermometer levels decreased when correlation levels deviated from the previous baseline level in the guilt condition, thus reinforcing stable correlations. Both groups also received feedback during the indignation condition reinforcing stable correlations. We confirmed our predictions that patients in the active intervention group were indeed able to increase levels of ATL-SCC correlations for guilt vs. indignation and their self-esteem after training compared to before training and that this differed significantly from the control intervention group. These data provide proof-of-concept for a novel treatment target for MDD patients and are in keeping with the hypothesis that ATL-SCC connectivity plays a key role in self-worth.</p>

              <p id="p0030">FMRI neurofeedback provides individuals access to information about their current local brain activity that is usually outside of their awareness. This potentially mitigates a shortcoming of cognitive therapy (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1979</xref>) for major depressive disorder (MDD) which relies on information that patients are consciously aware of. FMRI neurofeedback further enables probing causal relationships between local brain function and psychological symptoms in MDD. Here, we used this approach to probe the role of functional connectivity between the right superior anterior temporal (ATL) and the subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC) in overgeneralised self-blaming emotional biases and MDD vulnerability. The influential revised learned helplessness model (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abramson et al., 1978</xref>) states that vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) is due to a bias to blame oneself for failure in an overgeneralised way resulting in decreased global self-esteem and depression and this is consistent with the phenomenology and coherence of MDD symptoms (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Zahn et al., 2015b</xref>) and the effectiveness of cognitive therapy which focuses on self-critical thinking (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1979</xref>). Overgeneralised self-blame is associated with excessive self-blaming emotions (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2013</xref>) (e.g., feeling “guilty for everything” or “hating oneself in general”) and worthlessness. So far, fMRI neurofeedback interventions for MDD have been designed, however, on the basis of a model that proposes an overall increase in negative and reduction in positive emotions (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 1988a</xref>) rather than self-blame-selective increases in negative emotions.</p>
              <p id="p0035">(<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Linden et al., 2012</xref>) showed in their pioneering but non-randomised trial that fMRI neurofeedback can reduce depressive symptoms in current MDD when reinforcing activation in brain regions responding to positive pictures. In a recent randomised controlled trial, they confirmed these findings, although similar levels of improvement were observed in the active neurofeedback control group (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Mehler et al., 2018</xref>). (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2014</xref>) have developed an approach based on reinforcing amygdala activation in response to positive autobiographical memories. This method has recently been probed in current MDD in a pilot double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT), exhibiting superiority in reducing depressive symptoms versus a control neurofeedback intervention that reinforces parietal cortex activation (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2017</xref>). Another study showed a decrease in negative emotions on decreasing activation in salience-related brain regions including the amygdala in response to negative pictures in depression (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0040">We recently provided evidence that reduced positive memory biases, as successfully targeted in previous neurofeedback studies (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), were only present in a subgroup of people with MDD. It was only those patients with early life stress who had reduced positive memory biases and these were associated with number of previous episodes, suggesting their role in “scarring” which may increase future vulnerability (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gethin et al., 2017</xref>). This indicates that neurofeedback interventions targeting positive memories may be most effective in MDD patients with early life stress. So far, however, fMRI neurofeedback interventions aimed at self-blaming emotional biases in MDD, shown to be independent from general negative emotional biases (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Zahn et al., 2015a</xref>), are lacking.</p>
              <p id="p0045">In this double-blind RCT we sought to establish proof-of-concept for a neurofeedback approach aimed at self-blame-selective reductions in functional connectivity (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2013</xref>) between the right superior anterior temporal (ATL) and subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC), previously identified as a signature of overgeneralised self-blaming emotions in MDD (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2012</xref>). This signature was found in patients with remitted MDD (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2012</xref>), known to have an increased vulnerability towards MDD (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Eaton et al., 2008</xref>). Functional disconnection of the ATL and SCC was found while people felt guilty during fMRI relative to feeling indignation. We sought to determine whether self-blame-selective disconnection on fMRI can be detected and fed back to the participants after a short temporal delay with real-time fMRI and whether connectivity can be increased through neurofeedback training in people with remitted MDD.

Minimisation was implemented by first using random assignment to the two groups and then assigning further patients to the group which minimizes group differences in running totals for mean age and gender distribution. Minimisation was carried out by Sebastian Hoefle, an IDOR employee who was not part of the research team and had no access to participant data apart from participant ID, age and gender information. After carrying out the minimised random allocation, he saved the allocation in a text file which he uploaded onto the FRIEND server directly, thereby assuring concealment from the research team.

First and fourth runs consisted of four blocks of guilt and four blocks of indignation memories (15 volumes per block), interspersed with eight mental subtraction condition blocks (10 volumes each). The second and third run were identical, and participants were provided with visual feedback for training during these runs. The neurofeedback runs consisted of 360 volumes with 120 volumes for guilt and 120 for indignation distributed over 4 blocks (30 volumes per block) which were interspersed with 8 blocks (15 volumes) of mental subtraction (120 volumes) by serial subtraction of seven from a 3-digit number (for a graphical depiction see Supplemental Fig. 6). Mental subtraction was used to allow patients to distract themselves emotionally from the scenarios and to decrease, so-called “resting-state” activity known to be present in the SCC (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bado et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

All steps described above employed native FSL codes, within a pipeline that enabled improved processing speed (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2013</xref>). Signal-level normalization was performed by subtracting the mean value of the voxel signals within the ROI over the entire preceding subtraction condition block from the current echo-planar images belonging to the guilt or indignation condition block, which minimizes local signal trends. The right ATL and SCC ROI masks in MNI space were warped to subject space by using the inverse transform of the FSL-FLIRT algorithm (affine, 12-parameters). ATL (4 mm radius sphere around centre coordinate: MNI x = 58, y = 0, z = −12) and SCC ROIs (6 mm radius sphere around centre coordinate: MNI x = −4, y = 23, z = −5) were defined by using previously described a priori anatomical ROIs ((<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2012</xref>), see Supplementary Information), smoothed with 6 mm FWHM), and back-transformed into native space to then select the 10% most activated voxels in the native space ROI, this may have led to different sizes in the ROIs across subjects in native space which we were not able to control for. The activation was calculated using the contrast between guilt vs. subtraction in the ATL ROI, and guilt vs indignation in the SCC ROI. The first 5 volumes of each emotional block were discarded due to high correlations guided by decreases in time series after subtraction conditions. A moving target correlation algorithm was employed by using a sliding time window based on the last 10 volumes, updated every two seconds (i.e. for each volume). The level of the colour bar of the visual feedback signal (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a&amp;b) was determined on the basis of the size of the Pearson correlation coefficient measured over the last 10 volumes (weighted by a sigmoid function, see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1) in relation to the minimum and maximum.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1|</label><caption><p>Panel a&amp;b) Thermometer-like displays were used for visual feedback.

The reason why we have chosen a different approach here for our imaging data is, because we have two related imaging outcome measures (guilt and indignation) which we sought to contrast against each other, but also look at separately. To realise this in an ANCOVA, we would have had to use a Multivariate ANCOVA with 7 predictors to model all the interactions between baseline connectivity and intervention group. With an n of 28 this would have entailed a massive overfitting problem, rendering the model probably not reproducible (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Stevens, 2009</xref>).</p>

                <p id="p0205">Further secondary analyses considering pre-training differences between groups in ATL-SCC connectivity (see Supplementary Results), confirmed our primary analysis that the ACTIVE group showed higher post-training ATL-SCC regression effects for guilt vs. indignation compared with the CONTROL group. Furthermore, this secondary analysis showed that this result was associated with the interaction of intervention group and pre-training ATL-SCC regression effects. This interaction effect was driven by a negative association of pre-training with post-training ATL-SCC regression effects for guilt vs. indignation in the ACTIVE group and a positive association in the CONTROL group. This indicated that patients in the ACTIVE group with low connectivity between the ATL and SCC for guilt vs. indignation prior to neurofeedback training were more likely to increase the levels of connectivity through training when compared with those who had high levels of connectivity prior to training already. The positive association of pre-training and post-training ATL-SCC connectivity in the CONTROL group reflected that the control intervention was aimed at stabilising pre-training levels of connectivity. Further, these secondary analyses showed that the weak trendwise neurofeedback-training effect difference between intervention groups on ATL-SCC regression coefficients for indignation in our primary data analysis disappeared when correcting for pre-training differences in ATL-SCC connectivity for indignation.</p>

              <p id="p0230">We confirmed our more specific pre-registered hypothesis (aim 2) that compared to the CONTROL intervention, the ACTIVE neurofeedback intervention would lead to an increase in ATL-SCC connectivity for guilt relative to indignation, whilst we were unable to demonstrate that the intervention increases connectivity for guilt on its own (aim 1). We also confirmed our prediction that there would be no safety concerns by showing stable Beck Depression Inventory scores (aim 3). Intriguingly, we were able to demonstrate an effect of the intervention in increasing global self-esteem (aim 4) despite this measure's focus on general feelings about oneself rather than a specific focus on the current state. Further strengthening the assumption that this training-induced increase in self-esteem was a result of the ATL-SCC connectivity increase for guilt vs. indignation, we found a positive correlation between self-esteem and connectivity changes.</p>
              <p id="p0235">Two additional findings render a non-specific boost in positive emotions or perceived success as explanations for this effect unlikely. Firstly, the ACTIVE intervention appears to have been more difficult and thus patients had a much lower thermometer level display on average, thus getting much less positive feedback on their performance than the CONTROL intervention group. The high success rates of stabilisation neurofeedback show that this was an adequate control intervention which was unlikely to have interfered with self-efficacy perceptions shown to be important for neurofeedback outcomes (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Mehler et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, self-esteem in the ACTIVE group increased despite lower levels of positive feedback and this did not lead to a group difference on training-induced changes in positive emotions as measured on the PANAS scale which focused on how people felt at this moment. The second finding suggesting that non-specific placebo-like effects of undergoing neurofeedback were unlikely was that both intervention groups reported lower positive emotions after training on the PANAS scale than before training which reflects qualitative reports of participants that the neurofeedback training was quite exhausting. This also shows that although habituation and fatigue could have affected connectivity changes in both groups, they were unlikely contributors to group differences.</p>
              <p id="p0240">Our finding of a direct relationship between ATL-SCC connectivity and global self-esteem in MDD provides further evidence for the important role of this neural system for self-worth in MDD (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2012</xref>). This direct link between self-blaming biases and self-worth in MDD provides further evidence for the revised learned helplessness model of MDD vulnerability (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abramson et al., 1978</xref>). Our findings are also in keeping with the hypothesis that self-blame-selective functional disconnection of right superior ATL representations of differentiated conceptual meaning of social behaviour (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Pobric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Zahn et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>) makes individuals more vulnerable to attribute self-blame in an overgeneral way (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0245">A more recent study (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Lythe et al., 2015</xref>), whose results were not available when designing the current trial, however, complicates this ATL-SCC disconnection hypothesis. This is because unexpectedly, higher rather than lower ATL-subgenual connectivity for self- vs. other-blame predicted risk of subsequent recurrence in remitted MDD. An anatomically more precise examination of these findings (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Price and Drevets, 2010</xref>), however, may offer clues as to resolving these discrepancies. Self-blame-selective decreases in connectivity were found close to the corpus callosum (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2012</xref>) (MNI: x-6, y = 22,z = 0) in a region between the more anterior BA24 which is close to the corpus callosum and the more posterior inferior subgenual cortex, BA25, which is not adjacent to the corpus callosum. In contrast, self-blame-selective increases in connectivity were found very clearly in the posterior inferior subgenual region ((<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Lythe et al., 2015</xref>), MNI x = 2,y = 14,z = −6), which corresponds to the core of BA25 (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Price and Drevets, 2010</xref>) and were not adjacent to the corpus callosum. Our more detailed anatomical characterisation of individualized SCC ROIs for the current study showed that it was indeed more frequently the more anterior subgenual cingulate area (BA24) which was used for training, whereas there were only 4 participants with ROI voxels falling into the more posterior inferior area (BA25 (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Price and Drevets, 2010</xref>), <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>f). This is in keeping with the hypothesis that the anterior SCC (BA24) and the posterior inferior subgenual cortex (BA25) play distinct roles in self-blaming biases and MDD (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2013</xref>) which will need to be investigated in future studies.</p>
              <p id="p0250">Our finding that patients with lower baseline levels of ATL-SCC connectivity for guilt relative to indignation had stronger training effects in the ACTIVE group should be used to design future trials by stratifying patients on the basis of their functional connectivity patterns when assigning them to a blame rebalance neurofeedback intervention. This is likely to increase the treatment effects and thus the statistical power of the trial. It remains unclear why the ACTIVE group had lower baseline connectivity for guilt vs. indignation compared with the CONTROL group, but one clue is offered by one participant in the control group with the highest baseline connectivity levels in the study, who showed potential bipolar features. Future trials should employ DSM5 criteria with its improved sensitivity for bipolar spectrum conditions which we may have under-detected in the current DSM-IV-based study, leading to potentially uncontrolled group differences in the frequency of patients whose condition would have been better captured by a bipolar spectrum diagnosis.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="p0260">Patients with MDD were shown to be able to modulate guilt-selective ATL-SCC functional connectivity after a single neurofeedback session and this improved their self-esteem. Furthermore, increases in self-esteem correlated with connectivity increases. Non-specific effects such as perceived success cannot explain these findings. Whilst preliminary, this is in keeping with the hypothesis of a relevant direct or indirect relationship between ATL-SCC connectivity and self-esteem, although confounding differences between the groups other than the received ATL-SCC connectivity feedback cannot be ruled out (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Mehler and Kording, 2018</xref>), and provides the clinical proof-of-concept for a novel functional MRI treatment target in MDD. Further studies are needed to investigate the differential roles of more posterior inferior and more anterior superior sectors of the subgenual region in the pathophysiology of MDD. This will be important in order to optimise future neurofeedback treatment protocols and for understanding the pathophysiology of self-blaming biases in MDD. Our study contributes to the emerging evidence on novel neurofeedback treatment targets for psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
