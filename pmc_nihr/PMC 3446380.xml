                  <p>Estrogen receptor-α (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positivity are inversely correlated by standard criteria.

                  <p>ER and HER2 levels were assessed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and (for HER2) fluorescent <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (FISH) and by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR) in formalin-fixed primary breast cancers from 448 patients in the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trial (ABC) tamoxifen-only arm.

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>ER and HER2 RNA levels were negatively correlated as expected in HER2+ve (IHC 3+ and/or FISH-amplified) tumors (<italic>r </italic>= -0.45; <italic>P </italic>= 0.0028). However, in HER2-ve tumors (ER+ve and ER-ve combined), a significant positive correlation was found (<italic>r </italic>= 0.43; <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.0001), HER2 RNA levels being 1.74-fold higher in ER+ve versus ER-ve tumors. This correlation was maintained in the ER+veHER2-ve subgroup (<italic>r </italic>= 0.24; <italic>P </italic>= 0.0023) and confirmed in this subgroup in 1,139 TransATAC tumours (<italic>r </italic>= 0.25; <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.0001). The positive relation extended to IHC-detected ER in ABC: mean ± 95% confidence interval (CI) H-scores were 90 ± 19 and 134 ± 19 for 0 and 1+ HER2 IHC categories, respectively (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0013). A trend toward lower relapse-free survival (RFS) was observed in patients with the lowest levels of ER and HER2 RNA levels within the ER+veHER2-ve subgroup both for ABC and TransATAC cohorts.</p>

                  <p>ER and HER2 expression is positively correlated in HER2-ve tumors. The distinction between HER2+ve and HER2-ve is greater in ER-ve than in ER+ve tumors. These findings are important to consider in clinical trials of anti-HER2 and anti-endocrine therapy in HER2-ve disease.</p>

              <p>Estrogen receptor-α (ER) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are the two key biomarkers that segregate the most distinct biologic subgroups of breast cancer and presently direct adjuvant treatment of primary disease. ER is expressed in approximately 80% of all breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Amplification or overexpression of <italic>HER2 </italic>or both are present in about 15% of breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The importance of these receptors as predictive biomarkers has been underpinned by the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP), who have issued guidelines for their accurate testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>In HER2-overexpressing (HER2+ve) metastatic cancer, treatment with trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy improves time to progression and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the adjuvant setting, sequential or concurrent trastuzumab improves disease-free survival and, in some trials, overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Despite its recognized benefit in HER2+ve disease, some evidence suggests this benefit also extends to HER2-non-overexpressing/normal (HER2-ve) cancer. Paik and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] showed that patients with normal HER2 copy number and protein levels lower than 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) may also benefit from trastuzumab. The NSABP B-47 (NCT 01275677) trial is now recruiting women with node-positive or high-risk node-negative HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ FISH-ve) invasive breast cancer to address these observations prospectively.</p>
              <p>HER2 overexpression is associated with partial resistance to endocrine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The complex cross-talk between ER and HER2 pathways might be an underlying cause of resistance, although the intrinsic biologic mechanism is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Some aspects of the relation between ER and HER2 expression have been described previously. ER and HER2 positivity are inversely correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], leading to approximately 10% of ER+ve tumors being HER2+ve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and about 50% of HER2+ve being ER+ve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. ER expression has also been shown to be quantitatively higher in HER2-ve than in HER2+ve tumors among ER+ve tumors; however, few analyses have been conducted on the quantitative relation within the HER2-ve subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, little evidence exists for the biologic importance of IHC 1+ versus 0 levels of HER2 expression, with both categories currently classified as HER2-ve. It is unclear whether IHC 1+ cases arise as an artifact of staining or reflect a true difference in expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, few data examine the relation between transcript levels and protein expression by IHC for HER2, even though this relation is well documented for ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>We have therefore (a) characterized gene expression, protein, and/or amplification levels for ER and HER2 individually; (b) explored the relation between ER and HER2 at both the protein and RNA levels, irrespective of the samples ER and HER2 status; and (c) evaluated the significance of transcript levels within the HER2-ve population and, in particular, the ER+veHER2-ve/subgroup in terms of relapse-free survival in a set of 448 early breast cancers from the NCRI Adjuvant Breast Cancer (ABC) Trial-Tamoxifen Late Relapse Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p>

                <p>The ABC Trial was a randomized, controlled phase III clinical trial comparing the addition of (a) chemotherapy (with or without elective ovarian ablation or suppression), and (b) ovarian ablation or suppression (with or without elective chemotherapy) to prolonged treatment with tamoxifen in women with early-stage breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. All patients were accrued between 1992 and 2000 and received at least 5 years of tamoxifen (20 mg/day), irrespective of ER status. The ABC Tamoxifen Late Relapse (TLR) study was designed as a retrospective translational research study within the main ABC trial to identify predictive biomarkers of late relapse. Four hundred and forty-eight archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks were obtained from participating centers for patients from the tamoxifen-alone arm. This study was approved by the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, and all patients included gave informed consent. Results on the primary aims of the ABC TLR study will be published separately.</p>

                <title>Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization</title>
                <p>Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed by using single cores (1-mm diameter) taken from donor blocks containing sufficient invasive tumor. Serial 4-μm sections from the TMAs were used for immunohistochemical and fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (FISH) analyses.</p>
                <p>ER was measured with immunohistochemistry (IHC) by using clone 6F11 (dilution 1/40; Leica Microsystems, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) and quantified with H-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. ER positivity was defined as H-score ≥ 1, which corresponds closely to an Allred score ≥ 3 and to the recently recommended IHC positivity cut-off, according to ASCO/CAP guidelines of &gt; 1% positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p>HER2 protein levels were assessed with the HercepTest (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and considered positive if IHC staining was 3+, equivocal for IHC 2+, and negative for IHC 0 and 1+, as per ASCO/CAP guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HER2 amplification was measured with FISH by using the Pathvysion HER-2 DNA Probe kit (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA) and considered positive, equivocal, or negative if FISH ratios (<italic>HER2</italic>/<italic>CEP17</italic>) were &gt; 2.2, 1.8 to 2.2, or &lt; 1.8, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

                <p>RNA extraction was performed on two 10-μm sections taken from each of the tumor blocks by using the RNeasy FFPE RNA Isolation kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK), according to the manufacturer's recommendations, except for an initial incubation in xylene (30 minutes, 37°C) for complete removal of paraffin. RNA was additionally treated to remove genomic DNA contamination (1 hour, 37°C) with 6 U of rDNase I (DNA-<italic>free </italic>Kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). RNA quality and quantity were evaluated by using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Expert Software version B.02.03; Agilent Technologies, Edinburgh, UK).</p>
                <p>Four hundred nanograms of RNA (in triplicate) was reverse transcribed with SuperScript III by using random primers (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Twenty nanograms of cDNA was analyzed with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) in triplicate by using the ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). Reference genes consisted of <italic>MRPL19</italic>, <italic>TFRC</italic>, and <italic>TBP</italic>, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The gene-expression assays and primers/probes used are detailed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Table S1.

                <p>ER and HER2 RNA data were log<sub>10 </sub>transformed. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the correlation between protein and RNA levels for both ER and HER2 and between FISH ratio and RNA levels for HER2 only. Differences between subpopulation means were assessed with the Mann-Whitney test, and analysis of variance for multigroup comparisons used the Kruskal-Wallis test with GraphPad Prism 5.0a software (La Jolla, CA, USA).</p>
                <p>Analysis of time-to-event data was undertaken by using Cox regression, multivariable fractional polynomials being used to investigate nonlinear relations and interactions between outcome and continuous parameters for ER and HER2 RNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and with STATA 10.1 software (College Station, TX, USA). Transcript levels for ER and HER2 by using the Oncotype DX test were available for 1,139 HER2-ve tumors from the TransATAC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] for validation of results presented here.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, the present study is the first to report a direct relation between ER and HER2 at the RNA level in HER2-ve tumors. The TransATAC set of material provided confirmation of this observation, and two other studies support this relation at the protein level but do not examine it in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p>ER and HER2 status is used to guide the decision-making process for patient treatment, but clinical trials have been conducted (for example, letrozole ± lapatinib, EGF30008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]) and are under way (chemotherapy ± trastuzumab, NSABP-B47) of HER2-targeted agents in HER2-ve disease in which the relations between (a) ER and HER2 and (b) HER2 IHC and mRNA expression are not well described. The present study revealed novel data that, as well as being of general biologic interest, may be important to the interpretation or conduct of these trials, respectively. In addition, the higher HER2 RNA expression in the ER+ve HER2-ve tumors might provide an escape route for such tumors during endocrine therapy.</p>
              <p>Here, ER and HER2 gene expression were measured on FFPE material with qRT-PCR. This technique allows a quantitative evaluation of biomarker expression and generation of data as a continuous variable, as opposed to IHC, which, other than by use of specialist techniques such as AQUA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], at most provides a semiquantitative reading, with categorization of data potentially leading to loss of information. Previous data from our laboratory had demonstrated an excellent correlation between fresh-frozen and FFPE materials for both ER and HER2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The reliability of gene expression measured with qRT-PCR in FFPE material, including ER and HER2 expression, has been extensively validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and is now included in commercial prognostic tools, such as Oncotype DX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>The well-described inverse relation between ER and HER2 based on status and the negative quantitative relation between ER and HER2 expression in HER2+ve tumors was confirmed in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Given this, the positive correlation between the RNA levels of ER and HER2 for HER2-ve patients was surprising but was confirmed as being present at a protein (IHC) level. The validity of the direct relation between ER and HER2 RNA levels was confirmed in the large TransATAC series of ER+veHER2-ve tumors. Data in the literature support this relation. Konecny <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] reported, but did not characterize further, a significant positive correlation between these markers at the protein level among HER2-ve tumors within their cohort A. Harigopal <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] also described a positive correlation between ER and HER2 detected with AQUA in tumors expressing ER and HER2 at the lowest quartiles of expression. In addition, the bottom (low) as well as the top (high) deciles of HER2 expression were significantly associated with worse disease-free survival. Our results also show worse relapse-free survival for the HER2-ve tumors expressing HER2 at the lowest levels. This relation with outcome was relatively modest but was consistent with the validation analyses undertaken with the TransATAC cohort. The significantly worse outcome shown for the lowest ER quartile probably reflects that this group is largely ER-ve; this effect was lost when the analysis was confined to ER+ve tumors.</p>
              <p>Currently, HER2 diagnostics for selecting patients for trastuzumab or other HER2-targeted treatments are based on a dichotomous categorization whereby patients with FISH+ve or IHC 3+/2+FISH+ve tumors are deemed positive. The data presented here reveal widely overlapping transcript levels between these conventionally HER2-positive and -negative categories, as well as between the "negative" IHC subcategories of 0, 1+, and 2+FISH-ve. Brase <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and Paik <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] also showed a continuous expression of HER2 RNA levels according to IHC/FISH categories. It is notable that although a major overlap exists between the groups, the HER2 IHC 1+ category shows significantly higher RNA levels than the IHC 0 category (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>), suggesting that some biologic meaning is associated with the separation of these IHC staining groups, rather than being merely a staining artefact. Although its importance is at present uncertain, Paik and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] found HER2-ve patients to benefit from trastuzumab to a similar extent as do HER2+ve patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This finding will be prospectively addressed in the recently initiated NSABP-B47 study of trastuzumab in HER2 IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ FISH-ve cases (NCT 01275677). Our results indicate that, at least at a transcript level, these groups are only modestly different from HER2 IHC 0 cases. An assessment of the quantitative level of HER2 at the transcript level is merited, in that and other studies of this population, as a possible predictor of benefit. This continuous expression of HER2 at a transcript level, as noted earlier, is also seen with techniques such as AQUA and may have implications for the targeting of agents such as the HER2-cytotoxic conjugate TDM-1, which may rely more on the level of binding to cells than an opposing underlying HER2-driven growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our data also have implications for the confidence in ascribing of HER2 positivity in diagnostics. The difference in HER2 RNA levels between HER2+ve and HER2-ve tumors was more evident in the ER-ve than in the ER+ve population (13.7-fold versus 6.1-fold difference, respectively). These data suggest that the distinction of HER2+ve from HER2-ve tumors in pathologic diagnosis may be subject to greater error in ER+ve than in ER-ve patients.</p>
              <p>Our study has some limitations. Single-core TMAs were used for ER and HER2 IHC assessment, and although the expression of these markers is not highly heterogeneous, some relations may be weakened. It is unlikely, though, that this might lead to false-positive relations. These IHC/FISH TMA results were compared with qRT-PCR results from whole sections, and this is also likely to add to the variability observed. However, given that a false-positive finding has been excluded by the TransATAC validation dataset, this variability is most likely to reduce the strength of the reported relations.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>ER and HER2 are positively correlated at both protein and RNA levels in HER2-ve tumors, contrary to their recognized negative relation in HER2+ve disease. The distinction between HER2+ve and HER2-ve is greater in ER-ve than in ER+ve tumors. These findings may lead to greater diagnostic uncertainties in ER+ve patients and are important to consider in clinical trials of anti-HER2 and anti-endocrine therapy in HER2-ve disease.</p>
