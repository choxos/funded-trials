                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The primary analysis of the INBUILD trial showed that in subjects with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), nintedanib slowed the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 52‚ÄÖweeks. We report the effects of nintedanib on ILD progression over the whole trial.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Subjects with fibrosing ILDs other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, who had ILD progression within the 24‚ÄÖmonths before screening despite management deemed appropriate in clinical practice, were randomised to receive nintedanib or placebo. Subjects continued on blinded randomised treatment until all subjects had completed the trial. Over the whole trial, mean¬±<sc>sd</sc> exposure to trial medication was 15.6¬±7.2 and 16.8¬±5.8‚ÄÖmonths in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In the nintedanib (n=332) and placebo (n=331) groups, respectively, the proportions of subjects who had ILD progression (absolute decline in FVC ‚â•10% predicted) or died were 40.4% and 54.7% in the overall population (hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.53‚Äì0.83; p=0.0003) and 43.7% and 55.8% among subjects with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like fibrotic pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53‚Äì0.91; p=0.009). In the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively, the proportions who had an acute exacerbation of ILD or died were 13.9% and 19.6% in the overall population (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46‚Äì0.98; p=0.04) and 15.0% and 22.8% among subjects with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39‚Äì0.97; p=0.03).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Based on data from the whole INBUILD trial, nintedanib reduced the risk of events indicating ILD progression.</p>

Randomised placebo-controlled trials demonstrated that nintedanib reduces the rate of progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) over 52‚ÄÖweeks in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD) [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], resulting in the regulatory approval of nintedanib for the treatment of these conditions.</p>
              <p>The INBUILD trial enrolled subjects with chronic fibrosing ILDs other than IPF who met criteria for progression of ILD within the previous 2‚ÄÖyears despite management deemed appropriate in clinical practice [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Over 52‚ÄÖweeks, nintedanib reduced the rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) (mL per year) <italic toggle="yes">versus</italic> placebo by 57% in the overall population and by 61% in subjects with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like fibrotic pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) (the co-primary analysis populations) [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In subgroup analyses, no heterogeneity was detected in the effect of nintedanib <italic toggle="yes">versus</italic> placebo on the rate of FVC decline across diagnostic subgroups [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As subjects continued to receive blinded randomised treatment until the last subject had completed the trial, most subjects received trial medication for &gt;52‚ÄÖweeks. Here, we report the effects of nintedanib <italic toggle="yes">versus</italic> placebo on time-to-event end-points assessing progression of ILD over the whole INBUILD trial.</p>

                <p>The design of the INBUILD trial (<ext-link xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT02999178) has been described and the protocol is publicly available [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Briefly, eligible subjects had a fibrosing ILD other than IPF, diagnosed by the investigator according to their usual practice, reticular abnormality with traction bronchiectasis (with or without honeycombing) of &gt;10% extent on HRCT, FVC ‚â•45% predicted and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic><sub>LCO</sub>) 30‚Äì‚Ää&lt;80% predicted. Subjects met at least one of the following criteria for ILD progression within the 24‚ÄÖmonths before screening, despite management deemed appropriate in clinical practice: relative decline in FVC ‚â•10% predicted; relative decline in FVC 5‚Äì‚Ää&lt;10% predicted and worsened respiratory symptoms; relative decline in FVC 5‚Äì‚Ää&lt;10% predicted and increased extent of fibrosis on HRCT; or worsened respiratory symptoms and increased extent of fibrosis on HRCT. These criteria were determined by the investigator with no central adjudication. Subjects taking azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, rituximab, cyclophosphamide or oral glucocorticoids &gt;20‚ÄÖmg¬∑day<sup>‚àí1</sup> were not enrolled. Initiation of these medications was allowed after 6‚ÄÖmonths of the trial in cases of deterioration of ILD or autoimmune disease.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>Subjects were randomised to receive nintedanib 150‚ÄÖmg twice daily or placebo, stratified by fibrotic pattern on HRCT (UIP-like fibrotic pattern or other fibrotic patterns) based on central review [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For each subject, the trial consisted of two parts: Part A, which comprised 52‚ÄÖweeks of treatment, and Part B, a variable treatment period beyond week 52 during which subjects continued to receive blinded randomised treatment until all the subjects had completed the trial. Subjects who discontinued treatment were asked to attend all visits as planned, including an end-of-treatment visit and a follow-up visit 4‚ÄÖweeks later. Subjects who were still on treatment at the end of Part B were eligible to enter an open-label extension study (INBUILD-ON; <ext-link xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT03820726). The final database lock took place after all subjects had completed the follow-up visit or had entered INBUILD-ON (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Analyses</title>
                <p>In the overall population and in subjects with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT, we assessed the effects of nintedanib on time to the following: absolute and relative declines in FVC ‚â•5% predicted, absolute and relative declines in FVC ‚â•10% predicted, death, ILD progression (absolute decline in FVC ‚â•10% predicted) or death, and acute exacerbation of ILD (defined in [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) or death, and acute exacerbations of ILD were not adjudicated. Analyses were based on time to first event. Analyses were based on a log-rank test (stratified by UIP-like fibrotic pattern or other fibrotic patterns on HRCT in analyses in the overall population), and a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by the same factor, was used to derive the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval. Adverse events, reported irrespective of causality, in the overall population were coded using preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and are presented descriptively. Analyses were based on subjects who received at least one dose of trial medication. Analyses were pre-specified except for the analyses of time to absolute and relative declines in FVC % predicted.</p>

                <p>Adverse events of increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were more common in subjects treated with nintedanib than placebo (<xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Based on laboratory tests, elevations in ALT and/or AST to ‚â•3 times the upper limit of the normal range were observed in 47 subjects (14.2%) in the nintedanib group and six subjects (1.8%) in the placebo group. For most of these cases (43 out of 47 subjects in the nintedanib group and six out of six subjects in the placebo group), these elevations returned to within the normal range spontaneously with continued treatment or after dose reduction or treatment interruption. One subject in each treatment group had concurrent elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin that met criteria for Hy's law.</p>

              <p>These analyses, based on the longest duration of follow-up in the INBUILD trial (median ‚àº19‚ÄÖmonths), show that in patients with fibrosing ILDs that have progressed within the 2‚ÄÖyears prior to enrolment, events indicating further progression of ILD occurred frequently. In the placebo group, 55% of subjects in the overall population and 56% of subjects with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT had progression of ILD (absolute decline in FVC ‚â•10% predicted) or died. These findings support previous analyses showing that over 52‚ÄÖweeks, subjects who received placebo in the INBUILD trial had a clinical course similar to patients with untreated IPF, irrespective of the underlying ILD diagnosis or the fibrotic pattern on HRCT [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our observations lend further support to the concept that there are patients with progressive fibrosing ILDs who can be managed based on their similarity in longitudinal clinical behaviour despite treatment considered appropriate in clinical practice [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>While there is no established definition for progressive fibrosing ILD, a number of sets of criteria have been proposed based on a multifaceted approach including measurement of decline in FVC [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our observations demonstrate that the inclusion criteria used in the INBUILD trial identified patients with progressive ILD who were at high risk of further progression and mortality. This does not mean that patients do not need to receive an accurate diagnosis of ILD (this remains essential to ensure that systemic and environmental causes of ILD can be addressed), but highlights the importance of prompt identification of patients whose ILD is progressing so that they can be managed appropriately.</p>
              <p>A decline in FVC of &gt;10% predicted has consistently been associated with mortality in studies across fibrosing ILDs [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous analyses of data from the INBUILD trial have shown that over 52‚ÄÖweeks, a relative decline in FVC of &gt;10% predicted was associated with a more than three-fold increase in the risk of death, both in the overall population and in subjects with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Over the whole trial, nintedanib reduced the risk of a relative decline in FVC of ‚â•10% predicted by 37% compared with placebo in the overall population and by 39% in subjects with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT.</p>
              <p>Acute exacerbations are a recognised feature of the natural history of IPF [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While there is no established definition for an acute exacerbation of ILDs other than IPF, there is increasing evidence that acute exacerbations of ILD occur in a proportion of patients with such ILDs and are associated with high mortality [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Over the whole INBUILD trial, 20% of subjects in the placebo group had an acute exacerbation of ILD or died. Nintedanib reduced the risk of an acute exacerbation or death by 33% <italic toggle="yes">versus</italic> placebo in the overall population and by 38% in those with a UIP-like fibrotic pattern on HRCT, similar to the reduction in the risk of acute exacerbations observed with nintedanib in patients with IPF [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>The adverse event profile of nintedanib over the whole INBUILD trial was consistent with that observed over the first 52‚ÄÖweeks [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with no new safety signals observed. The adverse event profile of nintedanib in the INBUILD trial was consistent with that observed in subjects with IPF [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and SSc-ILD [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly diarrhoea, were the most common adverse events. Elevations in liver enzymes were more common in subjects treated with nintedanib than placebo, but most normalised spontaneously or after dose reduction or treatment interruption.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, analyses based on the data from the whole INBUILD trial show that in patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs that had shown progression within the 2‚ÄÖyears prior to enrolment, events indicating further progression of ILD occurred frequently. Nintedanib slowed the progression of ILD, with an adverse event profile that was consistent with that observed over 52‚ÄÖweeks.</p>
