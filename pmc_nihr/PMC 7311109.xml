                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Patients infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are being treated empirically with oseltamivir, but there is little evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the treatment of coronavirus infections with oseltamivir.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Aim</title>
                  <p>To determine whether adding oseltamivir to usual care reduces time to recovery in symptomatic patients who have tested positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2).</p>
                </sec>

                  <p>Exploratory analysis of data from an open-label, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial during three influenza seasons, from 2016 to 2018, in primary care research networks, in 15 European countries.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>Patients aged ≥1 year presenting to primary care with influenza-like illness (ILI), and who tested positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2), were randomised to usual care or usual care plus oseltamivir. The primary outcome was time to recovery defined as a return to usual activities, with minor or absent fever, headache, and muscle ache.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Coronaviruses (CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-KU1 and CoV-NL63) were identified in 308 (9%) out of 3266 randomised participants in the trial; 153 of these were allocated to usual care and 155 to usual care plus oseltamivir; the primary outcome was ascertained in 136 and 147 participants, respectively. The median time to recovery was shorter in patients randomised to oseltamivir: 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3–6) versus 5 days (IQR 3–8; hazard ratio 1.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.03 to 1.66; <italic>P</italic> = 0.026).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Primary care patients with ILI testing positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2) recovered sooner when oseltamivir was added to usual care compared with usual care alone. This may be of relevance to the primary care management of COVID-19.</p>

              <p>Patients infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and suffering from COVID-19 are currently being treated with drug combinations that include oseltamivir.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The authors had previously found that adding oseltamivir to usual primary care for influenza-like illness (ILI) accelerates recovery by about 1 day in those with ILI, and longer in those with key risk factors in the ALIC<sup>4</sup>E study (a randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness in primary care).<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This effect did not appear to be mediated by influenza virus status as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from nasopharyngeal swabs. Outcomes for patients found positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2) had not been analysed separately. Given the evolving pandemic, this study set out to conduct a post-hoc exploratory analysis of the open-label, pragmatic, ALIC<sup>4</sup>E trial data to explore whether adding oseltamivir to usual primary care for patients with ILI who have tested positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2) is effective in reducing time to recovery.</p>

                <p>Patients aged ≥1 year presenting to primary care with ILI during three seasonal influenza seasons (15 January 2016 to 12 April 2018) in 15 European countries, randomised in the ALIC<sup>4</sup>E trial and infected with coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2) were eligible for this study. ILI was defined as a sudden onset of self-reported fever, with ≥1 respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, running or congested nose) and one systemic symptom (headache, muscle ache, sweats or chills, or tiredness), with symptom duration of ≤72 hours during a seasonal influenza epidemic.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Coronavirus infection was confirmed using the Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 plus real-time PCR assay on baseline swabs.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> An oropharyngeal and nasal swab (COPAN) were taken from those aged &lt;16 years and a nasopharyngeal swab (COPAN) from those aged ≥16 years. PCR results were not available for clinicians to inform management.</p>

This study, from 2016 to 2018, found that primary care patients with symptomatic coronavirus infection (not including SARS-CoV-2) recovered sooner when oseltamivir was added to usual care. Therefore, oseltamivir might be considered for the primary care management of (suspected) COVID-19.</td>

                <p>Patients were asked to complete a symptom diary for 14 days in order to indicate when they had returned to their usual daily activities and to evaluate fever, running/congested nose, sore throat, headache, cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, sweats/chills, diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, low energy/tiredness, sleeplessness, dizziness, and feeling generally unwell as ‘no’, ‘minor’, ‘moderate’, or ‘major’ problem. These were supplemented with child-specific questions so that the Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness Flu Scale was completed for children aged &lt;13 years.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Patients were contacted via telephone after 2–4 days, 14–28 days, and 28 days to support study participation, diary completion, monitor intervention adherence, and to ascertain a minimal outcome data set.</p>

                <p>Characteristics of the participants with coronavirus infection in the two study arms are presented. For this exploratory data analysis, the authors produced the Kaplan– Meier survival curves for each treatment group and estimated the hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and associated <italic>P</italic>-value, comparing treatment groups with a Cox proportional hazard regression model. The analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomised patients in the arm they were assigned regardless of treatment received.

              <p>Coronaviruses (CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-KU1 and CoV-NL63, which are known pathogens in humans) were identified in 308 (9%) of 3266 randomised participants from 21 networks covering 209 primary care practices in 15 European countries over three consecutive influenza seasons. Of these identified cases, 130 were male (42%) and 17 were aged &gt;65 years (6%); 153 were randomised to usual care and 155 were randomised to usual care plus oseltamivir. The primary outcome was ascertained in 136 (89%) and 147 (95%) participants, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the randomisation groups (<xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The 25 patients who did not provide primary outcome data were more often male, aged &lt;12 years, 20 (80%) more often included in the final season, and more often had a chronic respiratory condition (see Supplementary Table S1).</p>

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>This exploratory analysis of the ALIC<sup>4</sup>E trial data from 2016 to 2018 suggests that primary care patients with ILI, who tested positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2) and received usual care, returned to their usual activities with relevant residual symptoms, minor or absent, in a median of 5 days (mean 6.35 days). Patients also receiving oseltamivir returned about 1 day sooner.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The present pragmatic, open trial design did not allow identification of mechanisms of action, or a measure of how much of the observed effect can be attributed specifically to oseltamivir or other possible effects, but allows the observed results to likely reflect real world effects in primary care.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It should be noted that this was a primary care study and that the findings cannot be extrapolated to more severely ill and/or hospitalised patients. In addition, though unlikely, SARS-CoV-2 may respond differently to oseltamivir.</p>

                <title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
                <p>This study’s findings are consistent with other studies showing benefit of oseltamivir in all patients with ILI,<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and with previous placebo-controlled evidence for adults and children with ILI, irrespective of infection by influenza or another virus.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Previously published possible explanations include that oseltamivir’s mode of action may include generalised non-specific mechanisms, and/or an action on a wider range of viruses,<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> or, that a placebo effect was found in the present study. However, in the ALIC<sup>4</sup>E trial there was no evidence of a differential relative benefit in subgroups, such as those with lower illness severity where systematic reviews suggest a more marked placebo response.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In addition, the ALIC<sup>4</sup>E trial’s overall estimate of benefit is similar to effects found in placebo-controlled trials.</p>

                <title>Implications for research and practice</title>
                <p>Secondary analysis of data from the placebo-controlled trials of oseltamivir in patients with ILI not caused by influenza viruses, for example by coronaviruses, and new placebo-controlled trials in patients with COVID-19 could help elucidate a causal effect for its benefit in those patients. Meanwhile, adding oseltamivir to usual primary care appears to accelerate recovery by about 1 day in patients with ILI who test positive for coronavirus (not including SARS-CoV-2), and, though the present study has not proven that SARS-CoV-2 responds to oseltamivir, this drug could be considered for the management of primary care patients with (suspected) COVID-19.</p>
