                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker more specific for bacterial infection and responds quicker than other commonly used biomarkers such as C reactive protein, but is not routinely used in the National Health Service (NHS). Studies mainly in adults show that using PCT to guide clinicians may reduce antibiotic use, reduce hospital stay, with no associated adverse effects such as increased rates of hospital re-admission, incomplete treatment of infections, relapse or death. A review conducted for National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends further research on PCT testing to guide antibiotic use in children.</p>

                  <p>Biomarker-guided duration of Antibiotic Treatment in Children Hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection is a multi-centre, prospective, two-arm, individually Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) with a 28-day follow-up and internal pilot. The intervention is a PCT-guided algorithm used in conjunction with best practice. The control arm is best practice alone. We plan to recruit 1942 children, aged between 72 hours and up to 18 years old, who are admitted to the hospital and being treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. Coprimary outcomes are duration of antibiotic use and a composite safety measure. Secondary outcomes include time to switch from broad to narrow spectrum antibiotics, time to discharge, adverse drug reactions, health utility and cost-effectiveness. We will also perform a qualitative process evaluation. Recruitment commenced in June 2018 and paused briefly between March and May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Sepsis causes many non-specific symptoms and signs that can also be caused by a large number of conditions that may or may not be due to infection, and that may or may not require immediate or urgent treatment. Sepsis is usually caused by bacteria, although viral and fungal causes do occur. The problem for clinicians is the difficulty in distinguishing bacterial sepsis from other conditions presenting with similar non-specific signs and symptoms. Prompt administration of antibiotics reduces mortality by half,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> but indiscriminate antibiotic use unnecessarily increases antimicrobial resistance (AMR), resulting in increased costs in hospitalised patients,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> which represents a significant resource burden in the National Health Service (NHS). Not all children admitted with bacterial infection will meet the criteria for sepsis, but they could still have serious infection, requiring intravenous antibiotics for several days.</p>
              <p>Biomarker blood tests currently used in the NHS, such as C reactive protein (CRP) do not reliably differentiate beween severe bacterial infection (SBI) (defined previously<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and inflammation, and show a delayed response to bacterial infection. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker released in response to inflammatory stimuli including bacterial infections, with very high levels produced in SBI.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In contrast to CRP, PCT rises early and peaks early, and falls rapidly in response to effective antimicrobial therapy. This makes blood PCT potentially a better biomarker for monitoring progression of SBI and response to antimicrobial therapy, and for facilitating clinical decision making by informing initiation, change or discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. It supports the aims of the Department of Health Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2019–2024 of conserving and stewarding the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials by ensuring that antibiotics are used responsibly and less often (ie, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS)).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>There is strong evidence for introducing paediatric AMS programmes in hospital settings, in terms of reduced antibiotic use, improved quality of prescribing and cost-savings. Long-term and sustainable reductions in antimicrobial prescribing and a reduction of resistance rates at a population level have been achieved by the implementation of nationally coordinated, whole-system approaches, with no evidence of an increase in the rate of serious infection or bacterial complications.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We recently published a large study prospectively assessing the performance of multiple biomarkers of SBI in a heterogeneous cohort of critically ill children and uniquely profiled longitudinal biomarker changes. Longitudinal profiles for PCT showed the greatest percentage drop in values over the first 7 days of therapy in children with SBI, suggesting that PCT might be useful in guiding duration of antimicrobial therapy in children.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on AMS (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng15" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng15</ext-link>) recommends decision support systems as an AMS intervention. The use of a PCT-based algorithm to guide antibiotic stopping or escalation is one such decision support system which can be used. The AMS guidelines made research recommendations including RCTs to determine whether short or long courses of antibiotics reduce AMR and whether using point-of-care tests is clinically and cost-effective when prescribing antimicrobials in children with respiratory tract infections. The Biomarker-guided duration of Antibiotic Treatment in Children Hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection (BATCH) trial described in this paper is aligned with these recommendations in seeking to evaluate if PCT-guided management can result in shorter courses of antibiotics while not increasing the risk of adverse outcomes to paediatric patients.</p>
              <p>A systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis conducted on behalf of NICE (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg18" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg18</ext-link>) evaluated PCT testing to guide antibiotic therapy for the treatment of sepsis in intensive care settings and for suspected bacterial infection in emergency department (ED) settings in adults and children.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It concluded that addition of a PCT algorithm to the information used to guide antibiotic treatment may reduce antibiotic exposure in adults in intensive care unit (ICU) settings and in the ED without any adverse consequences and may also be associated with reductions in the length of hospital and ICU stay in adults. Evidence was not found on the effectiveness using a PCT algorithm to guide antibiotic treatment for children with suspected or confirmed SBI admitted from emergency care. None of the identified studies were conducted in the UK, and it was not clear whether the control arms of these studies were representative of standard practice in the UK. Therefore, the report recommended further studies to adequately assess the effectiveness of adding PCT algorithms to the information used to guide antibiotic treatment in adults and children with suspected or confirmed SBI in ICU settings and in adults and children with suspected bacterial infection in ED settings. It states that further studies are needed particularly for children, where data are currently lacking, and research examining (short-term) health-state utility values in the UK for adults and children with confirmed or suspected SBI in the ICU and ED.</p>
              <p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of antibiotic duration for bacterial infections in children demonstrated that intravenous to oral switch can occur earlier than previously recommended.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The authors produced recommendations for antibiotic duration and intravenous to oral switch to support clinical decision making, and recommend prospective research on optimal antibiotic durations. The lack of good evidence on recommended duration of antibiotic therapy leads to an overuse of antibiotics, contributing to the development of AMR. Combating AMR has been identified as a national and global priority. Shorter courses of antibiotic therapy would be associated with reductions in adverse effects for patients, and reductions in healthcare resource utilisation. Results from this research will inform recommendations relating to the duration of antibiotic use in future guideline updates including NICE sepsis guidelines.</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>In children randomised to the intervention arm, a blood sample will be sent to the hospital laboratory for a PCT test at baseline/randomisation and every 1–3 days while still on intravenous antibiotics to align with clinical workflow and routine laboratory testing where possible. This includes instances where intravenous antibiotics are restarted for the same infection (up to day 28 postrandomisation). An additional 1 mL (minimum 0.5 mL) lithium heparin samples will be collected for PCT analysis.</p>
                <p>PCT tests will be performed on a bioMérieux VIDAS platform. It is a prerequisite that participating sites have access this platform to take part in the trial. This is a semiautomated immunoassay system based on Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay principles. Calibration is performed in line with manufacturer’s guidelines. It is simple and flexible to use and gives results in 20 min. It requires 200 µL of plasma or serum and can be run on a sample sent for routine biochemistry after the routine tests have been performed.</p>
                <p>PCT results feed into an algorithm where thresholds have been defined by previous data (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The algorithm provides both definitive guidelines, for example, stop antibiotics if PCT&lt;0.25 ng/mL, and advisory guidelines, for example, consider oral switch if PCT decreased by <underline>&gt;</underline>80%. Clinicians can overrule the algorithm if they feel it is appropriate to do so. The algorithm values are based on our now published work which is the largest study to prospectively assess the performance of multiple biomarkers of SBI in a heterogeneous cohort of critically ill children and uniquely profiles longitudinal biomarker changes within the cohort.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>

                <p>Patient and public involvement (PPI) will be sought throughout the research process, from conceptualisation to dissemination. An example of this is the active involvement of the Liverpool GenerationR Young People’s Advisory Group (YPAG) in contributing to the design of this research.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The group consists of 24 young people aged between 8 and 21 years old who have worked with several researchers exploring the topic of developing tests to rapidly detect or diagnose SBI in children. YPAG members are well aware of the problems associated with diagnosing and treating sepsis and have discussed at length the issues associated with AMR and the need to educate young people and families about the misuse of antibiotics.</p>
                <p>We will involve the Liverpool GenerationR YPAG, throughout the duration of the trial. The group will advise on children’s information sheets and the production of educational materials for young people and families on the most appropriate use of antibiotics. We will invite parents and young people to contribute actively to dissemination events, including presenting parents’ and young peoples’ views and stories. Parent representatives will also be invited to attend Trial Management and Steering Group Meetings. Members of the YPAG and parents will be trained by our PPI lead.</p>

An assessment of causality between the event and the trial intervention will be carried out by the principal investigator or delegated clinician, and then independently by a clinical reviewer who will also assess expectedness. If the clinical reviewer classifies the event as probably or definitely caused by the intervention, it will be classified as a serious adverse reaction.</p>

                <p>Two coprimary outcomes (intravenous antibiotics duration and a composite safety outcome) are defined in this trial<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the overall sample size is determined by both.</p>
                <p>The focus for the intervention is on moving the step down from intravenous to oral therapy earlier, and therefore the time until this step down is the primary outcome on antibiotic usage, and the trial is powered to detect if PCT-directed care is <italic toggle="yes">superior</italic> to standard care on time until switch from intravenous antibiotics. The size of potential shortening of time to detect an effect has been taken from a systematic review.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The safety coprimary (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>) is a composite measure reflecting various outcomes which represent deterioration or lack of clinical response in the child, and would be expected to increase if intravenous antibiotics were being withdrawn inappropriately early.</p>
                <p>In terms of intravenous antibiotic duration, a 1 day reduction<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> in antibiotics from an estimated median of 5 days in the control arm (from our observation data<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) demonstrates an HR of 1.25. At a 5% significance level with 90% power, 844 participants with observed intravenous antibiotics duration are needed. In terms of the event rates of safety elements, an observational study showed a readmission rate of 15% at day 28.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In critically ill patients, up to 3% reinstating intravenous antibiotic therapy rate, and 3% mortality were reported.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 18 20</xref> With some overlaps considered, we estimate around 15% overall rate of our composite safety outcome. The SAPS trial in adults used a non-inferiority margin of 8% for mortality.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Given the lower expected rate of safety outcomes in this population we have chosen a similar relative non-inferiority bound of 5%. This means increases in the composite safety measure of less than 5% (from 15% to 20%) using PCT guided therapy would be considered as not inferior. With a one-sided significance level of 0.05% and 90% power we would need 1748 participants to test non-inferiority. Overall, with 1748 effectively recruited participants, we would have 99% power to detect antibiotic duration decrease and 90% power to test non-inferiority in safety separately. Assuming that these two coprimary outcomes are independent, this would give us at least 89% power for the combined analysis.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> By considering 10% loss to follow-up for the primary outcomes, our final targeted sample size is inflated to 1942 as achievable.</p>

This analysis will control for balancing factors in the randomisation. A positive conclusion will only be made if both a decrease in intravenous antibiotic duration AND non-inferiority in safety can be demonstrated (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). We will assess if heterogeneity among centres exists and fit a two-level model with random centre effects if confirmed. Adherence to the PCT algorithm will be recorded, and per-protocol and complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis will be undertaken to test the treatment effects to patients with fully used PCT algorithm (<xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>).

                <p>Health economic analysis will include direct and indirect costs associated with unscheduled admissions (to ward or PICU), re-admissions, re-starting intravenous antibiotics and hospital-acquired infections. Descriptive and regression analysis will be used to identify key elements of service use and cost and to explore the potential impact of baseline participant characteristics on the costs and outcomes measures. Average cost per participant will be estimated at the end of the treatment and the follow-up periods, respectively, and average cost per subgroup of patients may be explored for the same time points. Bootstrapping and missing data imputation will be done if justified. Differences in each arm will be assessed and used for the computation of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We will calculate ICERs for a clinically effective outcome (fewer days on intravenous antibiotics with increased or equivalent safety) and the cost per intravenous antibiotic day avoided.</p>
                <p>A cost-effectiveness analysis will assess possible efficiency gains. An NHS perspective will be used and relevant direct medical costs will be collected. Information on resource use will include data on inpatient bed days, antibiotic consumption, nursing and medical resources, other medicines including over the counter medicines, diagnostic and monitoring laboratory tests, GP visits and emergency visits. Direct hospital costs will be calculated by multiplying resource use with the accompanying unit costs collected from patient level data in the participating hospitals, routine NHS sources (eg, NHS reference costs and <italic toggle="yes">British National Formulary</italic> and from the manufacturer of the PCT test, as appropriate. Time horizon will be 28 days, therefore there is no need to consider a discount rate. Patients’ health utility will be measured using CHU9D up to day 28.</p>

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be constructed. Information on direct non-medical costs, such as travelling to and from the hospitals, and indirect costs, such as parents’ productivity losses, will also be collected.</p>

Interviews will be conducted after the participant reaches their day 28 follow-up. A purposive sample strategy will be employed to include parents from both intervention and control arms and inclusion of different sites.</p>
                <p>It will also aim to explore the views and experiences of health professionals involved in the BATCH trial (n=10–20) about participating in an RCT with a focus on acceptability of the trial, clinical equipoise, taking informed consent and support needs of trial involvement. Interviews will be conducted at two time points (before or at the beginning and after the intervention) which will enable us to capture whether there are any changes in attitudes towards the PCT test. A purposive sample strategy will be developed to address representation from up to five different sites and variation in health professional role (eg, ward nurse, consultant, research nurse, etc).</p>
                <p>With regards to the sample size for both health professionals and parents, the qualitative researcher(s) will make pragmatic decisions along with the research team regarding when enough is known about certain themes (ie, data saturation has occurred.</p>
                <p>Semi-structured interviews will be undertaken face-to-face or via telephone. They will be recorded and transcribed. Data will be double coded and analysed using thematic analysis. Non-participant observation of episodes of patient care and trial delivery (of both arms) will also be carried out in some centres. Observations and field notes will enable an understanding of how the individual intervention components and delivery processes work in the real healthcare setting.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This trial has the potential to impact the clinical care of hospitalised children with confirmed or suspected SBI, which currently accounts for a large proportion of antibiotic use in hospitalised children. It will contribute to the development of PCT-guided antibiotic management guidelines of infections in hospitalised children, and will address the safety of shorter antibiotic courses. If shorter duration of PCT-guided antimicrobial therapy is shown to be safe and effective, this will have major implications for direct and indirect costs of childhood hospitalisations from infection. This will potentially lead to significant reductions in duration of hospitalisation and reduced antibiotic exposure, resulting in a positive impact on healthcare services and societal costs. Reduced exposure to antibiotics will, in turn, reduce AMR. This trial will demonstrate if introducing PCT-guided AMS management in the NHS is cost-effective. Reduced antibiotic use will lead to reduced hospital costs and reduced ADRs.</p>
              <p>This trial is timely as it aligns with the current Department of Health Five Year action plan for AMR 2019 to 2024 and is a response to research recommendations from two published NICE guidance documents (DG18 and NG15).</p>
