                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection continue to rise in the Arabian Peninsula 7 years after it was first described in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK) and included healthy people aged 18–50 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies (and a negative urinary pregnancy test for women). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 MERS at three different doses: the low-dose group received 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> viral particles, the intermediate-dose group received 2·5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles, and the high-dose group received 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by the occurrence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events after vaccination. The secondary objective was to assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immunospot, ELISA, and virus neutralising assays after vaccination. Participants were followed up for up to 12 months.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between March 14 and Aug 15, 2018, 24 participants were enrolled: six were assigned to the low-dose group, nine to the intermediate-dose group, and nine to the high-dose group. All participants were available for follow-up at 6 months, but five (one in the low-dose group, one in the intermediate-dose group, and three in the high-dose group) were lost to follow-up at 12 months. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS was safe at doses up to 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported by 12 months. One serious adverse event reported was deemed to be not related to ChAdOx1 MERS. 92 (74% [95% CI 66–81]) of 124 solicited adverse events were mild, 31 (25% [18–33]) were moderate, and all were self-limiting. Unsolicited adverse events in the 28 days following vaccination considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to ChAdOx1 MERS were predominantly mild in nature and resolved within the follow-up period of 12 months. The proportion of moderate and severe adverse events was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the intermediate-dose group (relative risk 5·83 [95% CI 2·11–17·42], p&lt;0·0001) Laboratory adverse events considered to be at least possibly related to the study intervention were self-limiting and predominantly mild in severity. A significant increase from baseline in T-cell (p&lt;0·003) and IgG (p&lt;0·0001) responses to the MERS-CoV spike antigen was observed at all doses. Neutralising antibodies against live MERS-CoV were observed in four (44% [95% CI 19–73]) of nine participants in the high-dose group 28 days after vaccination, and 19 (79% [58–93]) of 24 participants had antibodies capable of neutralisation in a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay.</p>

                  <p>ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV. The results of this first-in-human clinical trial support clinical development progression into field phase 1b and 2 trials.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para30">There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or specific therapeutics to treat it. ChAdOx1 MERS has been previously reported to be immunogenic and protective in mice in a challenge model, and immunogenic and partially protective in dromedary camels in a natural transmission model. We searched PubMed for research articles published between database inception and Nov 20, 2019, using various combinations of the terms “MERS”, MERS-CoV”, “Middle East respiratory syndrome”, “anti-Middle East respiratory syndrome”, “vaccine”, “phase” and “clinical trial”. No language restriction was applied. One clinical trial has been published, describing a phase 1 study done in the USA, of a DNA vaccine against MERS, using a three-dose vaccination regimen of intramuscular injection followed by colocalised intramuscular electroporation at weeks 0, 4, and 12. The vaccine was well tolerated. Seroconversion measured by S1 ELISA occurred in 59 (86%) of 69 participants after two vaccinations and in 61 (94%) of 65 participants after three vaccinations. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 34 (50%) of 68 participants.</p>
                <p id="para40">
                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para50">This study is the first clinical study of ChAdOx1 MERS. At all dose levels tested (5 × 10<sup>9</sup>, 2·5 × 10<sup>10</sup>, and 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) the vaccine was safe and well tolerated. In the majority of participants, humoral and cellular MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-specific immune responses were induced, and maintained at levels higher than the pre-vaccination response during the 1-year follow-up period. The study was done in the UK.</p>
                <p id="para60">
                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para70">A vaccine against MERS-CoV could be used to prevent zoonotic transmission, especially in people who are frequently exposed to camels in the Middle East, to immunise health-care workers in regions where hospital outbreaks have occurred, or to respond to an outbreak in a health-care setting or community. The immune correlates of protection against MERS-CoV have not yet been determined in any species. Immunisation with ChAdOx1 MERS results in rapid induction of immune responses against MERS-CoV, which are maintained for at least 1 year, and might therefore have value in preventing or limiting outbreaks in endemic regions. Further clinical studies, especially in endemic regions, should be done with this vaccine.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para80">The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes an emerging zoonotic viral respiratory disease that was first described in 2012 and is now endemic in Saudi Arabia.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infections varies from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory distress and death. MERS-CoV has since spread to different countries in the Middle East and other regions, with 2519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 866 deaths in 27 countries, reported by Jan 31, 2020.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> MERS-CoV poses a major threat to public health security because of its epidemic potential and absence of currently available effective countermeasures, and it has been listed as a priority pathogen for research and development by WHO and other health agencies around the globe. Dromedary camels are now a recognised source of zoonotic infections, and occupational exposure has been associated with seroconversion,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> although only 40% of primary cases have been associated with direct camel exposure.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Human-to-human transmission, especially in hospital environments, has been responsible for the majority of cases seen in outbreaks in the past 7 years.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, no sustained human-to-human transmission has been recorded so far (overall R<sub>0</sub>&lt;1), and the role of asymptomatic or mild cases in transmission patterns remains controversial and unclear. No specific treatment options or licensed vaccines are currently available.</p>
              <p id="para90">The non-specific clinical features of MERS often lead to delayed diagnosis and increased exposure in health-care facilities, contributing to the persistence of nosocomial outbreaks, which is further complicated by the absence of effective treatment options and suboptimal adherence to infection prevention and control and isolation practices.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Considering the complexities around the implementation of overall control measures for MERS-CoV and the numerous challenges in filling knowledge gaps required to achieve it, vaccination remains the key cost-effective strategy to tackle the global MERS-CoV threat.</p>
              <p id="para100">Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped, large, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes. A fourth of their genome is responsible for coding structural proteins, such as the spike glycoprotein, and envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. Envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins are mainly responsible for virion assembly, whereas the spike glycoprotein is involved in receptor binding, mediating virus entry into host cells during infection via different receptors.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> MERS-CoV belongs to the phylogenetic lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus, and it recognises the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) host receptor, which is well conserved between camels and humans.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> It is the sixth coronavirus known to cause human infections and the first human virus within lineage C. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was responsible for the 2002–03 SARS global epidemic and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the current pandemic, belong to lineage B (genus Betacoronavirus). HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are representatives of lineage A (genus Betacoronavirus), whereas HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 are globally distributed and generally associated with mild respiratory symptoms, accounting for up to a third of all common cold cases.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para110">Spike is a type I, trimeric, transmembrane glycoprotein located at the surface of the viral envelope of coronaviruses, which can be divided into two functional subunits: the N-terminal S1 and the C-terminal S2. S1 and S2 on MERS-CoV are responsible for binding to the host cellular receptor DPP4 via the virus receptor-binding domain (RBD) and fusion of virus and host cell membranes, thereby mediating the entry of MERS-CoV into target cells.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The RBD of MERS-CoV has a core structure, which is homologous to that of SARS-CoV, and a receptor-binding motif, which is specific to MERS-CoV, determining receptor recognition and viral pathogenesis.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The roles of the spike protein in receptor binding and membrane fusion make it an ideal target for vaccine and antiviral development because it is the main target for neutralising antibodies.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para120">ChAdOx1 MERS consists of the replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector ChAdOx1, which has been described elsewhere,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> expressing a codon-optimised coding sequence for the full-length spike protein (S1 and S2 subunits) of the MERS-CoV isolate Camel/Qatar_2_2014 (GenBank, accession number KJ650098.1), including a 32 amino acid N-terminal tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence. Preclinical work has shown that the vaccine is highly immunogenic in animal models, being able to induce both cellular and humoral responses (polyfunctional CD8 T cells and neutralising antibodies).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS also conferred protective efficacy in transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 against a lethal MERS-CoV challenge, which supported progression into clinical development.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Immunogenicity and partial protective efficacy in a natural transmission model in dromedary camels have also been reported.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 MERS candidate MERS-CoV vaccine in humans.</p>

                <p id="para130">This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK). Participants were recruited through advertisements. Healthy people aged 18–50 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies were eligible to participate. A negative urinary pregnancy test was required at screening and immediately before enrolment for all women. Full details of the eligibility criteria are described in the trial protocol provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 42)</xref>.</p>
                <p id="para140">Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the trial was done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. This study was approved in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (reference 21584/0381/001-0001) and the South Central—Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (reference 17/SC/0552). Vaccine use was authorised by the Genetically Modified Organisms Safety Committee of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Trust (reference number GM462.18.101). An independent local safety monitor provided safety oversight.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">The recombinant adenovirus was produced as previously described.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The vaccine was manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practice by the Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK) in a Tet-repressed HEK 293 cell line. The vectored vaccine was purified and sterile filtered to generate a clinical lot at a concentration of 1·74    × 10<sup>11</sup> viral particles per mL.</p>
                <p id="para160">ChAdOx1 MERS was administered as a single intramuscular injection into the deltoid at 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> viral particles (low-dose group), 2·5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles (intermediate-dose group), and 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles (high-dose group). A staggered-enrolment approach was used for the first three participants in each group, and interim safety reviews were done before dose escalation (details provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 49</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para170">Blood samples were drawn and clinical assessments were done for safety as well as immunology endpoints before vaccination at day 0 and subsequently at days 2, 7, 14, 28, 56, 182, and 364 after vaccination. Participants were observed in the clinic for 1 h after the vaccination procedure and were asked to record any adverse events using electronic diaries during the 28-day follow-up period. Swelling at the injection site was objectively assessed by a member of the study team during the study visits.</p>
                <p id="para180">Solicited (ie, expected and defined in the protocol) local site reactions (injection site pain, warmth, redness, swelling, and pruritus) and systemic symptoms (malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, nausea, headache, feverishness, and fever, with a temperature of 37·5°C or higher) were recorded for 7 days by members of the study team and participants. Unsolicited adverse events were all other events not defined as solicited and were recorded for 28 days, and serious adverse events were recorded throughout the follow-up period.</p>
                <p id="para190">Severity of adverse events was graded with the following criteria: mild (mild symptoms with no limitation to usual activity), moderate (mild-to-moderate limitation in usual activity), and severe (considerable limitation in activity, medication or medical attention required). Unsolicited adverse events were reviewed for causality by an independent clinician, and events considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study vaccine were reported. Laboratory adverse events were graded by use of site-specific toxicity tables, which were adapted from the US Food and Drug Administration toxicity grading scale.</p>
                <p id="para200">Total anti-MERS spike IgG, to determine humoral immunity, was measured using a standardised in-house indirect ELISA and MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies. Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) were coated with 1 μg/mL of full-length recombinant clamp MERS spike protein (supplied by Keith Chappell, The School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia) in phosphate buffered saline and incubated at 4°C for 18 h overnight. The coated plates were washed six times with phosphate buffered saline-Tween and then blocked with casein for 1 h at room temperature. Plasma samples diluted to fall within the linear range of the curve (typically 1/500 in casein) were then added to individual wells on the plates. This step was followed by incubation of the plates at room temperature for 2 h and washing of the plates, as initially described. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (γ-chain specific). After a final wash, plates were developed by adding 4-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine substrate buffer (Fisher Scientific UK, Loughborough, UK). The standard curve used on each plate was derived from a pool of volunteers' sera containing high-titre anti-MERS IgG. Endpoint titre determined by ELISA was used to identify the volunteer samples with the highest anti-MERS IgG titres after vaccination. A 1/100 dilution of the standard pool was used in a two-fold serial dilution to produce ten standard points that were assigned arbitrary ELISA units. The optical density values of the standard points were fitted to a four-parameter hyperbolic curve against the arbitrary ELISA units using GEN5 software (version 3.04; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA), and the parameters estimated from the standard curve were used to convert absorbance values of individual test samples into ELISA units. Each ELISA plate consists of the samples and internal positive control (1/800 dilution of the standard pool, corresponding to standard 4) in triplicates, ten standard points in duplicates, and four blank wells. The optical density reading of the plates at 405 nm was done with an ELx808 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments).</p>
                <p id="para210">Neutralising antibodies against live MERS-CoV were measured by use of paired serum samples obtained at day 0 and day 28. Induction of virus-neutralising antibodies was confirmed according to previously published protocols.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Briefly, serum samples were tested for their capacity to neutralise MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 isolate) infections in vitro with 100 50% tissue culture infective doses in Huh-7 cells. Sera were incubated for 1 h with the virus and then added to the cells and incubated for 4 days. A recombinant human monoclonal antibody directed against the RBD of MERS-CoV S1 (MRO-895LC Creative Biolabs, Shirley, NY, USA) served as a neutralisation control. Full neutralisation was observed at a dilution of 1/512 (with or without one dilution step acceptable as inter-assay variation), which corresponds to a concentration of 0·2 μg/mL.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Neutralisation titres were calculated as reciprocal values of geometric mean titres of four replicates. A titre of 8 was considered positive.</p>
                <p id="para220">For the pseudovirus neutralisation assay, MERS-CoV EMC/2012, KOR/KNIH/002, and England-1 (endoplasmic reticulum retention signal-deleted, amino acids 1–1338) pseudotyped lentiviral particles were generated and titrated using lentivirus-associated p24 ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA).<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Two-fold diluted serum was incubated with 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> viral particles of pseudotyped virus for 60 min at 37°C and added to 786-O cells, incubated for 6 h, and replaced with fresh medium; luciferase-reporter activity was measured 3 days later. A commercially available neutralising monoclonal antibody (40069-R723, Sino Biological, Beijing, China) was used as a positive control. All of the samples were analysed in duplicates. Data were expressed as geometric mean with SDs.</p>
                <p id="para230">To assess cellular immunity, interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays were done with fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to determine responses to the MERS-CoV spike vaccine antigen.

The association between the frequency of moderate or severe solicited adverse events and group allocation (intermediate dose and high dose) is reported as relative risk with the respective 95% CIs and p value (Fisher's exact test). Immunology data were tested for normal distribution using the D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test. Data were analysed with non-parametric measures if data were not normally distributed or the sample size was small. Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's multiple comparison post test was used to compare across timepoints or groups. p values of less than 0·05 were considered to be significant. For ELISpot data, values are SFCs per million PBMCs. Statistical analysis of safety and immunogenicity data was done with GraphPad Prism (version 8.01 for Windows).</p>

No serious adverse reactions occurred. The majority of adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity, and all adverse events were self-limiting.

Onset of detectable immune responses was rapid, with T-cell responses peaking 14 days after vaccination and antibodies at 28 days. A small number of participants had positive antibody or T-cell responses (but never both) before vaccination. These pre-exisiting responses are likely to be due to cross-reactivity with other known human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43, all of which circulate worldwide and can cause lower respiratory tract infections.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The prevalence of seropositivity to these four viruses in the UK is unknown, but a cross-sectional survey in the Netherlands found that 100% of children had seroconverted to at least one of these by the age of 10 years, and it is likely that the rate is similar in the UK.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, pre-existing cross-reactive immune responses to human coronaviruses is likely to be an area of further investigation.

Adenoviral vectored vaccines are potent inducers of CD8 T-cell responses, and the phenotype of T cells induced by vaccination will be determined in further studies.</p>
              <p id="para460">MERS-CoV vaccines are required for both camels and humans. ChAdOx1 MERS has been tested in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia and was shown to significantly reduce viral shedding, which could potentially translate into reduced zoonotic transmission.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The One Health vaccine development approach used here, by which the same vaccine is co-developed for humans and susceptible animal species, allows vaccine efficacy to be tested in an appropriate animal model, which could support licensure of the vaccine for humans. Target groups include people who are occupationally exposed to camels and health-care workers. However, severe and fatal cases of MERS-CoV disproportionally affect individuals older than 50 years and those with comorbidities. Therefore, it is paramount that vaccines developed against MERS-CoV are suitable for administration in older age groups in the context of an outbreak. The use of replication-deficient vectors avoids the risks of inadequate attenuation of replication-competent vaccines, which could potentially lead to disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts. Immunogenicity of a ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine against influenza has been demonstrated in older adults (50–78 years of age).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> For use in outbreaks, rapid onset of immunity after a single dose, as demonstrated here, is highly desirable.</p>
              <p id="para470">The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is supporting the clinical development of four novel vaccines against MERS, all of which express the full-length spike glycoprotein. In addition to ChAdOx1 MERS, a DNA vaccine and two other viral vectored vaccines (MVA and measles vectors) are being developed.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Data from early clinical trials will support the use of one or more of these vaccines in the Middle East or as a stockpile suitable for outbreak response in any country.</p>
              <p id="para480">Limitations of this study include the small sample size and the open-label, non-randomised, and uncontrolled trial design. Long-term safety and immunogenicity findings should be interpreted with caution considering that five of 24 participants declined the 12-month extended follow-up. Further research is required to better understand the importance of pre-existing immunity and cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses in the context of emerging coronaviruses outbreaks. Nonetheless, this study provides valuable information on reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the first clinical use of ChAdOx1 MERS.</p>
              <p id="para490">In conclusion, ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV. The results of this first-in-human clinical trial support clinical development progression into phase 1b and 2 trials in the Middle East. Healthy adults, health-care workers, people who are occupationally exposed to camels, and older age groups with comorbidities will be recruited and assessed for safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 MERS to be given as a single or two-dose administration regimen.</p>
