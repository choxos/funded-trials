                  <p id="Par1">Daily testing using a rapid Lateral Flow Device (LFD) has been suggested as an alternative to self-isolation. A randomised trial comparing daily contact testing (DCT) in schools with self-isolation found that SARS-CoV-2 transmission within school was comparable and low in both groups. However, if this approach is to be adopted widely, it is critical that we understand the perspective of those who will be delivering and receiving DCT. The aim of this qualitative process study embedded in the randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to improve understanding of a range of behavioural factors that could influence implementation.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Interviews were conducted with 63 participants, including staff, students, and parents of students who had been identified as being in close contact with someone with COVID-19. The topic guide explored perceptions of daily testing, understanding of positive and negative test results, and adherence to guidance. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Results were organised under three main headings: (1) factors influencing daily testing (2) interpretation of test results (3) behaviour during testing period. Participants recognized that daily testing may allow students to remain in school, which was viewed as necessary for both education and social needs. Whilst some felt safer as a result of daily testing, others raised concerns about safety. Participants did not always understand how to interpret and respond to test results, and although participants reported high levels of adherence to the guidance, improved communications were desired.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Daily testing may be a feasible and acceptable alternative to self-isolation among close contacts of people who test positive. However, improved communications are needed to ensure that all students and parents have a good understanding of the rationale for testing, what test results mean, how test results should be acted on, and how likely students are to test positive following close contact. Support is needed for students and parents of students who have to self-isolate and for those who have concerns about the safety of daily testing.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">At the time that this study was conducted in the UK, when a case of COVID-19 was identified within a school or college all close contacts of the case were required to self-isolate at home for 10 days. In some situations, the number of close contacts could be quite large. Self-isolation could therefore have considerable negative impacts on the education, psychological health and wellbeing of those affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is also possible that preventing students from attending school may not lead to effective isolation, since there is some evidence that suggests that compliance with self-isolation outside the school setting may be as low as 11% in asymptomatic contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Daily testing using a rapid Lateral Flow Device (LFD) has been suggested as an alternative to self-isolation. This involves close contacts of a confirmed case being offered the option to take an LFD every day for up to 7 days. Tests are taken at school at the start of the school day, and those with a negative test result can remain in school. A person who tests positive with LFD follows national protocols and self-isolates for 10 days. This approach has been piloted elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with evidence suggesting that it may be acceptable and feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Data from a randomised trial of daily contact testing (DCT) in schools carried out during a period of high infection rates in the UK suggests that DCT was not inferior to self-isolation for controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, if this approach is to be implemented widely, it is critical that we understand the perspective of those who will be delivering and receiving DCT. The aim of the qualitative process study reported here, which was nested within the RCT, was to improve understanding of a range of behavioural factors, including reasons for participating, response to negative and positive test results, and compliance with self-isolation.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p id="Par8">We conducted interviews with students, parents of students, and staff in a sample of the schools involved in daily testing.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Sampling and data collection</title>
                <p id="Par9">We asked a key contact in all schools that were involved in the trial of daily testing to invite staff, students, and parents of students who had been identified as being in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 to take part in an interview with the research team. Interested participants were directed to an online form where they provided their contact details, the name of their school, the year group of the student, and whether or not they/their child had taken part in daily testing. We then used a purposive sampling strategy that aimed for diversity in whether or not the participant (or participant’s child) had taken part in daily testing, school size and location, and year group of the student. We sampled from a range of locations to ensure we sampled participants from schools with high infection rates (including new variants), as infection rates varied considerably between school districts and were typically higher in districts with greater deprivation. Selected participants were contacted by email and provided with an information sheet about the study.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Interviews were conducted remotely (online or by telephone) by a trained qualitative researcher from the University of Bristol (SD, LT, GTE, BA, and RB). Our initial topic guide (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) was informed by previous work in which we explore barriers and facilitators to daily testing among close contacts of covid cases in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and was designed to explore experiences of the testing process, beliefs about testing, perceptions of positive and negative test results, and impact of testing on behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In order to encourage participants to speak openly about their views and behaviour during the testing period, participants were informed that the interviews would be anonymous and their behaviour would not be disclosed even if they had not always adhered to the guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, participants were reminded that the research team would be obliged to notify authorities if the participant revealed any intended or planned breaches of COVID-19 regulations that could put others in danger.</p>

                <p id="Par11">Transcriptions of the audio-recorded interviews were anonymised and imported into NVivo software. Data were analysed in accordance with the stages of thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. First, transcripts were read repeatedly by two authors (SD, LT), and interesting concepts and ideas were noted. All text were then labelled with an initial set of codes, with team members meeting regularly to discuss coding and to generate an initial thematic structure. With reference to existing literature, similar themes were grouped together and refined. The relevant data for each were then collated, enabling the team to check the data against the theme. During the final stage, themes were named and defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par26">There was considerable variation in participants’ perceptions of the safety of daily testing. One of the biggest concerns among participants was the potentially increased risk of transmission during the testing period. This included concerns about students passing the virus to others, and students being at a greater risk of catching the virus from others during the testing period:</p>

                <title>Summary of findings</title>
                <p id="Par145">To our knowledge this is the first study to qualitatively explore perceptions of daily testing in schools as an alternative to self-isolation following close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Our work reveals that use of DCT may be supported by those who are motivated to enable school attendance and avoid self-isolation, and who perceive the risks of testing to be low for them and their contacts. However, we also identified a number of situations in which self-isolation may be preferred. In particular, staff and students who favour home working/studying, were concerned about disruption following a positive test result, or were concerned about transmission of the virus during the testing period were more likely to opt to self-isolate.</p>
                <p id="Par146">Previous research suggests that staff, students and parents are concerned about perceived risks of missed learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and that these concerns may outweigh concerns about transmission of the virus. In the current study, many participants were keen to avoid periods of isolation and remain at school. In particular, students in critical (exam) years, those who value school attendance, and those who had experienced previous periods of self-isolation appeared most accepting of DCT as an approach to reduce periods of school absence. However, some participants were not convinced that the need to keep students in school did outweigh the risks of transmission in schools, and for these individuals additional information and reassurance about the safety of testing may be needed. Furthermore, some students described substantial benefits of remote learning, appreciating the opportunity to work at their own pace in an environment free of distractions.</p>
                <p id="Par147">Whilst previous work identified support for COVID-19 testing in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] it was not clear whether daily testing following close contact with the virus would be equally supported. In the current study, perceptions of the safety of DCT varied considerably between participants, and was often based on a complex and sophisticated evaluation of their perceived risk of exposure and the perceived vulnerability of those around them. Some students thought that the risk that they had already caught COVID-19 was high due to close contact with the confirmed case and so did not think attending school would increase their risk, but they wanted the reassurance of a daily test result to confirm that they were not transmitting the virus to members of their household. However, those considering themselves likely to have already caught COVID-19 could be motivated to avoid schools (and self-isolate) if in close contact with vulnerable staff and students within the school setting. Likewise, some students decided to self-isolate because they thought they were unlikely to have caught COVID-19 from the confirmed case, and considered themselves/their households to be at greater risk if they attended school and were in close contact with others who may have COVID-19. Conversely, other students who considered themselves unlikely to have contracted the virus could actually demonstrate an increased willingness to attend school, considering the perceived lack of contact with the person who tested positive, as they considered themselves unlikely to be of risk to others.</p>
                <p id="Par148">In line with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], some parents and pupils were concerned about the risk of a positive test, which could extend their isolation period, and/or have a negative impact on the household (who would also have to isolate). In some cases, accepting that the child would be isolating for 10 days was preferable to facing the uncertainty of not knowing whether their child would be sent home each day. Due to limited resources, schools were not always able to communicate test results with parents, and this often added to the uncertainty and prevented planning. Improved communications between schools and parents may reduce the uncertainty to some degree. Furthermore, evidence suggests that rates of COVID-19 in school-based contacts are very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Communication of such findings may alleviate concerns about having to isolate following positive test results. There is also a continued need for improved support for those who do need to self-isolate following positive test results.</p>
                <p id="Par149">Whilst nearly all participants accepted that tests were not conclusive evidence of COVID-19 status, a range of estimates were given regarding their accuracy to predict presence or absence of the virus. Participants were more likely to accept a negative test result as accurate if they had not been in close contact with the confirmed case, had no symptoms, and had taken multiple tests (with the same result). Confidence was weakened through exposure to dis-concordant test results. In order to increase confidence in testing, some participants reported behaviours such as taking multiple LFD tests or a PCR test. Previous research has also highlighted confusion over which tests should be used and when [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Provision of accessible information regarding the best way to use tests and how to interpret and respond to uncertain or conflicting test results could help increase understanding, confidence and appropriate use of tests.</p>
                <p id="Par150">Many parents and students had a good understanding of the risks and limitations of daily testing, and the implications for managing the residual risk to others. Our research is consistent with previous qualitative research that also suggested that testing did not increase high risk behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Indeed, in the current study, the majority of participants reported adhering to the guidance or only engaging in low-risk activities, with efforts being made to avoid contact with vulnerable individuals. However, research conducted by the Office for National Statistics found that parents were concerned about the effects of isolation on their child’s mental wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and this could lead to non-adherent behaviour for the sake of the child’s welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, within the current study, breaches of regulations appeared to be the result of an assessment of the dis/advantages of ‘breaking the rules’ in terms of the effect it would have on their child’s mental health, whilst simultaneously attempting to minimise risk as much as possible.</p>
                <p id="Par151">Much research has highlighted the detrimental impact of the introduction of infection control measures without sufficient explanation and justification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Within the current study there was evidence of confusion about why behaviours were permitted in some settings and not others, and how to interpret apparently contradictory test results. Without further clarity and explanation, these perceived mixed messages may weaken adherence overtime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Accessible information about what positive and negative test results mean, how accurate tests are, and the rules and regulations for relating to contact outside of school hours during the testing period may be critical.</p>
                <p id="Par152">Participants in the current study represented a wide range of schools in England, and there appeared to be considerable variation in the resources available, and capacity for daily testing. In particular, schools with limited space often struggled with the logistics of onsite testing, particularly when case numbers were high. Staff working in schools in more deprived areas also reported additional resources were needed for delivering daily testing, communicating information about daily testing, and ensuring communications were accessible for those with lower levels of literacy. This appeared to substantially influence the feasibility of daily testing, and must be taken into consideration if daily testing is to be offered to schools more widely.</p>

              <sec id="Sec20">
                <title>Limitations of the study</title>
                <p id="Par153">The main limitation of this study is that, despite purposive diversity sampling, it is likely that people with more negative views of and less engagement with daily testing may have been under-represented in our sample as they would be less likely to engage with research. It should also be noted that at the time the research was conducted, lateral flow tests were freely available. Although vaccines were being offered to adults, children were not eligible to receive a vaccination themselves. These factors may influence acceptability of DCT and our findings must be interpreted with this in mind. Finally, whilst participants in the study were often willing to share occasions during which they were unable to adhere to the guidance, it is possible that non-adherent behaviours were underreported by those who did not feel comfortable disclosing this information to the research team.</p>

                <title>Implications for policy and practice</title>
                <p id="Par154">Many students, staff and parents are motivated and competent to implement daily testing appropriately to enable school attendance. However, the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a policy of daily testing may vary between households and schools, and may also vary depending on the context of local infection levels (since these affect perceptions of the risks involved). Better and more accessible communications are needed to ensure that all students and parents have a good understanding of the rationale for testing, what test results mean (including their level of accuracy and limitations), how test results should be acted on, and how likely students are to become infected following close contact. Particular attention is needed to improve acceptability and feasibility of testing in schools and households with lower levels of IT literacy and health literacy.</p>
                <p id="Par155">The option of daily testing of contacts may be beneficial for those who require reassurance to reduce anxiety about transmission from school contacts to vulnerable household members. However, concern about a positive test resulting in a longer self-isolation period or the need for other household members to self-isolate poses a barrier to the acceptability of testing, especially in households with less resources for self-isolation.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par156">This study suggests that DCT may be a feasible and acceptable alternative to self-isolation among close contacts of COVID-19 cases. Participants were motivated to keep children in school but raised concerns about the safety of daily testing in some circumstances. Improved communications are needed to ensure that all students and parents have a good understanding of the rationale for testing, what test results mean, how test results should be acted on, and how likely students are to be a case following close contact. Support is needed for students and parents of students who have to self-isolate and for those who have concerns about the safety of DCT for their household.</p>
