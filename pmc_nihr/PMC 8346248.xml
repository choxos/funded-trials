                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Use of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules could facilitate mass COVID-19 immunisation. However, we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer–BioNTech; hereafter referred to as BNT) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules. Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous schedules with the ChAd and BNT vaccines.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Com-COV is a participant-blinded, randomised, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Adults aged 50 years and older with no or well controlled comorbidities and no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by laboratory confirmation were eligible and were recruited at eight sites across the UK. The majority of eligible participants were enrolled into the general cohort (28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals), who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT, or BNT/ChAd, administered at either 28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals. A small subset of eligible participants (n=100) were enrolled into an immunology cohort, who had additional blood tests to evaluate immune responses; these participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to the four schedules (28-day interval only). Participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the prime-boost interval. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration (measured by ELISA) at 28 days after boost, when comparing ChAd/BNT with ChAd/ChAd, and BNT/ChAd with BNT/BNT. The heterologous schedules were considered non-inferior to the approved homologous schedules if the lower limit of the one-sided 97·5% CI of the GMR of these comparisons was greater than 0·63. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done among participants receiving at least one dose of a study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 69254139.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 11 and Feb 26, 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 participants with a 28-day prime-boost interval, for whom results are reported here. The mean age of participants was 57·8 years (SD 4·7), with 212 (46%) female participants and 117 (25%) from ethnic minorities. At day 28 post boost, the geometric mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in ChAd/BNT recipients (12 906 ELU/mL) was non-inferior to that in ChAd/ChAd recipients (1392 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 9·2 (one-sided 97·5% CI 7·5 to ∞). In participants primed with BNT, we did not show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (BNT/ChAd, 7133 ELU/mL) against the homologous schedule (BNT/BNT, 14 080 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 0·51 (one-sided 97·5% CI 0·43 to ∞). Four serious adverse events occurred across all groups, none of which were considered to be related to immunisation.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Despite the BNT/ChAd regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (ChAd/ChAd) with proven efficacy against COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation. Along with the higher immunogenicity of ChAd/BNT compared with ChAD/ChAd, these data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using ChAd and BNT COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

                <p id="para30">National regulatory authorities have granted emergency use authorisations for more than 15 vaccines, among which six vaccines have been approved for emergency use by WHO. Although more than 3·8 billion COVID-19 vaccines have been administered as of July 30, 2021, only approximately 28% of the global population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with approximately 1·1% of the population in low-income countries having received a vaccine dose. Heterologous COVID-19 vaccine schedules have the potential to accelerate vaccine roll-out worldwide, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. We searched PubMed for research articles published between database inception and June 22, 2021, using the search terms “(COVID) AND (heterologous) AND (vaccin*) NOT (BCG)” with no language restrictions. In addition to our previously published reactogenicity results, we identified two animal studies using combinations of mRNA, adenoviral vectored, inactivated, and recombinant protein vaccines as prime-boost schedules. Both studies showed robust humoral and cellular responses induced by heterologous schedules in mice. In addition, we identified two clinical trials on the rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost schedule (Sputnik V, Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology), showing good safety profiles, strong humoral or cellular responses, and 91·6% vaccine efficacy. Another clinical trial, which randomly assigned participants primed with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca; ChAd) to receive BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech; BNT) as the boost vaccine or no boost vaccination, reported a robust immune response and an acceptable reactogenicity profile, but with no comparison to a homologous vaccine schedule. A further two preprint articles of cohort studies evaluating ChAd prime and BNT boost schedules showed similar results.</p>

The cellular and humoral responses of the two heterologous vaccine schedules at 28 days after the boost dose are no lower than those of the ChAd/ChAd schedule, which has shown to be highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19 disease, and no safety concerns were raised.</p>

                <p id="para70">Now that multiple COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for emergency use, the paramount issue in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic is to optimise global vaccine coverage using the currently available vaccines. The results from our study support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost schedules with ChAd and BNT, which could accelerate vaccine roll-out in some settings. Further studies are needed to examine other heterologous schedules, especially those using vaccines that are being deployed in low-income and middle-income countries.</p>

              <p id="para100">Although the Sputnik V vaccine programme, which deploys a heterologous prime-boost schedule using Ad26 and Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccines, induces a robust humoral and cellular response and has shown 91·6% efficacy against symptomatic disease,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> there are currently no efficacy data using heterologous schedules incorporating COVID-19 vaccines across different platforms. Nevertheless, preclinical studies support evaluation of this approach,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and results from a randomised study in Spain suggested an increase in binding and neutralising antibody after boosting ChAd-primed participants with BNT, compared with not having a boost dose.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Additionally, early results from an observational study in Germany show that humoral responses are similar in the cohort receiving BNT/BNT at a 3-week interval to those receiving ChAd/BNT at a 10-week interval, with cellular responses appearing to be higher in the ChAd/BNT cohort.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However, we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating ChAd and BNT are more reactogenic than their homologous schedules.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para110">Robust data on the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous vaccine schedules will help inform the use of these schedules in individuals who develop a contraindication to a specific vaccine after their first dose, and for vaccine programmes looking to mitigate vaccine supply chain disruption or changes in guidance for vaccine usage. In addition, mixed schedules might induce an enhanced or more durable humoral or cellular immune response compared with licensed schedules, and might do so against a greater range of SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
              <p id="para120">Accordingly, we did a randomised controlled trial to determine whether the immune responses to heterologous schedules with the ChAd and BNT vaccines are non-inferior to their equivalent homologous schedules.</p>

The trial was reviewed and approved by the South-Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (21/SC/0022), the University of Oxford, and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.</p>
                <p id="para140">Four permutations of prime-boost schedules using the ChAd and BNT vaccines are compared, at two different prime-boost intervals (28 days and 84 days) to reflect both short and long interval approaches to immunisation. The majority of participants were enrolled into the general cohort, in which participants could be randomly assigned to receive the four vaccine schedules at either a 28-day or 84-day interval. A subset of participants (n=100, selected on the basis of site capacity and participant availability) were enrolled into an immunology cohort, in which participants were randomly assigned only to vaccine schedules with a 28-day interval and had four additional blood tests to explore the kinetics of the immune responses. Here, we report data from all participants who were randomly assigned to vaccine schedules with a prime-boost interval of 28 days.

                <p id="para260">The sample size was calculated assuming the SD of the primary endpoint to be 0·4 at log<sub>10</sub> scale and the true geometric mean ratio (GMR) between the homologous and heterologous group to be one. The study needed to recruit 115 participants per group to achieve 90% power at a one-sided 2<bold>·</bold>5% significance level, after adjusting for an attrition rate of 25% due to baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity or loss to follow-up.</p>
                <p id="para270">The primary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG was done in participants boosted at day 28 on a per-protocol basis. The analysis population was participants who were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (defined by anti-nucleocapsid IgG negativity at day 0 and no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 14 days after prime vaccination), whose primary endpoint data were available, and who had no protocol deviations. The GMR was calculated as the antilogarithm of the difference between the mean of the log<sub>10</sub> transformed SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in the heterologous group and that in the homologous group (as the reference), after adjusting for study site and cohort (immunology or general) as randomisation design variables in the linear regression model. The GMRs were reported separately for participants primed with ChAd and those with BNT, with a one-sided 97·5% CI to adjust for multiple testing because two primary comparisons were made. The criterion for non-inferiority of heterologous boost compared with homologous boost was for the lower limit of the one-sided 97·5% CI of the GMR to be greater than 0·63; this cutoff was chosen on a pragmatic basis to approach the WHO criterion of 0·67 for licensing new vaccines when using GMR as the primary endpoint, while still allowing rapid study delivery.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>

                <p id="para280">According to recommended practice for non-inferiority trials,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> we also present the two-sided 95% CI of the adjusted GMRs among the modified intention-to-treat population, which followed the per-protocol population definition but included participants whose visit timelines fell outside protocol windows, to allow a conservative estimation for superiority comparison, as secondary analyses. The heterologous group was considered superior to the homologous group if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than one, and the homologous group was considered superior to the heterologous group if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI was less than one. The geometric means of secondary immunological outcomes were reported in the modified intention-to-treat population. The proportions of participants with responses higher than the lower limit of detection or higher than the lower limit of quantification were calculated by vaccine schedule, with 95% CIs calculated by the binomial exact method for each secondary immunological outcome, and compared between heterologous and homologous groups using Fisher's exact test. Censored data reported to be below the lower limit of detection or lower limit of quantification were imputed with a value equal to half of the threshold before transformation. Between-schedule comparisons of immunological outcomes were evaluated by linear regression models adjusting for study site and cohort as secondary analyses. If a normal distribution could not be rendered after transformation, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used. Correlations between different immunological outcomes were evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficients.</p>

              <p id="para340">Among participants primed with ChAd, the geometric mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG at 28 days post boost vaccination was 1392 ELU/mL (95% CI 1188 to 1630) in the homologous vaccine schedule group (ChAd/ChAd) and 12 906 ELU/mL (11 404 to 14 604) in the heterologous group (ChAd/BNT), with a GMR of 9·2 (one-sided 97·5% CI 7·5 to ∞) between heterologous and homologous groups in the per-protocol analysis (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>
). The lower limit of the one-sided 97·5% CI of the GMR was greater than the margin of 0·63, indicating non-inferiority of ChAd/BNT compared with ChAd/ChAd. Similar SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations were observed in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, with a GMR of 9·3 (two-sided 95% CI 7·7 to 11·4). The GMR of MNA NT<sub>50</sub> between the heterologous and homologous groups was 6·4 (two-sided 95% CI 5·2 to 7·8) and the GMR of PNA NT<sub>50</sub> was 8·5 (6·5 to 11·0) in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Cellular responses by T-cell ELISpot were greater for ChAd/BNT than ChAd/ChAd, with a GMR of 3·9 (2·9 to 5·3; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). These results indicate that the ChAd/BNT schedule was statistically superior to the ChAd/ChAd schedule in terms of the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG, MNA NT<sub>50</sub>, PNA NT<sub>50</sub>, and cellular responses.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Immune responses by vaccine schedule at 28 days post boost dose (56 days post prime) in the 28-day prime-boost interval study groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th colspan="3" align="left"><bold>Prime with ChAd</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="3" align="left"><bold>Prime with BNT</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th/><th/><th align="left">ChAd/ChAd</th><th align="left">ChAd/BNT</th><th align="left">GMR<xref rid="tbl2fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></th><th align="left">BNT/BNT</th><th align="left">BNT/ChAd</th><th align="left">GMR<xref rid="tbl2fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="8" align="left"><bold>Per-protocol analysis</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">N</td><td align="left">104</td><td align="left">104</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">109</td><td align="left">109</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG, ELU/mL</td><td align="left">1392 (1188 to 1630)</td><td align="left">12 906 (11 404 to 14 604)</td><td align="left">9·2 (97·5% CI 7·5 to ∞)</td><td align="left">14 080 (12 491 to 15 871)</td><td align="left">7133 (6415 to 7932)</td><td align="left">0·51 (97·5% CI 0·43 to ∞)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8" align="left"><bold>Modified intention-to-treat analysis</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">N</td><td align="left">105</td><td align="left">108</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">110</td><td align="left">109</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8" align="left">SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">n</td><td align="left">105</td><td align="left">108</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">110</td><td align="left">109</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Concentration, ELU/mL</td><td align="left">1387 (1186 to 1623)</td><td align="left">12 995 (11 520 to 14 660)</td><td align="left">9·3 (95% CI 7·7 to 11·4)</td><td align="left">13 938 (12 358 to 15 719)</td><td align="left">7133 (6415 to 7932)</td><td align="left">0·51 (95% CI 0·44 to 0·60)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8" align="left">Live virus neutralising antibody</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">n</td><td align="left">98</td><td align="left">104</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Normalised NT<sub>50</sub></td><td align="left">201 (171 to 235)</td><td align="left">1269 (1107 to 1454)</td><td align="left">6·4 (95% CI 5·2 to 7·8)</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8" align="left">Pseudotype virus neutralising antibody</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">n</td><td align="left">101</td><td align="left">101</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">102</td><td align="left">104</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">NT<sub>50</sub></td><td align="left">61 (50 to 73)</td><td align="left">515 (430 to 617)</td><td align="left">8·5 (95% CI 6·5 to 11·0)</td><td align="left">574 (475 to 694)</td><td align="left">383 (317 to 463)</td><td align="left">0·67 (95% CI 0·51 to 0·88)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8" align="left">Cellular response</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">n</td><td align="left">104</td><td align="left">108</td><td align="left">..</td><td align="left">110</td><td align="left">109</td><td align="left">..</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">SFC per million PBMCs</td><td align="left">48 (37 to 61)</td><td align="left">184 (152 to 223)</td><td align="left">3·9 (95% CI 2·9 to 5·3)</td><td align="left">80 (63 to 101)</td><td align="left">97 (76 to 125)</td><td align="left">1·2 (95% CI 0·87 to 1·7)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data shown are geometric mean (95% CI) for continuous variables.

The study therefore failed to show non-inferiority of BNT/ChAd compared with BNT/BNT.

At 28 days post prime, the concentration was 555 ELU/mL (469–657) in participants primed with ChAd and 1597 ELU/mL (1407–1812) in participants primed with BNT (p&lt;0·0001).</p>
              <p id="para390">By contrast, ChAd induced significantly higher cellular responses at 14 days (p&lt;0·0001) and 28 days (p&lt;0·0001) post prime vaccination compared with BNT: geometric mean at 14 days was 159 SFC per million PBMCs (95% CI 119–211) for ChAd versus 32 SFC per million PBMCs (22–47) for BNT, and at 28 days was 53 SFC per million PBMCs (44–63) for ChAd versus 15 SFC per million PBMCs (13–18) for BNT.</p>

Participants boosted with ChAd after BNT prime (BNT/ChAd) had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG (p&lt;0·0001) and PNA NT<sub>50</sub> (p&lt;0·0001) than those primed with ChAd (ChAd/ChAd). Homologous BNT/BNT immunisation generated higher binding antibodies at day 7 (p&lt;0·0001) and day 28 (p&lt;0·0001) post boost compared with ChAd/ChAd, with a difference also observed in PNA at day 28 post boost (p&lt;0·0001).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para440">Our findings show that all four schedules studied induced concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations at least as high as those induced after a licensed ChAd/ChAd schedule, which is effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 when administered at a 4–12-week prime-boost interval.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Nevertheless, the BNT-containing schedules were more immunogenic than the homologous ChAd/ChAd schedule, and none of the heterologous schedules generated binding or pseudotype virus neutralising antibodies greater than those induced by BNT/BNT immunisation. Cellular immune responses in the BNT vaccine-containing schedules were similarly all at least as high as the ChAd/ChAd group, with BNT/ChAd showing the greatest expansion of vaccine-antigen responsive T cells in the peripheral circulation at 28 days post boost.</p>
              <p id="para450">Although the 28-day homologous ChAd/ChAd schedule was the least immunogenic of the four schedules in our trial, data from a phase 3 randomised clinical trial showed this 4-week interval regimen to be 76% (95% CI 68–82) efficacious against symptomatic disease, and 100% efficacious against severe disease.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> This schedule is known to be more immunogenic when administered at an 8–12-week schedule.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> When deployed in this manner, efficacy against hospitalisation has been shown to be 86% (53–96) due to infection with the alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and 92% (75–97) with the delta variant (B.1.617.2),<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and efficacy against symptomatic infection has been shown to be 66% (54–75) with the alpha variant and 60% (95% CI 29–77) with the delta variant. Given the established associations between humoral responses and vaccine efficacy,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> our findings indicate that the two heterologous schedules in this trial are also likely to be highly effective, and could be considered, in some circumstances, for national vaccine programmes.</p>
              <p id="para460">Our results for the ChAd/BNT schedule build on preliminary data from a Spanish randomised trial, in which 18–60-year-olds received a dose of BNT 2–3 months after priming with ChAd and showed a 37-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG at 14 days post boost, higher than the 22-fold increase at 7 days and 19-fold increase at 28 days post boost in this study.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Potential explanations for these differences include the longer prime-boost interval, the different sampling timepoints, and a younger population in the Spanish study.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Fold increases in the cellular response were, however, similar (four-fold in the Spanish study versus 3·7-fold in this study). Early results from a prospective cohort study in Germany, which compared health-care workers immunised with BNT/BNT at a 3-week interval or ChAd/BNT at an 8–12 week interval, showed similar concentrations of binding antibody at 3 weeks post boost and higher cellular responses in the ChAd/BNT recipients.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Another German cohort study of 26 participants aged 25–46 years receiving a ChAd/BNT schedule with an 8-week prime-boost interval reported a robust humoral immune response, with a suggestion of better retention of neutralising activity against beta (B.1.351) and delta variants than that observed in a non-randomised cohort receiving BNT/BNT.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para470">Together with the finding that the T-cell ELISpot readouts are similar between schedules, the immunological data presented here provide reassurance that ChAd/BNT and BNT/ChAd are acceptable schedule options. However, in contrast with recent non-randomised and non-blinded studies, we did observe increased reactogenicity in the 28-day ChAd/BNT schedule,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> compared with ChAd/ChAd. This discrepancy could be due to the variation in the prime-boost interval, and the forthcoming data from the 84-day prime-boost interval participants in this trial will help to delineate this difference. Although these mild-to-moderate symptoms were transient, they do need to be taken into consideration when deploying the ChAd/BNT schedule, especially in individuals younger than the participants enrolled in this study, given the reported trend towards increased reactogenicity with decreasing age.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Additional considerations for deployment of mixed schedules include potential logistical challenges within the health-care infrastructure, as well as the complex public communications surrounding this strategy.</p>
              <p id="para480">Numerous other randomised heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine studies are now underway or planned,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> including Com-COV2, which incorporates vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Novavax.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Crucially, several of these studies include vaccines manufactured by CanSinoBIO, Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, and Sinovac that are extensively used in low-income and middle-income countries, which are potentially more likely to rely on mixed schedules. These data on heterologous vaccination will also inform third-dose booster immunisation programmes, currently being considered in preparation for the northern hemisphere 2021–22 winter<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and being studied in the ongoing COV-Boost study.</p>
              <p id="para490">This study has several limitations. First, as an immunogenicity and reactogenicity study, the sample size is not adequate to assess vaccine schedule efficacy. Although there is evidence that both binding and neutralising antibodies correlate well with protection against symptomatic disease,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> the extent to which variations in these measures above a specific, unknown, threshold affect protection against severe disease is unclear. Similarly, we are unable, at this point, to determine whether higher antibody concentrations measured at 28 days post boost immunisation will result in a more sustained elevation of vaccine-induced antibodies (as might be expected), and this will be evaluated at study visits up to 1-year post enrolment. An additional limitation is the generalisability of these results to a younger population given the age (50–70 years) of participants in this trial. Previous randomised trials on homologous schedules of viral vector and mRNA vaccines reported similar post-boost immunogenicity between younger (18–55 years) and older (&gt;55 years) adults, and higher reactogenicity in younger cohorts,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and there is no reason to expect this pattern would be different for the heterologous schedules, but it has not been extensively shown. Lastly, the data presented here were from schedules with a 28-day prime-boost interval, whereas the WHO recommended interval for ChAd/ChAd is 8–12 weeks.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> A longer prime-boost interval is reported to result in a higher post-boost SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG response for ChAd/ChAd<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> and for BNT/BNT,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> but it is unknown how lengthening the prime-boost interval will affect the heterologous schedules in this study. This question will be addressed when the immunogenicity data for the schedules including boosting at 84 days become available.</p>
              <p id="para500">In conclusion, our study confirms that the heterologous and homologous schedules of ChAd and BNT can induce robust immune responses with a 4-week prime boost interval. These results support flexibility in deploying mRNA and viral vectored vaccines, subject to supply and logistical considerations, and emphasise the importance of obtaining information on other mixed schedules with different prime-boost intervals, especially for vaccines being deployed in low-income and middle-income countries.</p>
