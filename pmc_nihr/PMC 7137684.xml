                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Does a smartphone application that prompts monthly skin self-monitoring result in individuals with increased risk of melanoma having more timely or more frequent family practice consultations for skin changes?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi200001-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this phase 2 randomized clinical trial of 238 participants, there were no significant differences in skin consultation rates, measures of skin self-monitoring, or psychological harm.</p>

                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>Because there was no evidence that a smartphone application increased skin self-examination or health care consulting rates among a family practice population at increased risk of melanoma, its implementation is not yet recommended.</p>

Population approaches to reducing incidence have focused on mass media campaigns to promote earlier presentation and potentially improve melanoma outcomes; however, interventions using smartphone applications targeting those with the greatest risk could promote earlier presentation to health care professionals for individuals with new or changing skin lesions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Melanoma is among the most lethal forms of skin cancer.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> While it accounts for less than 5% of all cutaneous malignant neoplasms worldwide, melanoma is responsible for most skin cancer deaths.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Internationally, melanoma has among the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In the United States, during the 7 years from 2009 to 2016, raw incidence rates per 100 000 residents climbed from 22.2 to 23.6, with an estimated 76 380 new cases in 2016.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In England, in the decade from 2007 to 2016, age-standardized incidence increased by 37%, with 13 748 new cases and 1937 deaths in 2016.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Melanoma is largely preventable; more than 80% of newly diagnosed melanomas are associated with an increase in recreational sun exposure and tanning bed use.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200001r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Melanoma is also largely curable, with 5-year net-standardized survival of 100% for stage-1 tumors, and most tumors among patients with melanoma are stage-1 tumors.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, among patients presenting with later-stage disease, overall survival rates fall significantly, and once the disease has spread beyond surgical intervention, metastatic melanoma remains largely incurable despite the recent introduction of systemic therapies extending survival.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200001r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There is growing evidence that time to patient presentation to health care and initial management in primary care are key determinants of patient outcomes for most cancers.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200001r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Compared with other cancers, melanoma has among the longest delays measured as median time to patient presentation.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200001r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> To understand possible reasons, recent studies have explored symptom appraisal and help-seeking among individuals recently diagnosed with melanoma. Factors contributing to later presentation to health care include having limited awareness of the seriousness of some skin changes, considering changes in skin as part of normal aging, and having concerns about wasting their own and their general practitioners’ time.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Mass media campaigns have been the main population approach to reduce sun exposure and improve time to presentation. In Australia, public health campaigns such as Slip-Slap-Slop have been highly effective in primary prevention, and incidence rates for new melanoma are plateauing.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Mass media approaches in the United Kingdom, such as SunSmart and the Be Clear on Cancer Skin Cancer campaign, have been less effective in reducing sun exposure or promoting consultations to health care. Initiatives in the United States have focused on educational and clinician-led approaches to minimizing exposure among children and young adults with fair skin types to UV radiation.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Routine screening of the general population is not currently recommended internationally, although some countries (eg, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands) recommend regular skin checks and/or self-examination for certain subsets of patients with increased risk of melanoma.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>More targeted interventions aimed at individuals with increased risk of melanoma could promote earlier presentation to health care. There is a great deal of interest in new technological approaches, such as smartphone applications. People have increasing access to smartphone applications; in 2017, more than 77% of the US and UK populations owned a smartphone.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Smartphone applications can be used to inform prevention and awareness messages, photograph skin lesions, and monitor possible skin changes.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We have demonstrated that it is possible to use a simple patient-completed risk assessment tool in the UK family practice setting to stratify the population into those with population risk and those with increased risk of melanoma.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Individuals with increased risk could receive targeted interventions to promote earlier presentation to health care.</p>
              <p>We chose the MySkinPal app as an exemplar for this study, following extensive phase 1 evaluation. Having reviewed the availability of potentially suitable smartphone skin self-monitoring (SSM) applications, also known as skin self-examination (SSE) applications,<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> we undertook qualitative research, using focus groups and interviews, with individuals with increased risk of melanoma to provide in-depth understanding of consumer views on the usefulness and usability of 2 short-listed applications. MySkinPal was selected for its superior ease of use, including photography, straightforward instructions, and built-in notifications to complete future skin self-monitoring<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (eFigure in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200001-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>). We aimed to test the SSM application in a family practice population with increased risk of melanoma and measure its effect on time to consultation and consultation rates for skin changes.</p>

                <p>This individually randomized phase 2 clinical trial was conducted in 12 family practices in Eastern England. Eligible participants were general practice attendees aged 18 to 75 years who owned a smartphone and were identified as having increased risk of melanoma after completing an electronic questionnaire (ie, MelaTools Q risk assessment tool<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>) using tablet computers. Participants were able to read and write English and give informed consent. Exclusion criteria were having a severe psychiatric or cognitive disorder or a physical disorder severe enough to inhibit the use of a smartphone. Potentially eligible patients were given a trial appointment at their general practice. Randomization was performed after written informed consent had been obtained.</p>

                <p>We collected information on sociodemographic and clinical variables as follows: age, sex, marital status, postcode, highest educational level, occupation, history of skin cancer, skin and hair type, and number of raised moles on both arms at baseline.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200001r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The coprimary clinical outcomes of this trial were as follows: (1) family practice consultation rates and (2) patient interval (ie, time between first noticing a change and consultation<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>) for any skin changes or pigmented skin lesions. Data on consultations in the year before the trial and for 12 months after the trial consultation were collected through audits of general practitioner medical records. Data on the patient interval were measured using the Skin Questionnaire. This self-completed questionnaire, based on the Symptom instrument,<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200001r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200001r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> obtains data on presenting symptoms and their duration before consultation. Monthly electronic searches of general practitioner medical records identified recent skin consultations. Participants were sent (electronically or by mail) a Skin Questionnaire to complete regarding skin changes associated with that consultation.</p>
                <p>This was a phase 2 randomized clinical trial of a complex intervention,<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> so we collected feasibility outcomes, particularly regarding recruitment and retention. Our outcomes were additionally designed to test whether the intervention had the potential to facilitate the early detection of melanoma by evaluating its effect across a range of intermediate end points. The following outcomes were assessed at baseline and in 6-month and 12-month follow-up questionnaires: (1) skin self-examination benefits and barriers, a 10-item scale, validated in the United States among melanoma survivors<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>; (2) self-efficacy for consulting without delay, an 8-item scale adapted from a 10-item scale<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>; (3) perceived melanoma risk, 2 items<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>; and (4) sun protection habits scale, a 5-item measure validated in a US skin cancer prevention program<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> with additional questions about sun protection. We also assessed potential harms from the intervention in the 6-month and 12-month follow-up questionnaires, as follows: (1) the Melanoma Worry Scale, a 4-item scale with a range of 4 to 17, with higher scores suggesting increased anxiety<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>; (2) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, a widely used 14-item scale<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>; and (3) quality of life, using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey scale.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Participant-completed measures were collected at baseline, 1 month, and 12 months. Health service utilization data were collected at 12 months by general practice medical record audit.</p>

              <p>The primary outcome of rate of family practice skin consultation in the year following the intervention was determined for 222 of 238 participants (93.3%). Analysis of consultation rate included all patients and assumed that the 16 participants (6.7%) who were lost to follow-up during the trial had no skin consultations after they were lost to follow-up. The patient interval was determined for 19 of 51 participants (37.3%) who had skin consultations; 8 of 25 (32.0%) in the intervention group and 11 of 26 (42.3%) in the control group completed a Skin Questionnaire after a relevant family practice consultation. Secondary outcomes were available for 157 participants (66.0%) for at least 1 point.</p>

There were no statistically significant differences between trial groups on any of the secondary outcome measures (eg, measures of SSM: adjusted mean difference, 0.08; 95% CI, −0.83 to 1.00; <italic>P</italic> = .86; Melanoma Worry Scale: adjusted mean difference, −0.12; 95% CI, −0.56 to 0.31; <italic>P</italic> = .58). A sensitivity analysis additionally adjusting for age and sex showed similar results.</p>

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>To our knowledge, this is among the first trials worldwide to investigate the potential effect of a behavioral intervention using an SSM application to promote help-seeking in patients with increased risk of melanoma. We combined evidence-based approaches to identify people at increased risk in the family practice setting with new approaches using smartphone applications for SSM. We were unable to demonstrate any effect on consultation rates or patient interval, but importantly, there was no evidence of psychological harm from the intervention during the following 12 months. At the same time, there was also no evidence of any beneficial effect on sun protection habits, skin self-examination behavior, or perceived risk of developing melanoma among those receiving the intervention. Trial recruitment, retention, and initial delivery of the intervention were all feasible. However, we have no data on the actual use of the SSM app; this process measure is an important further dimension to assess before making a feasibility decision regarding a larger trial powered to demonstrate effects on either consultation rates or the primary care interval.</p>
                <p>The intervention, including uploading the app, demonstrating use of the app, and providing regular reminders, was not found to alter consultation rates or help-seeking for skin symptoms. This may have been because of the short follow-up time and possibly influenced by seasonal variation in detecting skin changes.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> We also found no differences in our quantitative measurements of sun protection habits, skin self-examination, self-efficacy to consult, melanoma risk perception, or measures of general or cancer-specific anxiety.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to interpret these findings in the context of other similar studies given that we have not been able to identify any trial evidence using a smartphone application to support SSM or SSE for individuals with increased melanoma risk. There is US trial evidence for the efficacy of SSE skills training and reminders among patients recently diagnosed with melanoma<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and among skin clinic patients without melanoma.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Furthermore, the Check It Out randomized clinical trial, set in the United States among a similar population with increased risk of melanoma, reported that increasing SSE practices in the short-term resulted in more abnormal lesions detected and more skin surgical procedures,<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> although, like our trial, it was not powered to detect melanoma diagnosis. In the United States, most studies have been set among people previously treated for a melanoma and, therefore, with very high risk for development of a new primary melanoma as well as recurrence. These studies have not demonstrated strong evidence that SSE influences melanoma mortality,<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> although it has been shown to reduce the incidence of thick melanomas.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Other studies set in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have shown that SSE practice is frequently suboptimal,<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200001r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and barriers to initiating and maintaining SSE include lack of initial training, declining motivation, and insufficient time.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p>
                <p>These barriers could be addressed by several of the features of smartphone applications that enable self-monitoring among individuals with increased risk of melanoma. Our findings relate to the concept of using an SSM application rather than the properties of the specific application selected following extensive evaluation of more than 40 available applications in 2016.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The Achieving Self-directed Integrated Cancer Aftercare intervention is a rigorously developed, theoretically based, digitally supported application that uses specified behavior-change techniques to prompt users to perform regular, high-quality SSE and gives appropriate clinical responses when they raise a concern<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>; it is currently under evaluation in a UK randomized clinical trial among individuals recently treated for primary melanoma.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Both the Achieving Self-directed Integrated Cancer Aftercare trial and our trial depend on patients using the applications optimally. We have no knowledge of how much the application was used in this trial, although no participants in either trial group reported that they had contaminated the trial by downloading other SSM smartphone applications.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. The study was designed as a phase 2 trial of a complex intervention.<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> We based the coprimary outcomes of family practice skin consultation rates and the patient interval on the intervention logic model. Encouraging people with increased risk of melanoma to self-monitor their own skin and consult their general practitioner if they have any concerns could reduce potential diagnostic delay for melanoma and could result in the detection of earlier-stage disease. Therefore, the coprimary outcomes were the most suitable intermediate measures along this causal pathway. Nevertheless, no participants were diagnosed with melanoma, and few consulted with their general practitioners during the 12-month follow-up period despite the participant population having increased risk of melanoma. This trial was not designed to have sufficient statistical power to detect a meaningful difference; a much larger trial would be needed for sufficient power to detect differences in the patient interval or skin consultation rates and an even larger trial to detect differences in time to diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, or mortality from melanoma.</p>
                <p>Although the feasibility outcomes around recruitment were satisfactory, older individuals were less likely to consent to participate. More than half of those found to be eligible for the trial consented to participate. The randomized groups were well-balanced, and few participants were lost to follow-up over 12 months (16 [6.7%]). However, there were fewer than expected events across both groups (ie, 51 skin consultations) and a low response (ie, 37%) to the Skin Questionnaire, meaning that we were unable to report on the effect of the intervention on the time to consultation (ie, patient interval). The control group received a brief discussion about skin health and Cancer Research UK leaflets. While intended as an attention control, this could potentially have increased consultations about skin changes and reduced the effect size of the intervention. We were unable to accurately assess the use of the application by participants (either by direct or electronic questioning) and cannot say whether it was used regularly for skin self-monitoring or whether that contributed to the absence of effect on consultation rates in the intervention arm. We consider the findings generalizable beyond the East of England because of the recruitment of patients from 12 general practices located in urban and rural areas with a range of size of patient lists and socioeconomic deprivation.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this phase 2 randomized trial, the use of a SSM smartphone application did not have an effect on the rate at which participants with higher risk of melanoma consulted with family practice physicians regarding skin changes. Therefore, significant uncertainty remains regarding the best strategies to promote early detection of melanoma. For those with moderate risk of melanoma, behavioral approaches, such as using an SSM smartphone application to prompt timely consultation, remain an option, promoted particularly among policy makers, but our trial does not offer even preliminary randomized clinical trial evidence to support this. While such applications have not been shown to have value in diagnosing melanoma,<sup><xref rid="zoi200001r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> they may have more promise as monitoring tools to identify skin changes. Further evidence on how to ensure people with increased risk of melanoma engage with and use these applications and whether this leads to earlier detection is needed. Until then, the role of smartphone applications as a strategy to detect melanoma earlier remains unclear.</p>
