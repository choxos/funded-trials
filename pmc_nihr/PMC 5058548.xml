                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has an essential role in the expansion and function of CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs reduce tissue damage by limiting the immune response following infection and regulate autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells (Teffs) to prevent autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Genetic susceptibility to T1D causes alterations in the IL-2 pathway, a finding that supports Tregs as a cellular therapeutic target. Aldesleukin (Proleukin; recombinant human IL-2), which is administered at high doses to activate the immune system in cancer immunotherapy, is now being repositioned to treat inflammatory and autoimmune disorders at lower doses by targeting Tregs.</p>

                  <title>Methods and Findings</title>
                  <p>To define the aldesleukin dose response for Tregs and to find doses that increase Tregs physiologically for treatment of T1D, a statistical and systematic approach was taken by analysing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of subcutaneous aldesleukin in the Adaptive Study of IL-2 Dose on Regulatory T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes (DILT1D), a single centre, non-randomised, open label, adaptive dose-finding trial with 40 adult participants with recently diagnosed T1D. The primary endpoint was the maximum percentage increase in Tregs (defined as CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>) from the baseline frequency in each participant measured over the 7 d following treatment. There was an initial learning phase with five pairs of participants, each pair receiving one of five pre-assigned single doses from 0.04 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>, in order to model the dose-response curve. Results from each participant were then incorporated into interim statistical modelling to target the two doses most likely to induce 10% and 20% increases in Treg frequencies. Primary analysis of the evaluable population (<italic>n</italic> = 39) found that the optimal doses of aldesleukin to induce 10% and 20% increases in Tregs were 0.101 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> (standard error [SE] = 0.078, 95% CI = −0.052, 0.254) and 0.497 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> (SE = 0.092, 95% CI = 0.316, 0.678), respectively. On analysis of secondary outcomes, using a highly sensitive IL-2 assay, the observed plasma concentrations of the drug at 90 min exceeded the hypothetical Treg-specific therapeutic window determined in vitro (0.015–0.24 IU/ml), even at the lowest doses (0.040 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 0.045 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>) administered. A rapid decrease in Treg frequency in the circulation was observed at 90 min and at day 1, which was dose dependent (mean decrease 11.6%, SE = 2.3%, range 10.0%–48.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 37), rebounding at day 2 and increasing to frequencies above baseline over 7 d. Teffs, natural killer cells, and eosinophils also responded, with their frequencies rapidly and dose-dependently decreased in the blood, then returning to, or exceeding, pretreatment levels. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent down modulation of one of the two signalling subunits of the IL-2 receptor, the β chain (CD122) (mean decrease = 58.0%, SE = 2.8%, range 9.8%–85.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 33), on Tregs and a reduction in their sensitivity to aldesleukin at 90 min and day 1 and 2 post-treatment. Due to blood volume requirements as well as ethical and practical considerations, the study was limited to adults and to analysis of peripheral blood only.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The DILT1D trial results, most notably the early altered trafficking and desensitisation of Tregs induced by a single ultra-low dose of aldesleukin that resolves within 2–3 d, inform the design of the next trial to determine a repeat dosing regimen aimed at establishing a steady-state Treg frequency increase of 20%–50%, with the eventual goal of preventing T1D.</p>

                      <p>Aldesleukin, recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2), was selected as a candidate immunotherapy to prevent or delay autoimmunity because previous genetic and phenotypic analyses indicate a major role for the IL-2 pathway in the development of T1D.</p>

                      <p>IL-2 is critical for maintaining the function of the regulatory T cells (Tregs) that prevent autoimmunity. Therefore, the first step in our approach to T1D prevention was to determine the single doses of aldesleukin that increase Treg numbers within the physiological range, aiming to mimic the protection against T1D afforded by the risk-reducing alleles of the IL-2 pathway.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the second most common chronic disease of children, and yet insulin replacement is the only therapy currently approved to treat the disease. Insulin replacement corrects insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia but does not treat the underlying autoimmune T lymphocyte–mediated destruction of the insulin-producing β cells of the pancreatic islets [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The result is a lifelong requirement for intensive insulin treatment that increases the risk of hypoglycaemia and stops the majority of patients from achieving adequate metabolic control to prevent the long-term complications of retinopathy, neuropathy, and/or nephropathy [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Given these clinical outcomes, there have been intensive efforts over the last four decades to develop immunotherapies that suppress β cell autoimmunity in order to preserve endogenous insulin production, using standard trial methodologies [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While these approaches have achieved some success, an alternative strategy to identify potential immunotherapies is to use pathophysiological insights from human genetic associations to identify modifiable pathways [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>The interest in modulation of the IL-2 pathway as a potential T1D therapy was initiated by mapping of a major susceptibility locus in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model to the IL-2 gene [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The mechanism for T1D susceptibility in NOD mice was identified as a reduction of regulatory T cell (Treg) function through reduced IL-2 production by the NOD susceptibility allele [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In humans, allelic variation of the IL-2 receptor gene, <italic>IL2RA</italic>, encoding the α subunit (CD25) was identified as a susceptibility determinant for T1D [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Genome-wide association studies identified a number of other T1D susceptibility genes in the IL-2 pathway, encoding critical proteins mediating immune activation and regulation (IL-2, IL-21, BACH2, PTPN2, IL-10) [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Analysis of the effect of the common susceptibility allele of the major causal variant in the <italic>IL2RA</italic> region showed that it decreased expression of CD25 on the surface of CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells (Teffs) and Tregs [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the <italic>IL2</italic>-<italic>IL21</italic> T1D susceptibility region has been found to be associated with decreased numbers of IL-10 producing islet-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Teffs [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, deficiencies in the IL-2 pathway and in genes expressed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including Tregs, could contribute to disruption of the homeostatic equilibrium between IL-2-dependent Tregs and Teffs, which produce IL-2 to sustain the Tregs and enable them to regulate Teff activity during infections and maintain self-tolerance in health [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>High-dose aldesleukin (Proleukin; recombinant human IL-2) is currently licensed for the treatment of adults with metastatic renal cell cancer and metastatic melanoma, administered intravenously at 600,000 IU/kg every 8 h for 5 d followed by 9 d of rest and a further two treatment cycles, if clinically tolerated [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Aldesleukin at these doses induces the activation and proliferation of Teffs and natural killer (NK) cells to destroy tumour cells. However, it was found that high-dose aldesleukin also expands the Treg pool such that patients with melanoma with enhanced expansion of Tregs had a worse outcome compared to those with fewer Tregs [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These observations, combined with the results of several preclinical murine studies in which aldesleukin selectively increased Tregs and prevented or reversed autoimmune diabetes, have focused efforts on the development of low-dose aldesleukin protocols to treat T1D and other immune disorders [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>Most recently, proof of concept of the clinical benefit of low-dose aldesleukin has been reported for chronic graft versus host disease [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], hepatitis-C-virus-induced vasculitis [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and alopecia areata [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In T1D, a small safety study was conducted in which relatively high doses of aldesleukin (4.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU, three times per week for 1 mo) were combined with rapamycin, resulting in a transient loss of endogenous insulin production (as measured by C-peptide) in participants that was reversed on withdrawal of the therapy [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This has led to discontinuation of this combination [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast, using lower doses of aldesleukin alone (range 0.33 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 3.00 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU) administered daily for 5 d induced an increase in Tregs without impairment of pancreatic β cell function [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The treatment regimen developed from this dose-finding study has now been carried forward into the DIABIL-2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of ultra-low doses of recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) in children and adults with T1D [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>These studies and trials share an initial induction phase of daily or every other day rhIL-2 administration or long-term daily dosing modelled on cancer therapy and a standard approach to drug development. In contrast, our goal is to establish a regular dosing regimen that could be given to children and adults shortly after diagnosis of T1D over a long period of time that maintains residual β cell function by protecting β cells from autoimmune Teffs through improving Treg function within physiological ranges. The underlying rationale is that we aim to mimic the protection from disease afforded by the risk-reducing alleles of the IL-2 pathway genes by establishing in experimental medicine studies a long-term dosing regimen that induces and maintains a stable, steady-state increase in Tregs within the normal physiological range, but that does not compromise immune defence against pathogens, responses to vaccines, or cancer immunosurveillance. This approach might avoid the potential complications and risks associated with prolonged administration of immunosuppressive treatments that preclude their use in the T1D prevention setting [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. More intensive aldesleukin treatment regimens may be required for autoinflammatory disorders in which the tissue damage caused by the ongoing immune response causes pathology that may be life-threatening without immunosuppression, such as in systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic graft versus host disease. In contrast, the immune systems of patients diagnosed with T1D are relatively immunocompetent, with only small differences in lymphocyte phenotypes between cases and controls [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
              <p>The first step in optimising the delivery of aldesleukin in T1D is to understand the kinetics of the biological effects of a single dose in adults with T1D. Here, in the Adaptive Study of IL-2 Dose on Regulatory T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes (DILT1D), the effects of single-dose aldesleukin were investigated by observing multiple biomarkers before treatment (baseline), at 90 min after drug administration, daily for 4 d, and then intermittently for 9 wk. The study used an adaptive design to initially estimate the Treg dose response to aldesleukin and then to identify the two doses of aldesleukin that increase Tregs minimally (10% relative to pretreatment) or maximally (20%) while remaining within the normal Treg frequency range.</p>

                <title>Adaptive Study Design</title>
                <p>The DILT1D trial was a 9-wk, single centre, non-randomised, open label, adaptive dose-finding trial that was conducted at the National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom. The study included 12 visits: after a screening visit, the aldesleukin dose was administered on day 0, and the participants were followed up, including blood sampling, 90 min after administration and subsequently on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 14, and 21, with a final follow-up visit on day 60. According to protocol amendments, visits between the seventh and 21st days were given 48 h of flexibility, and a safety visit on day 5 was removed. During protocol development, statistical simulations suggested that a sample size of 40 would give an informative estimate of the dose and target responses. The trial consisted of two phases: a learning phase (with ten individuals) and an adaptive phase (with 30 individuals). In the learning phase, participants received 0.04 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.16 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.60 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 1.00 × 10<sup>6</sup>, and 1.50 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> of aldesleukin in ascending order, with each dose administered to two participants before escalation. Once the tenth participant had completed 7 d of follow-up, the clinical Treg and safety data were extracted from the trial database, and a preplanned interim analysis was carried out by the clinical trial statisticians by fitting a candidate set of parametric models to estimate the dose-response curve. A statistical analysis report was generated and delivered to the Dose Determining Committee (DDC)—consisting of a physician (S. Neupane, M. Evans, or F. Waldron-Lynch), a statistician (M. Evangelou, S. Bond, or A. P. Mander), and a scientist (J. A. Todd or L. S. Wicker)—within seven working days in order to select the doses to achieve the targeted Treg increases from baseline of 10% (minimal Treg increase) and 20% (maximal). In the adaptive phase, as soon as a participant had completed the day 7 visit, the accumulated data of the primary endpoint were analysed by the statisticians of the study. The DDC then reviewed the interim analyses and accumulated safety data before allocating the next recommended dose to the next participant of the adaptive phase. For each model, a set of doses to assign to the next patient cohort was identified that maximised the predicted reduction in the area of the 95% confidence region around the two estimated target doses (i.e., minimising the determinant of the covariance matrix) at the following interim analysis. The DDC resolved the infrequent cases where the models recommended different sets of doses to assign. The DILT1D protocol and novel governance structures that were developed to make regular dose decisions by committee were published prior to completion of the study and final analysis of the endpoints [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>

                <p>All clinical flow cytometry (FACS) was performed following good clinical practice at the Department of Clinical Immunology, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK, within 4 h of phlebotomy. Operators were blinded to the aldesleukin dose allocated. A 2.6-ml sample of peripheral whole blood was collected into EDTA tubes, and 50 μl was stained with specific fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies at room temperature for 15 min to identify Tregs as CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup> T cells. The clones used were anti-CD3 (clone SK7, phycoerythrin [PE]-Cy7-labelled; BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 (clone RPA-T4, FITC-labelled; BD Biosciences), anti-CD127 (clone HIL-7R-M21, PE-labelled; BD Biosciences), anti-CD25 (clone M-A251 and 2A3, allophycocyanin [APC]-labelled; BD Biosciences), anti-CD45RA (clone HI100, APC-Cy7-labelled; BioLegend), and anti-CD62L (clone DREG-56, PerCP/Cy5.5-labelled; BioLegend). Red cells were then lysed (BD FACS Lysing Solution); the cells were washed and resuspended in BD Cell Fix and then immediately analysed on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer utilising FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). In parallel, a whole-blood BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK assay using BD Trucount Tubes according to the manufacturers’ instructions (BD Biosciences) was run to determine the relative and absolute concentration of lymphocyte subpopulations, including T, B, and NK cells.</p>

For surface staining, 150 μl of whole blood was incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies at room temperature for 45 min. Red cells were then lysed (BD FACS Lysing Solution), washed, and then analysed on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer. For intracellular staining, cells were treated with Intracellular Fixation &amp; Permeabilization Buffer Set (eBioscience) after labelling with surface antibodies, washed twice with Permeabilization Buffer, and then incubated with an intracellular antibody panel (shown in grey in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s031">S1 Table</xref>) at 4°C for 45 min. Samples were analysed on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo (Tree Star). Where possible, subset frequencies such as percent Tregs were expressed as an average obtained from the analysis of tubes 1–6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s031">S1 Table</xref>). To measure the effects in vitro of aldesleukin on CD25 and CD122 expression on lymphocyte subsets, heparinized venous blood (25 ml) from healthy volunteers was divided into ten 2-ml aliquots. Aliquots of whole blood were cultured with either 50 units/ml aldesleukin or medium alone (equivalent volume PBS + 2% BSA) at time points 0, 15, 30, 90, and 180 min. Samples were incubated at 37°C while being rotated at 35 degrees above horizontal. All samples were processed at 180 min for surface staining as per the described standard operating procedure, except that following addition of the antibody panel, samples were quenched on ice for 2 min and incubated at 4°C to prevent ongoing stimulation.

                <p>Suppression assays were performed in selected participants with Treg responses in V-bottom 96-well plates using cryopreserved PBMCs by coculturing 500 sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>low-medium</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>−</sup> memory Teffs (mTeffs) in the presence or absence of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup> Tregs at various ratios (Treg:Teff 0:1 to 1:8) with 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup> B cells. Samples were stimulated with PHA (4 μg/ml; Alere) and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for 6 d. Proliferation was assessed by the addition of 0.5 μCi/well [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine (PerkinElmer) for the final 20 h of coculture. All conditions were run in 12 replicates, and proliferation readings (counts per minute [CPM]) averaged. Any samples with averaged proliferation less than 1,000 CPM from the mTeff wells alone were excluded. The percentage suppression in each culture was calculated using the following formula: percent suppression = 100 − [(CPM in the presence of Tregs ÷ CPM in the absence of Tregs) × 100].</p>

                <p>Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured using a custom V-PLEX Human CRP Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Meso Scale Diagnostics [MSD]) and read on the MSD Sector Imager 6000. Plasma IL-2 was measured using the MSD S-PLEX Human IL-2 Assay [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] (limit of quantitation 2 fg/ml) at MSD. In order to convert the plasma IL-2 (fg/ml) levels provided by MSD to plasma aldesleukin (IU/ml) levels, readings from the MSD S-PLEX Human IL-2 Assay at 90 min after aldesleukin administration for all DILT1D participants were compared to results from an in-house human IL-2 DELFIA-based immunoassay [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] that has a limit of quantitation of 10 pg/ml using aldesleukin (specific activity 16.4 IU/ng) as the standard curve. A linear relationship was observed between the two assays; a conversion of 3.4-fold was required to convert MSD S-PLEX Human IL-2 Assay readings to those obtained using an aldesleukin standard curve. This conversion factor was applied to all other samples tested at MSD, all of which had been below the limit of detection or quantification in the in-house assay. Plasma-soluble CD25 was measured in duplicate using an in-house sandwich immunoassay as described in [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Primary endpoint analysis—interim analyses</title>
                  <p>The primary endpoint analysis was carried out at all conducted interim analyses of the trial as well as at the end of the trial using all accumulated data of the evaluable population. The aim of the primary analysis was to find the best model that describes the dose-response curve, and to identify the doses that achieve the minimum Treg increase (10%) and the maximum Treg increase (20%) targets selected by the DDC of the trial. The relationship of the primary endpoint with dose was explored by fitting a number of candidate models. The candidate models include the linear, the quadratic, the cubic, the logistic, and the Emax (with three and four parameters). The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the deviance of each model were computed as measures of adequacy of fit. The proposed target doses of each model, with their standard errors and with a 95% confidence interval, were also computed. The primary endpoint analysis at the end of the trial was conducted on both the evaluable and the analysis populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s001">S1 Analysis</xref>).</p>

                  <p>For each time point and for each response/phenotype, two measures were defined: the absolute change and the percentage change. The absolute change is defined as the difference between the time point measurement and the baseline (pretreatment) measurement. The percentage change is defined as the ratio of the aforementioned absolute change to the baseline measurement. Based both on the absolute and on the percentage change, a number of derived variables were defined, including the 90-min measurement (where available), the day 1 measurement, and the maximum observed value from day 1 (or from 90 min where available) to day 7 times 100. One of the key hypotheses of interest is whether the absolute (or percentage) change at a particular time point of interest is zero. This hypothesis was tested using a <italic>t</italic>-test statistic. Equivalently, paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare two responses at a time point of interest, as reported in the results. The effect of dose on the derived variables computed using the percentage change was explored by fitting both a linear model and a cubic model. The model with the smallest AIC was chosen as the most representative model for fitting the data. A <italic>p</italic>-value of association of dose with the response was computed by comparing through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) the two aforementioned models with the model represented only by the intercept term. For cases where the linear model was the best fit, we report both the dose coefficient and the dose <italic>p</italic>-value; for cases where the cubic model was the best fit, we report only the dose <italic>p</italic>-value. The effect of dose on the derived variables computed using the absolute change was explored by comparing a series of models that included the effect of the baseline measurement of each tested response. The model with the smallest AIC was chosen as the best model. For the cases where the interaction and additive models were the best ones, they were compared with the baseline model for finding the effect of dose. A dose <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated through ANOVA. Similarly, for the models where the dose model was the best, a dose <italic>p</italic>-value was computed by comparing the dose model with the null model through ANOVA. For Treg CD25 MFI, pSTAT5 (normalised memory Treg) MFI, and FOXP3 MFI (CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> out of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) responses, we were interested in understanding how their measurements changed per day. Using the percentage change at all time points between 90 min and day 60 (or day 3 for pSTAT5), the relationship with dose was modeled either through a linear model or through a cubic model, both with no intercept term included. For each response, the model with the smallest AIC was chosen across the tested days. The best model was used for predicting the response and a 95% confidence interval around it for each time point for the two chosen doses derived from the primary endpoint analysis.</p>

                  <title>Average response plots and summary statistics</title>
                  <p>The range of doses administered was divided into five dose groups. These five groups are 0.040–0.045 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.160–0.380 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.385–0.610 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.620–0.990 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 1.00–1.50 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>, with 12, 8, 9, 7, and 4 participants in the analysis population, respectively. For each time point of either the absolute change or the percentage change, we averaged the time measurements of the participants within each dose group. This averaging was performed from the day 1 measurements (or from 90 min if applicable) to the day 7 measurements. For the participants whose visit on day 7 was truncated to an alternative day (±48 h, according to protocol amendment), their day 7 measurement was linearly interpolated using the closest measurements to day 7, which was subsequently used in the averaged response graphs. Throughout the manuscript the following statistics are reported for each phenotype: mean (standard error [SE], range) and the number of individuals (<italic>n</italic>).</p>

                <p>DILT1D was an adaptive dose-finding study to increase Tregs as a proportion of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the physiological range, with a sample size of 40. In total, 45 participants were enrolled in the study between 22 March 2013 and 15 May 2014, with the first participant recruited on 8 April 2013. Five participants were ineligible for the study due to the absence of a single T1D-associated antibody. Forty participants were treated with a single dose of aldesleukin (Proleukin, Novartis); one participant withdrew due to the development of a norovirus infection. Thirty-nine participants are included in the evaluable population, while 40 are included in the safety and analysis populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The demographic characteristics and autoantibody status at screening of the safety and analysis populations are shown in <xref rid="pmed.1002139.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Participants were recruited from the European Union to the study site at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, with 38 from the United Kingdom, 1 from Ireland, and 1 from France [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Most participants had been recently diagnosed with T1D (<italic>n</italic> = 36; duration 3–24 mo), with four newly diagnosed (&lt; 3 mo). The DILT1D study team employed a response adaptive design, with a learning phase to find the shape of the dose-response curve and an adaptive phase to find the two aldesleukin doses that increase the target Treg frequency by 10% and 20% in the best statistical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>).</p>

(B) The study was conducted in two phases, a learning phase (140 d) and an adaptive phase (240 d). Individual participants are represented by a horizontal line, the length corresponding to the time from treatment until their final visit. In the learning phase, the first ten participants received a 0.04 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.16 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.60 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 1.00 × 10<sup>6</sup>, or 1.50 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> dose of aldesleukin (colour represents dose allocated) in ascending order, with each dose being administered to two participants before escalation. In the adaptive phase, the DDC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s030">S3 Materials</xref>) met on 19 occasions to review the interim safety data and allocate doses based on the analysis of the accumulated Treg data (shaded area) from all treated participants at that time. (C) Schematic of the study design illustrating that each participant who passed screening was administered a single dose of aldesleukin and followed for 60 d. During the adaptive phase, Treg data for every participant up to day 7 was included in an interim analysis and then further doses were allocated to the next participants.

Tregs showed a dose response to a single administration of aldesleukin, with higher doses leading to larger increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This relationship was analysed in several candidate models, with the cubic model being found to be the best one to describe the dose-response curve as it had the smallest deviance and visually fitted the data the best (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s002">S2 Analysis</xref>). Analysis of the evaluable population for the primary endpoint found that the optimal doses of aldesleukin to induce 10% and 20% increases in Tregs were 0.101 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> (SE = 0.078, 95% CI = −0.052, 0.254) and 0.497 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> (SE = 0.092, 95% CI = 0.316, 0.678), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

                <p>A single participant had a severe AE that consisted of a transient self-limiting gastrointestinal event commencing 30 h after administration of a dose of aldesleukin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s015">S2 Fig</xref>). Prior to administration of aldesleukin, clinical history, examination, and laboratory investigations were normal, apart from a low neutrophil count (2.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l [normal range: 4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l to 11 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l]). The clinical presentation and course were consistent with a norovirus infection. To confirm the clinical diagnosis and identify the pathogen, we carried out serology testing for antibodies to norovirus and detected the induction of GII.4 IgG antibody titres at day 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s015">S2 Fig</xref>), peaking at day 21 post-infection and declining thereafter, confirming that the participant had been infected with norovirus.</p>
                <p>Most participants had an expected AE at the injection site consisting a non-itchy, local (1–5 cm), non-painful erythematous rash on day 1 followed by a subcutaneous nodule on day 2 that resolved on average by day 10 (SE = 2, range 1–58 d; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s016">S3 Fig</xref>).

The greatest decrease in lymphocytes was observed in participants who received the highest doses (1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 4), with one participant developing a transient asymptomatic lymphopenia (count &lt; 1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l) that resolved by day 2. The white blood cell and neutrophil count decreased on average by approximately 10% on day 1, without a dose response, while the monocyte and basophil counts were unchanged by aldesleukin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s035">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

                  <p>There was an asymptomatic decrease in eosinophils of approximately 15% at 90 min, followed by an increase on day 1 that resolved by day 3–4, with six participants developing a transient eosinophilia (count &gt; 0.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s035">S5 Table</xref>). Given the increase and development of eosinophilia, we analysed the eosinophil counts further to explore if the change was related to both dose and baseline eosinophil count.

                  <p>Measurement of Tregs in whole blood samples after 90 min revealed that the reduction was rapid and sustained, with Treg percentage remaining below baseline on day 1 at all doses greater than the lowest dose range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). At 90 min the decline in Tregs was not dose dependent, but by day 1, the reduction in Tregs was dose dependent, with higher doses of aldesleukin leading to greater declines in Tregs (<italic>n</italic> = 37, dose <italic>p</italic> = 1.32 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Using a recently developed IL-2 assay that is 5,000-fold more sensitive than conventional assays, we established that baseline levels of IL-2 in the DILT1D participants were 12.17–64.07 fg/ml (0.0007–0.0036 IU/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), similar to those reported for healthy individuals [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. At 90 min following subcutaneous dosing, which is near the time of peak blood concentration of aldesleukin using this route of administration [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], IL-2 plasma levels ranged from 0.35 to 27.46 IU/ml depending on the dose delivered and averaged 5.73 IU/ml (SE = 1.07, <italic>n</italic> = 37) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). There was a linear relationship between the dose of aldesleukin administered and the plasma concentration of IL-2 at day 1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). All aldesleukin doses produced IL-2 blood levels at 90 min sufficient to increase pSTAT5 in a portion of Teffs and NK CD56<sup>bright</sup> (CD56<sup>high</sup>TCR<sup>α/β−</sup>) cells in addition to a majority of the Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g005">Fig 5G</xref>); this finding was confirmed by assessing pSTAT5 levels in various cell types ex vivo at 90 min following aldesleukin dosing. Aldesleukin plasma levels remained above the 0.015 IU/ml concentration required to cause signalling in naïve Tregs (nTregs) and memory Tregs (mTregs) for up to 4 d, and above the 0.24 IU/ml concentration required for mTeff and NK CD56<sup>bright</sup> cell activation for up to 1 d, depending on dose. Thus, although Tregs have an approximately 10-fold higher affinity for aldesleukin than do Teffs and NK CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells, a completely Treg-specific aldesleukin plasma level was not achieved, even at the lowest doses administered.</p>

                  <title>Change in Treg phenotype</title>
                  <p>In order to determine if there was a change in Treg phenotype in blood after treatment, we analysed expression of CD25 and CD122 on Tregs before and after treatment. At baseline, mTregs have approximately on average a 55% higher expression of CD25 and a 90% higher expression of CD122 than nTregs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s019">S6 Fig</xref>). Because of this heterogeneity between Treg subsets, mTregs and nTregs were assessed separately as well as together as total Tregs. At higher aldesleukin doses there were initial small decreases of CD25 expression on mTregs at 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), followed by a large dose-dependent increase on day 1 in response to treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 37, dose coefficient = 35.24, dose <italic>p</italic> = 6.68 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The increase in CD25 in total Tregs was maximal on day 1.59 (SE = 0.13, range 1–4 d, <italic>n</italic> = 37) and was dose dependent (<italic>n</italic> = 37, dose coefficient = 35.40, <italic>p</italic> = 3.02 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s020">S7 Fig</xref>).

In contrast to changes observed for Treg CD25 expression, CD122 levels on the mTregs remaining in the blood were substantially lower at 90 min post-dosing.

Whole blood samples at baseline and 90 min post-dosing were compared for their ability to respond to aldesleukin at a concentration that saturates the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (1,000 IU/ml). We found that the mTregs at 90 min responded to the high concentration of aldesleukin in vitro with lower pSTAT5 levels compared to mTregs at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 36, <italic>p</italic> = 1.28 × 10<sup>−9</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). In order to replicate and extend our findings, pSTAT5 was measured in Treg subsets from cryopreserved PBMCs isolated at baseline and day 1 that were incubated with 0.4 IU/ml aldesleukin to provide a submaximal stimulation. In the mTreg subset we observed that dosing with aldesleukin resulted in a transient dose-dependent decrease in the percentage of mTregs that became pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> on day 1 post-dosing (<italic>n</italic> = 21, dose <italic>p</italic> = 9.60 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g006">Fig 6F</xref>).

The findings on day 1 were consistent with an independent analysis of cryopreserved PBMCs from day 3 post-dosing, when the Treg count in the blood is greatest. The circulating mTregs and nTregs are more responsive to aldesleukin with higher CD25 (<italic>n</italic> = 15, <italic>p</italic> = 3.76 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, and <italic>n</italic> = 15, <italic>p</italic> = 2.83 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s022">S9 Fig</xref>) and FOXP3 (<italic>n</italic> = 15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, and <italic>n</italic> = 15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002139.s022">S9 Fig</xref>) expression than at baseline. The overall effect of a dose of aldesleukin on Tregs by day 3 was to have increased the number of fully suppressive, demethylated FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, which we presume have trafficked through tissues and been activated by self-antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g007">Fig 7H, 7I and 7K</xref>).</p>
                  <p>The data generated in the study was used to develop a predictive model for each of these Treg responses and applied it to investigate the effects of the optimal doses of aldesleukin to induce 10% and 20% increases in Tregs, 0.101 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.497 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. At 0.101 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>, Treg pSTAT5 peaks at 90 min and then returns to baseline by day 2, while CD25 MFI and Treg frequencies are increased for 3 d. The 0.497 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> dose had a more sustained predicted response, showing elevated Treg pSTAT5 for up to 3 d and total Treg frequencies not quite at baseline at 7 d, with an increase in CD25 expression for up to 7 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002139.g007">Fig 7J</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our aim is to develop an immunomodulatory therapy for T1D that increases immune regulation within physiological levels to inhibit autoreactive T cells while preserving immune responses to pathogens and cancer immunosurveillance. Such a therapy could be tested initially in newly diagnosed patients, many of whom retain sufficient insulin production to prevent diabetic complications [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and, if successful, lead to the treatment of autoimmunity to prevent the metabolic diagnosis of T1D. Critical to this strategy is to first characterise the Treg dose response, the duration, and the effects of a single ultra-low dose of aldesleukin on the human immune system. In DILT1D we have determined the Treg dose response to a single dose of subcutaneous aldesleukin and defined two doses required to increase Treg frequencies by predefined amounts, in a formal clinical governance framework, with an adaptive statistical design.</p>
              <p>The single dose of aldesleukin was well tolerated other than a small self-limiting injection site reaction, a common adverse event observed in almost every treated participant except in one, in whom there was no increase in plasma aldesleukin at 90 min following administration of an extremely low volume dose (0.02 ml). The influenza-like syndrome (malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, shivering, or fever) that has been observed in participants administered 5-d or daily dosing regimens was not recorded in DILT1D [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], although there were two episodes of rhinitis that were possibly related to drug administration. A norovirus infection developed following treatment in a single participant who, retrospectively, was found to have been subclinically infected before treatment and who fully recovered, mounting a robust immune response to the virus. The early time point and intensive daily monitoring in DILT1D enabled us to establish that lymphocyte counts have a transient dose-dependent decline on day 1 without the development of the persistent lymphopenia that is characteristic of the high-dose aldesleukin oncology protocols [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Persistent lymphopenia would not be a favourable feature of a repeat dosing regimen, but in DILT1D we observed that the decrease in lymphocytes was dose dependent, and a transient asymptomatic lymphopenia (count &lt; 1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l) was observed in only a single participant treated with the highest dose administered (1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>). The two doses that DILT1D identified as increasing Tregs by 10% and 20% are ultra-low and have a low risk of lymphopenia. In contrast, eosinophils increased on day 1 after treatment, and analysis of eosinophil counts determined that the pretreatment count influenced the eosinophil response to aldesleukin, with high baseline counts leading to a transient eosinophilia post-treatment. This finding suggests that in future trials, participants with lower eosinophil counts could be stratified to aldesleukin treatment to avoid eosinophilia.</p>
              <p>DILT1D was a mechanistic trial designed to determine immune outcomes of treatment and not to assess clinical efficacy [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Participants had no evidence of the development of a decline in C-peptide as has been observed with frequent administration of repeat IL-2 doses with rapamycin in participants with T1D [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Another feature of the trial is the use of FACS analysis of whole blood rather than cryopreserved PBMCs. Fresh whole blood facilitated rapid analysis, reduced the manipulation of the samples, and allowed the analysis of the expression of surface receptors such as the chemokine receptors that might be lost during the freezing, storage, and thawing of PBMCs. However, due to the variation in T cell numbers in the blood between participants, lower numbers of T cells were available for analysis in blood samples from some participants, making it difficult to define the response in rare subsets. The DILT1D trial was limited to adults and the analysis of peripheral blood only due to blood volume requirements and ethical and practical considerations.</p>
              <p>In achieving the two primary endpoints (10% and 20% maximum increases in Treg frequencies from baseline), the pharmacodynamics of subcutaneous aldesleukin were also analysed, revealing hyperacute decreases in the frequencies of Tregs and of other cells in the blood, with frequencies returning to, or exceeding, baseline frequencies 24 h or days later, depending on aldesleukin dose and cell type. These decreases could be due to aldesleukin enhancing retention of cells in the tissues and/or egress of cells from the circulation into the tissues.</p>
              <p>In the first hours after administration of aldesleukin there was limited Treg selectivity, with responses from Teffs and NK cells, due to high concentrations of the drug for the first few hours, consistent with the drug’s half-life in vivo of 4–5 h following subcutaneous administration [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These initial IL-2 concentrations are greater than those reported in patients with sepsis [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. When a conventional IL-2 assay was used and not the supersensitive IL-2 assay [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we observed the peak IL-2 concentrations at 90 min, but no quantifiable readings above background after this time point were measured. Use of the much more sensitive assay allowed for the measurement of sustained physiologically active concentrations of aldesleukin up to 4 d after dosing in the case of Tregs and between 1 and 2 d after dosing for mTeffs and NK CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells. Nevertheless, there is still some level of Treg selectivity, and it remains to be determined what homeostasis the immune system will reach if steady-state increases of Tregs in the order of 20%–50% are achieved by repeated aldesleukin doses, which is now being investigated in a follow-up trial, DILfrequency (NCT02265809) [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The finding at 24 h post-dosing that the higher doses of aldesleukin (&gt;0.38 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>) resulted in sufficient concentrations of IL-2 to stimulate Teffs and alter their circulation and proliferation should inform the design of dosing regimens.</p>
              <p>Another finding that impacts the design of dosing regimens came from analysis of the expression of the IL-2 receptor subunits on Tregs, NK cells, and Teffs. There was a rapid down modulation of the signal-transducing subunit, the β chain/CD122, on Tregs associated with a reduction in the sensitivity of these cells to IL-2. It is possible that in a daily dosing induction phase of IL-2 treatment, a combination of Treg desensitisation and Teff activation could increase insulitis and exacerbate T cell/cytokine-mediated destruction of β cells in T1D patients. Taken together, the results suggest a regimen with doses in the range of 0.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup>, and we envisage that a favourable interval might be greater than every 2 d, but probably not as much as 1 or 2 wk, if a steady-state Treg increase is the aim. Desensitisation could partly explain the non-responsiveness of Tregs in some patients receiving daily doses of aldesleukin of 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> IU/m<sup>2</sup> or more [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We acknowledge that regular dosing to achieve steady-state increases of Tregs of 20%–50%, if this is achievable in DILfrequency, may not prevent β cell destruction, and a phase 2 clinical trial to test efficacy will be required to answer this question.</p>
              <p>The prolonged, dose-dependent duration of Treg response to a single dose of aldesleukin was unexpected. At the higher doses of aldesleukin, mTregs remained elevated for greater than 7 d in the absence of IL-2 plasma levels above baseline, suggesting that trafficking through tissues and exposure to self-antigens helps to sustain the Treg increase. Exposure of Tregs to IL-2 in vitro is not sufficient to cause proliferation. Activation and cell division of Tregs requires antigen and T cell receptor signalling. In mouse lymph nodes removal of either T cell receptor signalling or the IL-2 supplied from Teffs leads to reduced Treg function and uncontrolled Teffs [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Finally, in addition to the effects on Tregs by aldesleukin, we observed that NK cells that express high levels of CD56 and CD122 and low levels of CD25 are highly sensitive to aldesleukin in vivo. These NK CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells could have immunoregulatory function, so their induction by aldesleukin may be a desirable phenotype in suppression of T-cell-mediated autoimmunity [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and perhaps also in the regulation of the Teff responses that were observed when plasma aldesleukin concentrations were high.</p>
              <p>Having found an aldesleukin-induced alteration in cell trafficking, we noted that a decline in T cells from the peripheral blood has also been reported in clinical trials of teplizumab (humanised non-Fc-binding antibody to anti-CD3), which has been shown to preserve C-peptide in newly diagnosed T1D participants [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This T cell response has been characterised in a humanised mouse model and was shown to require migration of CCR6<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the gut to acquire a regulatory phenotype, including increased CCR6 expression and IL-10 production by FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Endogenous IL-2 production in response to anti-CD3 treatment was reported in the original preclinical NOD mouse study [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and plasma IL-2 was increased in a portion of participants in the clinical trials of teplizumab in T1D, accompanied by an increase of CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore it seems possible that anti-CD3-induced Treg migration during treatment may be due in part to IL-2 production by anti-CD3-stimulated T cells in vivo.</p>
              <p>The DILT1D trial has characterised the effects of single ultra-low doses of aldesleukin on circulating immune cells and defined two doses that increased Tregs within the normal range. The next step in our systematic experimental medicine approach is to bring these two doses forward in a second adaptive study to determine the optimal dose and frequency of administration to reach a homeostatic increase in Tregs while minimising Teff activation [<xref rid="pmed.1002139.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We do not think this can be modelled, given the pleiotropic response to aldesleukin observed, and has to be determined using an efficient statistical design, with mechanistic analyses to characterise the effects of repeated doses of aldesleukin on the immune system.</p>
