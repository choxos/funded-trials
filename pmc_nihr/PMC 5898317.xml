                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Deep wound infection is a catastrophic complication after hip fracture surgery. However, current understanding of infection rates in this population is limited. Many technologies such as incisional negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) show promise in reducing the rate of infection. This trial is a feasibility study looking to establish a value estimated with a greater precision of the rate of deep infection after hip fracture treatment in patients treated with NPWT versus standard dressing following hip fracture surgery.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A randomised controlled trial of 464 patients will be run across multiple centres. It is embedded in the World Hip Trauma Evaluation cohort study. Any patient over the age of 65 years having surgery for hip fracture is eligible unless they are being treated with percutaneous screw fixation. A web-based randomisation sequence will stratify patients by centre. Patients will be allocated to either NPWT or standard care on a 1:1 basis. The primary outcome measure is the Centre for Disease Control definition of deep infection at 30 days. Follow-up at 4 months will also assess deep infection and the core outcome dataset for hip fractures. This includes health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), mobility, mortality and late complications such as further surgery. The primary analysis will be intention to treat.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hip fracture is one of the biggest challenges facing patients and healthcare systems at present. Worldwide, there are 1.3 million hip fractures with more than 65 000 hip fractures in England, Wales and Northern Ireland every year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These figures are projected to rise to &gt;100 000 by 2020 in the UK<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and more than 6 million by 2050 worldwide.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The global cost of this clinical problem is estimated at 1.75 million disability-adjusted life years lost and represents 1.4% of the total healthcare burden in established market economies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>The overwhelming majority of hip fractures are treated surgically. The principal objective of surgical treatment is to enable patients to return to weight-bearing mobilisation as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>As with all surgical treatments, one of the most important potential complications is surgical site infection (SSI). Hip fracture patients are particularly vulnerable to SSI. The reasons for this vulnerability are multifactorial. For instance, 60% of hip fracture patients have at least one major medical comorbidity such as steroid or other immunosuppressive medication use, malignancy and diabetes.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These comorbidities sit alongside age-related deterioration of immune function.</p>
              <p>SSI can be either superficial or deep. Superficial infections only involve the skin and subcutaneous tissue, whereas ‘deep’ infections involve the deeper layers and the metalwork implanted in the hip. Deep infection has profound consequences for hip fracture patients including a significantly increased hospital stay and they are 4.5 times less likely to survive to discharge.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Of those that do survive, patients with deep infection have been found to be three times less likely to return to their original residence.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These findings have been found in other large cohort studies.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Due to the severe consequences of deep infections in this patient group, a number of interventions are undertaken to try and reduce the risk of infection such as perioperative antibiotics, vigorous skin preparation and wound dressing. Wound dressing is one of the most important interventions to address the risk of postoperative infection. The role of a postoperative wound dressing is to minimise bacterial ingress into the wound, manage exudate from the wound site and protect the soft-tissues while they heal.</p>
              <p>Traditionally, the surgical incision is covered with an adhesive dressing or gauze to protect the wound from contamination from the outside environment. These ‘standard dressings’ have been used throughout the National Health Service (NHS) for many years. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an alternative form of dressing which may be applied to closed surgical incisions. In this treatment, an ‘open-cell’, solid foam overlies the incision and is covered with a semipermeable membrane which is only permeable to gas. A sealed tube is used to connect the foam to a pump, which creates a partial vacuum over the wound. This negative-pressure therapy provides a sealed environment, preventing bacterial ingress and removes blood and serous fluid exuding the wound. The application of negative pressure to the foam leads to the application of positive pressure to the wound bed and has been shown to reduce the incidence of wound haematoma.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Recent laboratory studies suggest that NPWT shifts the cytokine profile to being less inflammatory, promotes the production of proangiogenic growth factors and enzymes responsible for matrix remodelling, leading to improved wound healing.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–13</xref></p>
              <p>However, a recent Cochrane review for surgical wounds concluded, ‘it is still not clear whether NPWT promotes faster healing and reduces complications associated with clean surgery’. ‘Given the cost and widespread use of NPWT, there is an urgent need for suitably powered, high-quality trials to evaluate the effects of the newer NPWT products that are designed for use on clean, closed surgical incisions. Such trials should focus initially on wounds that may be difficult to heal’.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>The current feasibility trial will assess the feasibility of performing a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on wound dressings in this challenging population, and it will aim to estimate the current infection rates for hip fracture patients. Capture of SSI rates falls under the remit of Public Health England’s Surgical Site Infection Surveillance Programme.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Their report from 2015 reports a SSI incidence of 1.3% (95% CI 1.3% to 1.5%).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, infection rates reported in the literature for this patient group are often higher, with some reports stating rates as high as 7%.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> There is growing evidence that the surveillance system from Public Health England is providing a significant underestimate of the true incidence.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> This is borne out by local audit of hip fracture patients at two large teaching hospitals in the England, that have found infection rates between 5% and 8%, respectively (unpublished data). A reliable estimation of infection will be required to inform the sample size for a large RCT.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="s2">
              <title>Aims and objectives</title>
              <p>We aim to conduct a feasibility trial of NPWT versus standard dressing following hip fracture surgery. It is intended to obtain a reliable estimate of the rate of SSIs in the target population. In addition, feasibility will be considered in terms of other aspects of the trial such as recruiting and randomising large numbers from individual sites within a relatively short time frame.</p>
              <p>The primary objective is:</p>
              <p>To quantify differences in the rate of ‘deep infection’—as defined by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC)—after hip fracture surgery in standard dressing and NPWT. Patients will be assessed at 30 days and 4 months. We will examine how many deep infections occur, and when the diagnosis is made.</p>
              <p>Both ‘how many deep infections’ and ‘when they are diagnosed’ will be crucial to inform the design of a full-scale trial. Each time point addresses the requirements of the CDC, and the routine follow-up of patients in the current UK care pathway.</p>
              <p>The secondary objectives are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To determine the number and nature of further surgical interventions related to the injury, in the first 4 months after the index procedure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate which outcomes will be required to assess cost-effectiveness, of NPWT versus standard dressing for wounds associated with hip fracture surgery in a definitive trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine recruitment rate and willingness to participate in the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To capture the core outcome set for hip fracture studies.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <p>Exclusion criteria: Patients having percutaneous screw fixation of an undisplaced intracapsular fracture of the hip. This small subgroup of patients (less than 5% on the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD)) have very small surgical incisions—typically 1–2 cm. Where incisions are so small, it is unlikely that they will benefit from an advanced dressing like NPWT.</p>

                  <p>Patients with a hip fracture are a clinical priority for urgent operative care. They will undergo surgery on the next available trauma operating list. All patients with a fracture of the hip are in pain and have received opiate analgesia. It is therefore understandable that the majority of patients find the initial period of their treatment in hospital confusing and disorientating. Similarly, patients’ next of kin, carers and friends are often anxious at this time and may have difficulty in weighing the large amounts of information that they are given about the injury and plan for treatment. In this emergency situation, the focus is on obtaining consent for surgery (where possible) and informing the patient and any next of kin about immediate clinical care. This is supported by national guidance that recommends surgery should take place within 36 hours.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It is often not possible for the patient or relative/carer (consultee) to review trial documentation, weigh the information and communicate an informed decision about whether they would wish to participate. The consent procedure for this trial will reflect that of the surgery, with the clinical team assessing capacity before taking consent for the surgical procedure and this capacity assessment then being used to decide on the proper approach to consenting to the research. An appropriate method, in line with the mental capacity act and approved by a National Research Ethics Committee, will then be used to gain either prospective or retrospective consent from the patient or appropriate consultee by a Good Clinical Practice (GCP)-trained, appropriately delegated member of the research team.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>The treating surgeon will confirm eligibility at the end of the operative procedure, but before the wound dressing is applied. Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study via a secure, remote online randomisation system. To ensure concealment of the allocation sequence, patients will only be randomised after they have been registered on the online system. The allocation sequence will be generated by the trial statistician at the Oxford Clinical Trials Unit. Randomisation will be on a 1:1 basis, stratified by trial centre. All modern operating theatres include a computer with web access, so a secure, 24 hours, web-based randomisation system will be used to generate the treatment allocation intraoperatively.</p>

The clinical outcome data will be collected by independent research assistants who will not be blind to the treatment allocation.

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Patients with a hip fracture usually have surgery on the next available trauma operating list. Some patients may be delayed by medical factors such as anticoagulation, however, surgery will proceed as soon as is determined safe by the treating team. All patients will receive a general or regional anaesthetic. Routine prophylactic antibiotics will be given to all patients immediately before surgery and all patients will be assessed for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis according to local policy. At the end of the operation, a dressing is applied to the surgical wound. This trial will involve two types of wound dressing: standard dressing and NPWT.</p>
                <sec id="s3h1">
                  <title>Standard dressing</title>
                  <p>The standard dressing for a surgical wound comprises a non-adhesive layer applied directly to the wound that is covered by a sealed dressing. The standard dressing does not use ‘negative pressure’. The exact details of the dressing materials and duration will be left to the discretion of the treating surgeon as per their routine practice, but the details of each dressing applied in the trial will be recorded.</p>

                  <title>Negative-pressure wound therapy</title>
                  <p>The NPWT dressing uses an ‘open-cell’, solid foam layer which is laid onto the wound as an intrinsic part of a sealed dressing. A sealed tube connects the dressing to a built in mini-pump that creates a partial vacuum over the wound. This can only be kept on for 7 days according to the manufacturer that will be reflected in this study.</p>
                  <p>Any further wound dressing after the initial dressing will be recorded and will follow the allocated treatment unless otherwise clinically indicated.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome measure for this study is deep infection; We will use the CDC and Prevention definition of a ‘deep SSI’, that is a wound infection involving the tissues deep to the skin that occurs within 30 or 90 days of injury.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
                  <p>The treating clinical team will make the diagnosis of ‘deep infection’, as per routine clinical practice. The treating clinicians will not be part of the research team. Since the prompt diagnosis and treatment of infection is fundamental to the patient’s routine clinical care, the treating surgeon/clinician will always document such a change in management in the patient’s medical record.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the rate of infection, time of diagnosis will be assessed; The CDC definition applies up to the 90 days after hip fracture surgery.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, the national care pathway for hip fractures involves remote follow-up at 4 months. Therefore, to ensure that assessment meets the CDC criteria and is consistent with existing care practice, each patient will be assessed at 30 days and 4 months.</p>
                  <p>At 30 days, the patient will be assessed either as an inpatient or over the telephone according to the relevant clinical parameters.</p>
                  <p>At 4 months patients will be asked, via telephone interview, about any further symptoms of infection which may have emerged since the 30-day time point. Of the infections that are identified, we will establish when the diagnosis was made in the course of recovery.</p>

Four hundred and sixty-four is based on Wilson’s CI method at two-sided 95% significance level with 20% loss to follow-up).

Baseline data (eg, age and gender) will be summarised to check comparability between treatment arms.

                <p>Should this study demonstrate that a full-scale trial is feasible, the data from this feasibility study will be included in the final analysis of the definitive trial. This is contingent on the future definitive trial being sufficiently similar to this feasibility study. Baseline and follow-up outcome data will therefore not be released to the trial team unless the lack of feasibility is determined based on observed infection rate at the end of the feasibility study, or the definitive study cannot be conducted for other reasons (eg, lack of funding).
