                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease that leads to lung scarring. Cough is reported by 85% of patients with IPF and can be a distressing symptom with a significant impact on patients’ quality of life. There are no proven effective therapies for IPF-related cough. Whilst morphine is frequently used as a palliative agent for breathlessness in IPF, its effects on cough have never been tested. PAciFy Cough is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of morphine sulphate for the treatment of cough in IPF.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will recruit 44 subjects with IPF prospectively from three interstitial lung disease units in the UK, namely the Royal Brompton Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) and Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Patients will be randomised (1:1) to either placebo twice daily or morphine sulphate 5 mg twice daily for 14 days. They will then crossover after a 7-day washout period. The primary endpoint is the percent change in daytime cough frequency (coughs per hour) from baseline as assessed by objective cough monitoring at day 14 of treatment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This multicentre, randomised trial will assess the effect of opioids on cough counts and cough associated quality of life in IPF subjects. If proven to be an effective intervention, it represents a readily available treatment for patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par34">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic lung disease of unknown cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is irreversible and responsible for 1 in every 100 deaths each year in the UK. Despite the recent approval of two antifibrotic therapies the 5-year survival rate remains 25%, far worse than many common cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Whilst current therapies and those in development are understandably targeted at slowing the relentless progression of the disease, none attempt to alleviate any of the significant symptoms suffered by patients with IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most common symptoms reported by patients are fatigue (95%), dyspnoea (88%) and cough (85%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cough can be a distressing symptom with significant physical, social and psychological consequences, and has been shown to predict disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The majority of patients with IPF report cough at some point during their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and it has been associated with a marked impairment in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">The pathogenesis of cough in IPF is poorly understood. Patients with IPF have been shown to have a more sensitive cough reflex compared to healthy controls—both in response to inhaled challenge agents and to mechanical stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is also a suggestion that genetic polymorphisms which contribute to the risk of developing IPF may also be implicated in IPF-related cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The lack of pathogenic clarity has limited the therapeutic options available to patients and clinicians, and cough in IPF remains one of the most challenging symptoms to address. Thalidomide has been shown to be beneficial in a randomised control trial; however, its side effects profile renders it practically useless as only 20% of patients are able to tolerate it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Pirfenidone, one of the novel antifibrotic agents, has shown some promise in a recent trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] as has a nebulised form of sodium cromoglicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The reduction in objective cough frequency demonstrated by the currently available drugs to treat cough in IPF is in the order of 30%. However, this reduction has not consistently been associated with patient reports of improvements in coughing, questioning the clinical benefit afforded. There is therefore a clear unmet need to help reduce cough and improve the quality of life for patients with IPF.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Opiates have long been advocated for the suppression of cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Morphine is thought to depress the cough reflex, acting directly on the neural pathways in the brain. Antitussive effects occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. In patients with refractory chronic cough, 5–10 mg of controlled-release morphine sulphate every 12 h has been shown to cause significant suppression of cough, reducing objective cough frequency by over 70% compared to placebo in clinical responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whilst morphine is frequently used as a palliative agent for dyspnoea in IPF, its effects on cough have never been tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">The only randomised control trial evaluating opioids in chronic cough was conducted by Morice and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] in 27 patients, where a starting dose of 5 mg twice daily slow-release morphine (MST) was shown to be effective in reducing diary recorded cough scores. The study ran an open-label extension period, allowing patients to increase the dose of MST to 10 mg twice daily according to patient choice. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in cough severity or Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) score between those that took 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily. Furthermore, despite the side effects of constipation and drowsiness, all patients completed the study. This highlights the tolerability of low-dose MST.</p>
                <p id="Par38">A large longitudinal cohort study in Sweden with over 1600 oxygen-dependent ILD patients revealed that opiates were used in 15% of patients and was not associated with either increased mortality or hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This was true for both low and high dose (equivalent of 30 mg daily oral morphine or higher) therapy. This study confirms the safety of opioids in ILD patients, even in those who have more severe disease.</p>
                <p id="Par39">We present the protocol of a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial investigating the effect of low-dose morphine on cough in patients with IPF. If this study shows a favourable outcome of morphine as a treatment for IPF-related cough, this could be rapidly translatable into routine clinical practice. The data generated would also provide the information needed to plan future studies, to explore optimal dosing as well as adjunctive antitussive therapies in IPF.</p>

                <p id="Par40">The primary objective of this study is to establish whether, compared with placebo, low-dose (5 mg twice daily) controlled release morphine sulphate (MST) will reduce the number of coughs recorded during a 24-h period in patients with IPF at 14 days of treatment.</p>

                  <p id="Par100">Based on previous repeatability data in IPF patients studied over an 11-day period, a sample size of 40 subjects will have 90% power to detect a true difference in 24 h cough frequency on the natural log scale − 0.132 or 0.132 (equivalent to ~ 35% change) with a probability (power) of 0.9, assuming a within-subject standard deviation of 0.310 (natural log scale) and the standard significance level of 0.05. Allowing for a 10% drop out rate, we will aim to recruit 44 patients for the study. In a previous phase 2 study, Birring and colleagues demonstrated a 30% reduction in log transformed cough counts in IPF subjects compared to baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, a 35% reduction in cough counts in this study is likely to be of clinical importance.</p>

They provided positive feedback, commenting on the value of having the option to continue taking morphine in the community following their participation in the trial. Following the emergence of the COVID pandemic, the support group were consulted again, who suggested a reduction in the number of onsite visits, and thus the revised protocol was amended to reflect this. Finally, we have a lay member on the trial steering committee.</p>

The investigator will make the decision to un-blind and have 24-h access to un-blinding the treatment assignment via the electronic database system (Sealed Envelope EDC). If the Sealed Envelope EDC system is not accessible for technical reasons (e.g. electronic failure of the database), a manual back up system is also available. A master randomisation list will be provided to the Sponsor (RBHH) pharmacy department. If the Sealed Envelope EDC system is not accessible for technical reasons, then the investigator will contact RBHH hospital pharmacist (and/or an on-call pharmacist outside of working hours) via RBHH switchboard for the manual un-blinding of the treatment assignment. The investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in the appropriate data collection tool, eCRF. A patient will be withdrawn if their treatment code is un-blinded by the investigator or treating physician. The primary reason for discontinuation (the event or condition which led to the unblinding) will be recorded in the eCRF.</p>

                  <p id="Par108">Measurement of cough frequency will be performed using objective digital cough monitoring. The digital cough monitor (VitaloJAK) consists of a portable sound recording device, which is worn in a pouch or pocket. The small microphone is clipped onto the subject’s collar or lapel, as close as possible to the anterior neck. A continuous sound recording is made for up to 24 h. The digital recording is then processed through accompanying computer software, which automatically registers sound patterns typical for cough. Software output provides the total number of cough events over the entire time period of recording and average hourly cough frequency. A recording will be performed before and after each treatment period.</p>
                  <p id="Par109">Quality of life questionnaires can either be completed electronically on-site or sent to participants’ email addresses. These are completed at baseline and repeated at follow up visits. Routine safety blood tests including full blood count, renal and liver function tests will be undertaken in the clinical laboratories at local sites according to local policies and procedures. Copies of local reference ranges will be collected.</p>

Personnel will have individual log-on and passwords. It will be the investigator’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of all data entered and recorded in the eCRFs. Trial monitors will check the accuracy of the eCRF data against source documents. Source documents are original documents and records from which participants’ data are obtained. These also include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, correspondence and paper CRF entries.</p>
