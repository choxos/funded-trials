                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Perinatal mental health difficulties affect up to 27% of birthing parents during pregnancy and the first postnatal year, and if untreated are associated with difficulties in bonding and long-term adverse outcomes to children. There are large evidence gaps related to psychological treatment, particularly in group therapy approaches and parent-infant interventions. One intervention showing preliminary efficacious findings and user acceptability is Circle of Security-Parenting (COS-P), which is a brief, weekly, group programme. However, these studies were underpowered and predominantly non-randomised, and there has never been a research trial in England or with birthing parents experiencing severe and complex perinatal mental health difficulties. The aim of the research is to conduct a randomised control trial to test whether COS-P will reduce perinatal mental health symptoms in birthing parents accessing NHS perinatal mental health services, compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Secondary objectives include exploring whether the intervention improves parenting sensitivity, emotion regulation skills, attachment security and infant development. Additionally, the project aims to examine whether the intervention is acceptable to parents and NHS staff, and whether it is cost-effective.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">COSI is an individually randomised, single-blind parallel arm controlled trial with an embedded internal pilot aiming to recruit 369 participants in a 2:1 ratio (intervention: TAU). Participants will be recruited from ten NHS community perinatal mental health services in England and screened based on clinical levels of both mental health symptoms (average CORE-OM score ≥ 1.1) and postnatal bonding difficulties (total PBQ score ≥ 12). This trial has 90% power to detect a MCID of 5 points on the CORE-OM. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, 3, 7 and 12 months after baseline. Service use and quality of life measures will also be collected alongside a process evaluation of parents’ and interveners’ views and experiences.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This will be the first large pragmatic trial to test whether COS-P is effective for birthing parents with severe and complex perinatal mental health difficulties in improving their mental health symptoms. If shown to be effective, the intervention could be delivered widely across the NHS and other similar services globally.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par42">Mental health difficulties that develop, continue, or worsen during pregnancy and the first postnatal year (i.e. the perinatal period) are a significant public health concern globally. Perinatal mental health difficulties (PMHD) are common, with a population prevalence in birthing parents of up to 27% in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and higher rates being found in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They are also associated with marked morbidity and mortality for birthing parents, their infants, their wider family and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Untreated PMHD confers a significant financial burden; an economic evaluation based on UK data found that this amounted to £8.1 billion per birth cohort, with 72% of this cost attributed to the long-term morbidity of the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the development of this child morbidity is complex and multifactorial, research strongly indicates that it arises, in part, from changes in the quality of the parent-infant relationship when a birthing parent is experiencing mental health difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">There is considerable international variation in how public services identify and manage PMHD, including within universal (e.g. maternity and child health) and specialist services. England has benefitted from rapid government investment in perinatal mental health services (PMHS) in the last decade, with more than £500 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] of new funding being shared across the NHS to ensure that birthing parents with complex and severe PMHD can access evidence-based interventions in a timely manner. This programme of work has led to the establishment of multi-disciplinary NHS perinatal mental health services (PMHS) in every geographical region in England. PMHS need clinically effective and cost-effective psychological interventions. However, the evidence base for such interventions in the perinatal period is mixed with the most recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for antenatal and postnatal mental health identifying various gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These include interventions that (a) work transdiagnostically with a range of (comorbid) perinatal mental health difficulties; (b) target both symptoms of psychopathology and parent-infant relationship quality; and (c) are delivered in a group format. Nonetheless, some group-based, transdiagnostic psychological interventions are showing preliminary efficacious findings and are already being adopted widely by psychologists working in NHS community PMHS. One of these interventions is Circle of Security-Parenting (COS-P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, COS-P has not yet been rigorously evaluated in England and in the context of PMHS. The need for an English specific trial is particularly pertinent as many international trials that conclude an intervention outperforms TAU, does not do so in the England as NHS TAU is more comprehensive than many North American and even European service provisions (e.g. Family Nurse Partnership [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). We therefore propose to conduct a definitive trial of COS-P to determine its clinical and cost-effectiveness as an intervention offered to this population.</p>
                <p id="Par44">The proposed trial addresses the key gaps in the intervention evidence base discussed here: transdiagnostic approaches, bonding difficulties and group therapies. The rationale for the importance of each of these will be discussed in turn.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Birthing parents entering PMHS often present with multiple mental health difficulties and comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], making it difficult for clinicians to select the most appropriate intervention for treatment, as NICE guidelines predominantly use a single diagnostic framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], e.g. high-intensity CBT for moderate to severe depression. However, there is growing evidence for transdiagnostic models of psychopathology, which suggest that many mental health difficulties are manifestations of a small number of core underlying features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A body of research indicates that emotion regulation difficulties are one of these core transdiagnostic constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which re-iterates the need for developing and testing treatments that target emotion regulation for individuals who present with multiple mental health difficulties. Emotion regulation is a particularly relevant intervention target in the postnatal period as it impacts both birthing parent and infant.</p>
                <p id="Par46">A key early developmental task is an infant’s acquisition of skills for regulating their emotional states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Parents play a key role in helping with this, and in turn supporting the infant’s brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There is strong evidence that perinatal mental health difficulties can disrupt this process. For example, it has been found that birthing parents with emotion regulation problems have difficulties thinking about their baby’s thoughts and feelings (i.e. reflective functioning; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), and are more likely to experience bonding problems. Therefore, research is needed to examine the effectiveness of treatments that address transdiagnostic constructs such as emotion regulation, particularly in PMHS. There has been very little research examining the effectiveness of interventions that target both perinatal mental health and bonding difficulties; particularly in relation to birthing parents of infants under 12 months, and critically with birthing parents with complex and severe perinatal mental health difficulties who are accessing PMHS. Where research has taken place with these populations, studies often have had very small sample sizes and poor-quality methodology and were conducted outside the UK, in the USA and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, currently, PMHS assess and treat PMHD and bonding difficulties separately with different staff groups leading on the different difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It could therefore be cost-effective and potentially more acceptable to both parents and staff to deliver an intervention that addresses both needs.</p>
                <p id="Par47">A group context is likely to be particularly valuable for new parents with mental health difficulties, as the constructive, supportive environment created in the group as well as the commonality of the problems are known to diminish feelings of isolation, enable group members to share their mental health and parenting-related struggles, learn from each other and feel validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par48">A 2016 meta-analysis of studies involving COS-P programmes found a total of 10 eligible studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; however, very few of these studies were RCTs, none of the studies included populations in the perinatal period and none of the studies specifically targeted samples with mental health symptoms. Since this review, four trials across Europe, Australia and the USA have evaluated the effectiveness of the COS-P intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] with sample sizes of 141, 52, 221 and 72 respectively. Again, the conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are limited by being underpowered and again their lack of specificity to the perinatal period for complex and severe PMHD. A full-scale England-based trial is therefore warranted.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par49">The primary objective of this research is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether COS-P reduces the mental health symptoms of birthing parents accessing specialist NHS community PMHS compared to Treatment As Usual (TAU).</p>
                <p id="Par50">The secondary objectives of this research are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par51">To explore whether COS-P improves emotion regulation difficulties, parental sensitivity, parent-infant bonding, attachment security and social support.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">To examine whether COS-P has an impact on infant development.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">To explore whether COS-P is acceptable and accessible to parents and NHS staff, e.g. exploring barriers and facilitators to taking part in COS-P, and exploring contextual factors that may influence the acceptability of COS-P.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">To explore possible mechanisms of change, e.g. exploring contextual factors that may influence effectiveness of COS-P.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par55">To determine whether COS-P is cost-effective or not.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par56">To investigate whether there is value of information associated with the trial results.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par57">The primary hypothesis is that COS-P is superior to TAU with respect to decreasing mental health difficulties in birthing parents, measured with the CORE-OM averaged over the 3-, 7- and 12-month follow-up assessments. Secondly, it is hypothesised that relative to the control group, participants receiving COS-P will show an increase in parental emotion regulation, increase in quality of life, increase in social support, increase in parenting sensitivity, decrease in parent-infant relationship difficulties, increase in infant attachment security and an improvement in infant global and socio-emotional developmental outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par58">The emphasis of the qualitative process evaluation concerns acceptability and accessibility; however, it is recognised in the Medical Research Council guidance that additional questions may be identified during the evaluation, requiring that the process evaluation ‘be designed with sufficient flexibility and resources to allow important emerging questions to be addressed’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par59">This is a multi-centre RCT with follow-up assessments for up to 1-year post-baseline. Programme theory informed all decisions on trial design and analyses plans. The trial includes a 2:1 randomisation ratio with all outcome assessors blind to intervention allocation. Participants are randomised to either:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par60">The intervention arm consisting of COS-P plus TAU in a PMHS</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par61">The control arm consisting of TAU in a PMH</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par62">The COSI trial uses a mixed methods design (see Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). All parent participants are invited to one pre-intervention and three post-intervention assessments with quantitative measures. Additionally, the trial includes an embedded process evaluation, in which a combination of survey methods, interviews and focus groups will be used to gather the views and experiences of parent participants in the intervention arm, and clinical staff involved in delivering the intervention. Consistent with the Medical Research Council guidance on developing and evaluating complex intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the process evaluation will enable exploration of the acceptability and accessibility of COS-P with different groups of stakeholders and exploration of contextual factors that may influence mechanisms of change and the effectiveness of COS-P, which can be used to refine the trial’s Theory of Change model.</p>
                <p id="Par63">The trial includes a 12-month internal pilot to establish that trial procedures work well in terms of recruiting and retaining participants. Additionally, intervention attendance and fidelity to the manual of COS-P delivery will be checked. The internal pilot progression criteria and further details are listed in Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. In the event of any of the criteria not being met, the trial team will work together with the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) to review strategies for improvement or the TSC will recommend the termination of the trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par78">Trial recruitment takes place across seven, 4-week recruitment blocks over the 20-month recruitment period. Information about the trial will be publicised widely among clinical colleagues working in all recruiting PMHS sites. PMHS staff will approach birthing parents about the trial during standard screening meetings (e.g. intake assessments, review meetings). Participants that meet the CORE-10/CORE-OM and PBQ eligibility criteria (further details on screening can be found in Additional File <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) will be given a Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and recruitment leaflet and asked to provide verbal consent to be contacted by a member of the research team to discuss this information further. This will be done with the help of an interpreter if needed. Existing scores on the CORE-10 or CORE-OM and the PBQ assessed within 6 weeks prior to the beginning of a recruitment block are also accepted as screening scores for the trial. Staff members completing screening measures will not be involved in the intervention delivery; however, it is probable that they will be involved in the delivery of TAU at some sites. Birthing parents who do not provide verbal consent to be contacted by the trial team will be asked to complete a short survey about their decision. The survey was created in collaboration with the trial’s Expert by Experience (EbE) panel and includes factors/barriers which may have influenced the birthing parents’ decision as well as an option to list additional reasons. Contact details and CORE and PBQ scores of those who do provide verbal consent will be shared securely with the research team via email. A member of the study team then contacts the individual to discuss the trial in detail, assess eligibility and obtain informed consent. In all instances, potential participants will have at least 24 h before deciding whether they wish to take part. All trial documents, including the PIS, will be provided in alternative languages where required. Informed consent for the interview will be recorded using Microsoft Forms. A copy of the PIS and completed informed consent form (ICF) will be shared with participants and their clinical team. The family doctor of each participant will be notified of their participation.</p>

Approximately 3 months after the baseline assessment has been completed, all birthing parents in the intervention arm will be asked to share their views and experiences regarding COS-P, including barriers and facilitators to taking part. Non-starters will be asked to complete a three-item ‘non-starters’ survey to report the reasons. Completers and non-completers will be asked to complete a short experience survey and indicate their interest in taking part in an interview. All surveys can be self-completed or completed with the assistance of a member of the study team, either remotely (by telephone or Teams) or in person. A subsample of completers and all non-completers will be invited by a member of the study team to be interviewed and provided with a PIS and opportunity to ask any questions.

                <p id="Par84">All participants allocated to the intervention arm of the trial will receive COS-P alongside the TAU offered by their service. COS-P is a group intervention designed to provide social support and peer connection in parents experiencing bonding difficulties with their child. Based on psycho-educational, cognitive-behavioural and psychodynamic theories and techniques, COS-P is delivered by a trained, supervised, NHS staff member (predominantly doctorate level clinical and counselling psychologists) to groups of 4–6 birthing parents. The intervention involves 8 treatment modules which are delivered remotely online over 10 weekly, 90-min sessions (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for details). The module contents include video clips of parent–child interactions and reflections of previous COS-P participants. Topics covered in COS-P include the basic concepts of attachment, responding to children’s affective states, reflecting on caregiving struggles and noticing mean (hostile), weak (helpless) and gone (neglecting) parenting.

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par87">Adherence to the intervention is facilitated in several ways. Firstly, potential participants are informed of the dates, times and location of the intervention sessions before they decide to participate. Potential issues around attendance are discussed and resolved, i.e. the trial covers childcare and transportation costs for the face-to-face sessions and a tablet with data can be arranged for the virtual sessions. Facilitators are encouraged to schedule pre-group individual calls with everyone assigned to their group and to reach out to anyone who misses a session to allow a smooth re-entry in the group.</p>
                <p id="Par88">Also, the trial explores treatment fidelity of COS-P within the trial. Each facilitator delivering COS-P within the trial will be trained in its delivery by accredited COS International trainers and are given a clear group delivery manual to follow. Additionally, all facilitators undertake 20 h of fidelity coaching. The fidelity coaching includes 10, 2-h coaching sessions with a supervisor from COS International. Lastly, all facilitators will receive supervision from expert therapists at their PMHS trained in parenting interventions and/or COS-P.</p>
                <p id="Par89">Fidelity of delivery will be checked by recording all ten sessions of one full group for each intervener. A randomly selected 20% of recorded videos will be coded for fidelity to the manual. A criterion of 75% adherence to the COS-P manual will be used to ensure that the treatment administered meets the standards of fidelity required for the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par90">Additionally, attendance to the intervention sessions is monitored and 6/10 sessions is considered a clinical dose. When participants miss a session, an individual catch-up session is offered to help them re-enter the group and this does not itself constitute attendance of an intervention session.</p>

                <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                <p id="Par97">A change in CORE-OM of 5 has been proposed as a meaningful improvement and a reliable change that exceeds that which might be expected by chance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a 2009 trial, Morrell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] reported that in a sample of birthing parents with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores ≥ 12 (i.e. birthing parents with probable perinatal mental health difficulties), the mean score on the CORE-OM had a standard deviation of 0.5. A change in total score of 5 equates to an average mean item change of 0.147. The CORE-OM total change score we are using was strongly endorsed by our EbE panel as being meaningful. A between measurements within subject correlation of 0.35 were estimated, from unpublished clinical audit data on 71 birthing parents in a specialist community perinatal mental health service.</p>
                <p id="Par98">We choose to use a 2:1 ratio to randomise to increase motivation of participants to take part in the trial due to the perceived benefit of the intervention, and with consideration to the practicality of filling up recruitment blocks in a timely manner, as we need at least 4 participants within each COS-P group.</p>
                <p id="Par99">With 104 parents in the control arm and 208 parents (<italic>N</italic> = 312) in the intervention arm, we will have 90% power to detect a minimally clinically important average mean item change of 0.147, assuming a <italic>SD</italic> of 0.5, three repeated measurements with a correlation of 0.35 and using a 5% significance threshold. Previous small trials have reported 15–20% missing at follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] by the end of the trial. In the current trial, participants will be rigorously followed up and those who have at least one post-randomisation measurement will be included in the analysis. We therefore assume it is reasonable to obtain one post-randomisation measurement of the primary outcome in at least 90% and therefore factor in 10% missing. As the intervention is delivered in groups, there is potential for clustering of the outcomes in the active arm. We do not have reliable data to inform us what the intra-cluster correlation (ICC) coefficient in this context is. However, even if the ICC were large (&gt; 0.05), the intervention group size is small so the effect will be limited. It is not expected this clustering will greatly affect the results. To protect against any potential effect in the absence of information, we inflated the sample size by an additional 5% to take into account the potential for one-arm clustering. Taking into account the potential for clustering (5%) and missing data (10%), we will aim to recruit a total of 369 birthing parents (<italic>n</italic> = 246 and <italic>n</italic> = 123 per arm). This was calculated using the time-averaged difference test in the PASS statistical software.</p>
                <p id="Par100">For the embedded qualitative component, we have estimated interviewing 20–30 completers, which is consistent with other HTA-funded process evaluations (e.g. ISRCTN12655391, ISRCTN34701576) and aim to interview all non-completers. The total sample size will be guided by principles of data saturation concerning meaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and with emphasis on data quality. It is therefore not possible to determine the exact sample size in advance. Focus groups with staff will use total population sampling, i.e. inviting all members of those groups.</p>

                <p id="Par118">The primary analysis aims to estimate the treatment policy estimand. We will use the intention-to-treat principle including all participants who undergo randomisation and have at least one post-randomisation measure at the 3-month, 7-month or 12-month follow-up trial assessment. As a result of this, the number of participants missing from the primary analysis model is expected to be low. A safety population consisting of all participants who attend at least one session of the assigned intervention will be used for the analysis of adverse events. For participants in the TAU arm of the trial, this will be defined as any participant randomised to TAU as per the intention-to-treat population. Baseline characteristics will be summarised by treatment arm and by using suitable measures of central tendencies. The flow of participants through the trial and trial results will be reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT).</p>

                  <title>Primary analyses</title>
                  <p id="Par119">For the primary analysis, we will use a mixed effects linear regression model to estimate the mean difference in CORE-OM between arms over 3-, 7- and 12-month follow-up trial assessments and a Bayesian mixed effects linear regression model using vague priors. From the Bayesian model, we will obtain the posterior probability of the intervention being superior to TAU, as well as the posterior probability of treatment effect exceeding the pre-specified Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of 5 points in the CORE-OM. In the mixed effects linear regression model, participants and recruitment cohort (in the intervention arm to account for group clustering in one arm) will be included as random intercepts. Fixed effects in the model will be intervention arm, site, and baseline CORE-OM, infant sex, infant age and infant first born status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The mean difference in CORE-OM over 3-, 7- and 12-month follow-up trial assessments will be reported, with accompanying 95% confidence intervals, and <italic>p</italic>-value will be presented.</p>
                  <p id="Par120">A Bayesian mixed effects linear regression model will be fitted and follows the same form as the frequentist mixed effects linear regression model described above. We will use vague (large variance) normal priors for regression coefficients and inverse-gamma priors for the error variance and for the variance of random intercepts which have been chosen to be uninformative. Model convergence will be investigated for the parameters of primary interest (specifically the treatment effect estimate) using graphical diagnostics. The intervention effect will also be estimated at the 3-, 7- and 12-month follow-up trial assessments using a Bayesian mixed effects linear regression model with a model including time point and adding a time-by-intervention arm interaction.</p>

The economic evaluation estimates the incremental cost per QALY associated with COS-P. Net monetary benefit of the intervention and TAU is assessed using the NICE lower and upper threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Additionally, the trial is supported by a Patient and Public Involvement co-applicant who leads an active Expert by Experience (EbE) panel. The EbE panel consists of around ten panel members and its role is to ensure that the participants’ perspective is kept in mind in every aspect of the COSI Study. The panel meet quarterly to provide feedback on participant facing documents as well as provide useful insights in aiding the smooth operation for the research team and facilitators. Individually, the panel members’ involvement can vary from giving feedback on certain documents/scenarios to database testing that ensures the systems we have in place are user friendly and that the research assistants are equipped to smoothly run study visits. Panel members are also invited to the COSI monthly meetings, where they can share live feedback with the wider research team. The panel also has two subgroups in which they focus on specific aspects on the study. There is the EDI subgroup, who look to ensure that the study is being as inclusive as possible when recruiting parents who are ethnically diverse. They meet on a semi-regular basis to discuss ways in which we can make this study more accessible to them, and things we should take into consideration when communicating with marginalised communities.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par154">To the best of our knowledge, the COSI study is the first fully powered randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of COS-P for birthing parents with complex and severe mental health difficulties in the perinatal period and will include the largest process evaluation of its kind worldwide.</p>
              <p id="Par155">The treatment and prevention of parental psychopathology and parent-infant relationship difficulties in the perinatal period are areas of key concern to the NHS and public services globally, but there are numerous gaps in the evidence of effective psychological interventions during this critical time in family life. The proposed research aims to address the specific research recommendations in the NICE antenatal and postnatal guideline recommendations on evaluating group programmes in the perinatal period: interventions that target difficulties in both parental psychopathology and the parent-infant relationship difficulties; and transdiagnostic approaches of intervention. The study, if effective in treating parental psychopathology, will lead to improved short- and long-term outcomes for birthing parents and their children across a range of domains, including improved psychiatric, educational and physical health outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par156">The study has been designed with dissemination in mind. Our choice of the CORE-OM as the primary outcome was motivated by it being one of the most widely used outcome measures in secondary care mental health services, including PMHS, and as such, is familiar to service managers, as well as local and national commissioners. It is also compatible with the national Mental Health Service Dataset. In this way, we hypothesise that any changes detected on it as a result of this trial will be highly compelling to key decision-making stakeholders and have the potential to positively impact clinical practice.</p>
              <p id="Par157">This is a study that has the voice of birthing parents at its foundation; experts by experience have been involved in the study from inception to grant writing to study delivery. The idea for the trial came from the recommendation of experts by experience. The study team benefit from a large, diverse, activated expert by experience panel who are a core part of the study team and we have three members of the EbE panel being trained as qualitative researchers. In this way, we ensure that all aspects of study delivery reflect on the experience of—and benefit to—birthing parents themselves.</p>

              <title>Availability of data and materials {29}</title>
              <p>The anonymised quantitative datasets (e.g. questionnaire data but not video recordings) generated during the current study will be available as de-identified data upon request from Peter Fonagy and Camilla Rosan (peter.fonagy@annafreud.org; camilla.rosan@annafreud.org), beginning 12 months and ending 5 years after the primary publication and pre-planned secondary analysis following approval of a methodologically sound proposal and a signed data-sharing agreement. The transcripts from the interviews and focus groups will not be made available because, whilst the names of places and people will have been removed, the combination of contextual information given by participants could compromise their anonymity if the transcripts were available in their entirety.</p>
