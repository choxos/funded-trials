                  <p>Salt intake in China is twice the upper limit recommended by the WHO, and nearly 80% of salt is added during cooking. This study will develop a package of salt reduction interventions targeting home cooks and evaluate its effectiveness and feasibility for scale-up.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A cluster randomised controlled trial design is adopted in this study, which will be conducted in six provinces covering northern, central and southern China. For each province, 10 communities/villages (clusters) with 13 families (one cook and one adult family member) will be selected in each cluster for evaluation. In total, 780 home cooks and 780 adult family members will be recruited. The home cooks in the intervention group will be provided with the intervention package, including community-based standardised offline and online health education and salt intake monitoring. The duration of the intervention will be 1 year. The primary outcome is the difference between the intervention and control group in change in salt intake as measured by 24 hours urinary sodium from baseline to the end of the trial. The secondary outcome is the difference between the two groups in the change in salt-related knowledge, attitude and practice and blood pressure (BP).</p>

              <p>Excess dietary salt consumption is an important risk factor for high BP, stroke, cardiovascular disease and other adverse health outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> As a result, in 2003, the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization issued a joint report calling for a reduction in salt intake in the population to less than 5 g per day (&lt;2,000 mg sodium).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It has been estimated that the mean salt consumption in 181 of 187 countries exceeded the daily intake of salt recommended by the WHO in 2010, and 51 of these countries reported mean intakes greater than double the recommended amount.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In April 2019, the <italic>Lancet</italic> published the latest series of studies on the global burden of disease,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which found that 3 million deaths were attributable to a high-salt diet in 2017.</p>
              <p>Salt reduction is highly cost-effective worldwide.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> It has been estimated that a regulatory intervention to reduce salt intake by 3 g per day would save 194,000 to 392,000 quality-adjusted life-years and $10–$24 billion in healthcare costs every year in the USA.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> At the United Nations General Assembly in 2011, the WHO identified population salt reduction as a priority intervention for ameliorating the global burden of non-communicable diseases.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In 2013, the WHO member states agreed on a global target of a 30% relative reduction salt intake in the population to be achieved by 2025.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Many developed countries have introduced programmes that seek to reduce population-level salt intake, including the UK, Finland, Japan, the USA and Canada.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>In China, the current salt intake situation is not satisfactory. High salt intake is the third leading risk factor contributing to death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A cohort of 16,869 Chinese adults aged 20–60 years over the period of 1991–2009 indicated that salt intake remains at high levels, double those of WHO recommendations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A study used two methods (24 hours urine collection and 24 hours dietary recall) to measure salt intake in rural China, and the results showed that mean 24 hours urinary sodium excretion was 13 g and 24 hours dietary salt intake was 10 g.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In 2012, a report examining Chinese residents’ chronic diseases and nutrition using a dietary survey showed that the average daily salt intake for Chinese adults was 10.5 g.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>In contrast to Western countries, in China, most dietary salt comes from salt and high-salt condiments that are added during cooking. A survey involving nine provinces of China showed that, in 2006, the main sources of dietary sodium were from salt in home cooking (71.5%) followed by soy sauce (8.3%).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>The Chinese government has been making great efforts in salt intake surveillance and salt reduction interventions. The Shandong-MOH Action on Salt and Hypertension project<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and Healthy Lifestyle for All initiative<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> are two representative interventions. Culturally tailored salt reduction interventions have been applied in various groups and sites, including the distribution of salt restriction spoons and the encouragement of people to use the minimum amount of salt to reduce the amount of salt added during cooking.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, the effect of such interventions must be evaluated in a more rigorous way.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p>Since cooking salt is the largest source of salt intake in China, home cooks, who are responsible for purchasing food and preparing meals for their families, should be given special attention during intervention activities. In Japan, cooking classes for housewives effectively reduced salt intake from 9.57 g/day to 8.95 g/day after a 2-month intervention.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In China, studies specifically focusing on salt reduction among housewives are scarce, and the type of interventions that are effective for family salt reduction remain unclear. Hence, this study will be undertaken among home cooks in six provinces of China to explore the feasibility of reducing salt intake by means of community-based intervention which, if proven successful, will be applied on a broader scale.</p>
              <p>Our primary objective is to increase salt awareness in home cooks and to reduce the amount of salt used during cooking, thus helping the population reduce salt intake by at least 1 g/day. The specific objectives include the following: (1) to develop a package of salt reduction interventions through home cooks that are applicable to community families and (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention package by carrying out a cluster randomised trial with an intervention duration of 12 months.</p>

                <p>Based on the School-EduSalt trial,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> assuming an SD of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion of 85 mmol/day and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05, we estimated that a sample size of 1,426 individuals (713 home cooks and 713 family members) would provide a power of 80% (with a two-sided alpha=0.05) to detect a difference in mean 24-hour urinary sodium ≥20 mmol/day (1 g/day salt) between the intervention and control group, allowing for a 20% drop-out rate of participants. We aim to recruit one home cook and one family member per household to ensure that the number of households in every community remains the same. We will select 12 households in each community, resulting in a total of 720 households and 1,440 individuals. In addition, considering that the response rate of 24 hours urine collection is often low,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> we have decided to add one more family per community, resulting in the recruitment of 1,560 individuals (780 home cooks and 780 family members) into the study for evaluation.</p>

                <p>The participants will be carefully instructed on how to accurately collect 24-hour urine by trained research staff. On the first day, the participants will be asked to visit the survey location. The researchers will ask the participants to empty their bladders and discard the urine. The researchers will record the start time and date of the 24-hour urine collection. They will then supply the participants with collection equipment including containers and collection aids. At the same time, on the second day, the participants will be asked to bring the urine collection bottles back to the survey location and to pass the last urine into the container. The researchers will record the finish time of the 24-hour urine collection. During the 24-hour urine collection period, the participants will be asked to take spare urine containers with them to work. In case the participant misses one or more urine voids or spillage occurs, the participant will be asked to perform an additional 24-hour urine collection. For each participant, the 24-hour urine will be collected on the same days of the week for the baseline visit and follow-up visit at the end of the trial. We will measure urine volume, sodium, potassium and creatinine. An ion-selective electrode method will be used for sodium and potassium analysis and an enzymatic method for the creatinine assay. The 24-hour urinary creatinine together with the urine volume will be used to determine if the collection is likely to be complete. The biochemist who performs the measurements of urinary electrolytes will be unaware of the group to which the participant is allocated.</p>
                <p>In addition to 24-hour urine collection, we will measure BP and heart rate using a validated automatic machine with the appropriate cuff size. Three readings will be taken for the right arm at 1–2 min intervals in a sitting position after the participant has rested for 10 min in a quiet room. Body weight, height and waist circumference will also be measured. A survey on KAP related to salt will be completed via questionnaire.</p>
                <p>The RCT data will be collected through a specially designed mobile device-based electronic data capture system (mEDC) by well-trained field investigators. The RCT data include information on demographics, social-economic information, KAP, measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, BP, heart rate, 24-hour urine volume and electrolytes, as well as information about the intervention.</p>

                <p>The study will provide a feasible and effective approach to achieving a sustainable reduction in salt intake by targeting home cooks. The offline intervention methods combined with the online intervention are particularly advantageous over traditional methods. Therefore, the results should be generally applicable to the whole Chinese population. If the programme is implemented and sustained across China, it will reduce population salt intake and thereby prevent hundreds of thousands of strokes, heart attacks and heart failure each year, leading to major cost-savings to individuals, their families and health services.</p>
                <p>Although our study will be conducted in China, the home cook intervention programme to reduce salt could potentially be adopted by many other countries where most of the salt in the diet is added by consumers, which will have great public health implications.</p>
