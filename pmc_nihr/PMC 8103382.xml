                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Brain-related visual impairments, also known as cerebral visual impairment (CVI), are related to damage or poor function in the vision-related areas of the brain. There is broad agreement that CVI is an appropriate term to describe visual impairments that are not accounted by disorders of the eye or optic nerve, but differences remain as to which impairments can be included in this term. The CVI project is a programme of work that includes the development of a complex intervention to share knowledge with teachers, so that they can make both targeted and universal changes to support children with CVI. A feasibility study for a cluster-randomised controlled trial to evaluate this intervention is underway. This paper describes the protocol for an accompanying process evaluation to explore how the intervention is implemented and provide context for the interpretation of the feasibility trial outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A logic model has been developed to guide data collection. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, the study design and explore how any changes that occur are brought about. Interviews with key primary school staff and parents will investigate responses to the intervention and trial processes. Surveys will collect data on intervention implementation and knowledge of CVI. Photographs of classroom walls will document any changes to visual clutter and document analysis will look for changes to school special educational needs and disability (SEND) policies.</p>

                  <p>Ethical approval was granted by the University of Bristol Faculty of Health Sciences Ethics Committee. Findings will contribute to the development of a full-scale cluster-randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of the intervention with adequate statistical power. The results will also support the refinement of the intervention and its underlying theory.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Damage or poor function in the brain areas related to vision leads to brain-related visual impairments, also known collectively as cerebral visual impairment (CVI).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> CVI in children can manifest in many ways; for example, being unable to find things on a cluttered page; bumping into people; being unable to copy from the class whiteboard to their own workbooks or difficulties controlling their eye position effectively to keep focused on a task.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It has been reported that vision problems may be misinterpreted by teachers as behavioural, learning or intellectual difficulties<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and so children with CVI may not get the help they need. Concern has been raised that missing a diagnosis of CVI can affect mental health,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> and research from a UK birth cohort suggested that children with CVI may experience academic difficulties.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Research into strategies to support children with CVI has suggested that providing a less cluttered visual environment may help.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p>
              <p>In preparation for this study, discussions with two parent advisory groups, and with an advisory group comprising local health and education professionals, have reinforced accounts that simple adaptations of the child’s visual world can be very helpful. They emphasise children’s improved sense of well-being when they can achieve more and are not chastised for behaviour resulting from their CVI. They have told us that access to help is uneven between and within different areas of the country, and, therefore, is inequitable, and that few teachers, special educational needs co-ordinators (SENCO) or learning support assistants know about CVI. In general, only children with reduced visual acuity have access to specialist vision support teachers and so many children with CVI but with good visual acuity are ineligible for their help. A prevalence study conducted by our group has indicated that there are likely to be at least 3% of children with CVI-related vision problems in primary schools in England and that these are largely but not exclusively within the subset of children already identified as needing extra educational help.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>

                <title>Aim of the process evaluation</title>
                <p>The aim of the CVI project process evaluation (PE) is to understand both the functioning of the trial processes and the intervention itself. This understanding is crucial to the development and decision to proceed to the full trial.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>We have spoken with two groups of parents whose children have special educational needs and/or CVI. They have been consulted at every stage of the research so far and provided guidance on which measures to use with parents and which topics to include in qualitative interviews. During the study design phase, the parents advised us on the need to raise awareness in schools about CVI, and we changed our draft intervention pack to include specific resources to address this. They were clear that teachers should be reimbursed for their time to take part in the study and that we should outline the potential benefits of identifying CVI, whereby the right strategies can be put in place, freeing up teacher time not spent trying ineffective interventions. They also advised us that schools might appreciate the benefit of being able to demonstrate to the Office for Standards in Education inspectors that they were implementing strategies to support students who may be struggling with their learning.</p>

                <title>The CVI project intervention</title>
                <p>We have developed an intervention pack that seeks to share knowledge with teachers so that they can make both universal and targeted changes within their school, to better support children with CVI and potentially other children too.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
                <p>The development of the intervention pack is based on recent guidance, including a review of the published literature, using an iterative process of development and refining, involving key stakeholders, developing an underlying theory that takes into account the context and possible real-world implementation issues.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The key elements of the intervention and the hypothesised outcomes are summarised in a logic model—see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>We hypothesise that this multi-faceted approach, involving both schools and the hospital service, will improve educational and wellbeing-related outcomes for any child with CVI and potentially for their peers as well. We have, therefore, devised an information sharing pack to give schools this information. This includes an overview and explanations of the condition and gives suggestions as to how to make the school more ‘vision friendly’. Central to this is to use universal approaches wherever possible—for instance, decluttering walls and classrooms, using larger font and clear layouts with worksheets. Additional targeted strategies, for use with at-risk children, will also be given, with explanations about who might benefit from these, how they are intended to work and their potential impact. The information included in the intervention pack for teachers is collated from several centres of excellence that have developed materials about CVI, including Bartiméus in the Netherlands<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and the international TeachCVI initiative (www.Teachcvi,net).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The intervention also includes sharing information with the local paediatric ophthalmology clinics about the presentations of and support for children with CVI, so that they are happy to accept referrals of at-risk children. Intervention schools will be able to refer a maximum 5% of children to the paediatric ophthalmology clinic for a functional visual CVI assessment. A printout of the CVI assessment will be available to the family and school with strategies where applicable.</p>
                <p>A logic model showing proposed mechanisms of change, impact and outcomes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. This model has been refined throughout our intervention development with parents and professionals and includes consideration of unintended negative consequences of the intervention, or ‘dark logic’, as proposed by Bonell and colleagues.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>

                <title>The CVI project feasibility trial</title>
                <p>The intervention and trial processes are being tested in a cluster-randomised feasibility trial, with the nested process and health economic evaluations. The main aim of this trial is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of our intervention and trial methods, to inform the development of a future adequately powered cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT), if warranted.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The full protocol for the feasibility trial is presented separately and is summarised here, to give context for the PE, which is described in detail below.</p>
                <p>The feasibility trial involves mainstream primary schools in three regions of the UK: Gloucester, Hampshire and Somerset. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected on students recruited in years 3–5 attending participating schools.</p>
                <p>In designing the study, we were aware of two challenges; first, that in real life it would be impractical to examine all children to look for CVI and second that even if those were possible, once identified, we would need to help the affected children and would not, therefore, have a control group. However, in our recent study,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> we found that most children with CVI were found within the group of children getting extra help at school, and these children are easily identifiable by schools. In this feasibility trial, therefore, the primary outcome (child self-reported mental well-being) will be assessed in all children who are getting extra help, rather than in only children with confirmed CVI. We will not assess every child in the study for CVI.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In addition, we also found some children with CVI-related vision problems who were not getting extra help, and we hypothesise many children might benefit from some aspects of the intervention, for example, decluttering the classroom to make the visual environment less busy. We will, therefore, collect data for <italic>all</italic> children in years 3–5. The primary outcome of child-reported quality of life will be assessed in the children getting extra help, and we will include all children in an additional (secondary) analysis using the same outcome.</p>
                <p>After baseline data are collected, a statistician separate from the study will randomise the participating schools, with two stratification variables to maintain similar sample sizes in each arm<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (1) 15% or less of children having extra help or more than 15% of children and (2) size of school (three more classes per year vs two or fewer classes per year, in years 3–5). Schools will be told immediately whether they are allocated to the control group (and will be asked to carry on as normal for the school year) or the intervention group (where they will be invited to implement the CVI intervention pack, described above).</p>
                <p>Some of the outcomes of the feasibility study will be assessed using data collected during the study in a PE. The PE will use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods for data collection. Complex interventions are described as those which contain several interacting components and may also relate to the implementation of the intervention and its interaction with its context.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> PEs embedded within complex interventions aim to understand the functioning of an intervention by examining implementation, mechanisms of impact and contextual factors.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> There are several frameworks that combine these aspects of PE within feasibility of complex interventions and RCTs; for this study, our framework is based on guidance from the Medical Research Council (MRC).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We have used this guidance to develop the aims and conceptual framework for this PE. These are described below.</p>
                <p>The seven domains to be evaluated as recommended by MRC guidance are as follows:</p>
                <sec id="s2-3-1">
                  <title>Implementation of the intervention</title>
                  <p>This domain aims to discover what is implemented in practice. We will consider how the CVI Project Intervention Training package is used in each school. We have made suggestions for how schools may wish to implement the intervention (including delivering the presentation at a staff meeting and sharing the resources with class teachers); however, we have not been prescriptive about this. Early discussions with teachers in our advisory groups suggested that individual schools would prefer to find their own ways to implement the intervention pack, and that autonomy over this process would be appreciated. We will assess the quality (fidelity) of the intervention and how much of the intervention (dose) was delivered and to whom (reach). We will also determine whether there have been any adaptations to the intervention and the reason or purpose of these adaptations. Consideration will also be given to the core components of the intervention, and the barriers and facilitators that influence how individual components of the intervention are selected and delivered.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2-3-2">
                  <title>Mechanism of impact/change</title>
                  <p>The PE will consider how the intervention, as delivered by schools, worked. Research questions will provide information and insights into how the participants, schools and parents responded to and interacted with the intervention. Questions will examine changes in the understanding and knowledge of staff about CVI and how this interacted with their implementation of the intervention, along with exploring the barriers and facilitators they experienced to implementation. Questions will also consider if there were any unintended or unexpected consequences or pathways of the intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2-3-3">
                  <title>Programme differentiation and usual practice</title>
                  <p>The research questions in this domain will examine how the intervention differed from usual practice in the intervention schools. Contamination from intervention to control schools is a potential risk, where schools in the control group make changes related to CVI after hearing about the intervention from a school in the intervention arm. We will seek to assess this with exploratory questions about how and why this occurred and the outcome for control schools.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2-3-4">
                  <title>Acceptability of the intervention</title>
                  <p>This domain will consider the interactions of participants, both school staff and parents with the intervention. The effects of acceptability on implementation of the intervention will be explored.</p>
                  <p>We will consider whether acceptability changes across the school year, and how the responses and interactions of staff and parents with the intervention might change the way the intervention is implemented.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2-3-5">
                  <title>Sustainability</title>
                  <p>This domain will consider whether the intervention could become part of normal practice after the feasibility trial was completed. We will assess the fidelity, dose and reach of the intervention and any steps taken to make it sustainable. Where it has not been sustained, or there are no plans to continue with the changes after the trial, we will explore why this is. Barriers and facilitators to sustainability will also be explored.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2-3-6">
                  <title>Context</title>
                  <p>Contextual factors may influence the effectiveness of an intervention both directly and indirectly. These are external factors that can impede or strengthen its implementation or effects (MRC).</p>
                  <p>We will consider how the paediatric ophthalmology clinics respond and interact with the intervention, including the referral pathway from schools to Hospital Eye Service (HES). In addition, this domain will consider the wider contextual factors that could affect the implementation of the intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2-3-7">
                  <title>Trial process</title>
                  <p>Understanding the participants’ responses to and interactions with the trial processes will allow an assessment of how the trial methods might require adjustment or redesign for further work. Understanding the responses of the participants will also provide information about recruitment and continued participation in the trial by both schools, teachers and parents.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>The CVI project is a feasibility cluster-randomised study with a nested PE and health economic assessment. The PE will use both quantitative and qualitative data sources in order to answer our research questions. We anticipate that all schools will contribute data to the PE, allowing for different experiences with the study between intervention and control arms.</p>

                  <p>Each intervention school will complete a brief school-level survey during the intervention period, conducted at the beginning of the qualitative interview. The survey includes six questions about the implementation of the intervention pack including how it was delivered, who delivered it, which components of the intervention pack have been used, who received the training, how many referral letters have been sent out and how many students have been identified for referral. Follow-up questions will include numbers who have received the intervention, which components have been used, numbers of children identified and referred.</p>
                  <p>Teachers’ knowledge of CVI will be assessed before randomisation and at follow-up, using the Bartiméus Centre (Netherlands) Teacher CVI Knowledge Assessment Survey.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> All teachers for years 3–5 in all schools will complete these. The survey is comprised of five statements about knowledge of CVI (eg, ‘I understand the impact of CVI in daily life’) and respondents are asked to rate whether they feel each statement is true for them on a scale of 0–10.</p>

                  <p>One key representative from each school (usually the SENCO or head teacher) will take part in a semistructured interview at baseline following randomisation (after the intervention has been delivered in intervention schools) and at follow-up. The initial interview will cover school ethos, experiences with data collection, trial processes (including randomisation) and any changes during the study period. Additional topics for intervention schools will include responses to the intervention pack, resources implemented, feedback from staff, monitoring and recording of changes.

                  <p>School staff will be invited to take part in a semistructured interview postintervention implementation, to share their experiences of the CVI Project intervention. The interviews will explore reactions to the intervention materials, how they have been used, views and opinions on their use and usefulness, changes to provision, implementation of both universal and targeted strategies and any feedback on the data collection methods used in the trial. Interviews with staff will take place as the intervention is being used at the school.</p>

Interviews will explore their experiences with the data collection, surveys and any thoughts they had about randomisation. Interviews will also cover any changes during the study period and what these can be attributed to and any referral processes and experiences with the paediatric ophthalmology clinics. Any positive, negative or unintended consequences will be discussed.</p>

Photographs of the classrooms at the start and end of the study period will be compared and scored subjectively for the amount of clutter, by observers unaware of the school or time they were taken.

Verbal agreement for child completed measures will also be sought and questionnaires will not be completed by any child who does not wish to do so.

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>We have presented a protocol for a detailed PE of a complex information sharing intervention to improve the mental well-being of primary school children with CVI. Development of an intervention to support children with CVI has been requested by parents,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and we have developed it with their input. This feasibility study will assess whether and how a future trial should establish effectiveness of the intervention with feedback from this PE. We have addressed key domains as per MRC guidance and have developed our PE research questions around these aims. Data gathered will help us to interpret the findings from the trial, but importantly, will help to refine the design, content and delivery of the intervention. We have also included data to improve trial processes and communication between schools and the research team in a future full-scale trial. Given that this is a PE for a feasibility trial, we will not be powered to interpret the primary outcome differences between intervention and control, and the data gathered as part of the PE will be limited in explaining any differences in the main feasibility study outcomes.</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p>Favourable opinion by the University of Bristol faculty ethics committee was obtained on 12 August 2019 (Ref: 89144). We completed recruitment and baseline data collection from participating schools in all areas. We have recruited seven schools to the feasibility trial and completed baseline trial data collection in February 2020. Four schools have been allocated to the intervention arm and three to control. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and school closures, we paused the study from March–September 2020. We have since obtained ethical approval for minor amendments relating to adjustments for a ‘COVID-secure’ restart to the study on 1 September 2020, with an extension to the study period until 30 April 2021. We will describe all COVID-19-related changes to the study in our final results paper, as these relate to the findings of our feasibility study.</p>
