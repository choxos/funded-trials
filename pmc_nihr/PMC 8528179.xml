                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Sex differences in the incidence and outcomes of several cancers are well established. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell dyscrasia accounting for 2% of all new cancer cases in the UK. There is a clear sex disparity in MM incidence, with 57% of cases in males and 43% in females. The mechanisms behind this are not well understood and the impact of sex on patient outcomes has not been thoroughly explored.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods</title>
                  <p>We investigated the association of sex with baseline disease characteristics and outcome in 3894 patients recruited to the phase III UK NCRI Myeloma XI trial, in which treatment exposure to lenalidomide predominated.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Females were significantly more likely to have the molecular lesions t(14;16) and del(17p) and were more likely to meet the cytogenetic classification of high-risk (HiR) or ultra-high-risk disease (UHiR). There was no difference in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between the sexes in the overall population.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Our data suggest that the genetic lesions involved in the initiation and progression of MM may be different between the sexes. Although females were more likely to have the poor prognosis lesions t(14;16) and del(17p), and were more likely to be assessed as having HiR or UHiR disease, this was not associated with reduced PFS or OS. In female patients the trial treatment may have been able to overcome some of the adverse effects of high-risk cytogenetic lesions.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Multiple myeloma (MM) is more common in males compared to females but the reasons behind this are not well understood and the impact of sex on patient outcomes is unclear. This study demonstrates fundamental differences in genetic lesions underlying the biology of MM between males and females. However, we found that progression-free survival and overall survival were the same in both sexes.</p>

              <p id="para0007">Sex differences in the incidence and outcomes of several cancers are now widely established<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells and is the second most common haematological cancer<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>. MM is more common in males than females; in the UK the age-standardised incidence rate of MM is 11.6 per 100,000 per year in males and 7.3 per 100,000 per year in females<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>. The mechanisms driving this difference are poorly understood. In addition, the effect of sex on MM outcome has not been thoroughly explored.</p>
              <p id="para0008">The causes of sex disparities in cancer are not well-understood and multiple factors may be involved. Sex differences may influence cancer susceptibility at the genetic level and the development of cancer may be affected by sex hormones<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. Furthermore, biological differences may affect response to therapeutic agents<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. For example, it has been shown that the clearance, half-life and side effect profiles of many anticancer drugs are different between the sexes<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0009">MM develops from plasma cell clones that have accumulated a series of genetic lesions leading to a survival advantage<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>. In approximately half of patients the initiating genetic event is hyperdiploidy, characterised by trisomies of chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19 and 21<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>. The remaining half of patients usually have translocations affecting the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (<italic>IGH</italic>) on 14q32 and a partner chromosome (frequently chromosomes 4, 6, 11, 16 or 20)<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>. The translocation event brings a partner oncogene under the influence of the <italic>IGH</italic> promoter/enhancer region which leads to upregulation of oncogene expression<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>.

Both the Myeloma IX and Myeloma XI analyses suggest that t(14;16) is significantly more common in females. In Myeloma IX, t(14;16) was present in 1.6% (10/644) of males and 5.7% (23/402) of females (p &lt; 0.001), and in Myeloma XI it was present in 1.8% (17/962) of males and 4.2% (27/648) of females (p = 0.0038). We have therefore validated the t(14;16) translocation as a more common primary genetic event in females as compared to males. In Myeloma XI, del(17p) was found in 10.6% (69/648) of females and 7.4% of males (71/962), which was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.023). This difference had not been previously identified in the Myeloma IX data, with the lesion present in 7.6% of females (30/396) and 8.9% of males (55/618) (p = 0.489). This may be due to the higher numbers of patients in Myeloma XI, giving us more power to identify disparities. In the Myeloma XI data we did not find any difference between the sexes in the incidence of t(4;14) or gain(1q), both of which had been seen in Myeloma IX.</p>
              <p id="para0024">Sex differences in outcomes and the presence of various cytogenetic lesions have also been explored in other haematological malignancies. For example, in childhood and young-adult cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), females have a significant survival advantage after controlling for other prognostic factors, HR 1.09 (95% CI, 1.00-1.18)<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>. This advantage was most clearly seen in patients aged 20-24 years, Caucasians, and AML subtypes AML-inv(16), acute promyelocytic leukaemia (which is characterised by t(15;17)), and acute erythroid leukaemia<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>. It has also been shown that there is sex disparity in the occurrence of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.5<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>. One study used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to look for differences in genetic changes between the sexes in CLL and found that trisomy 12 and deletions of 11q22.3, 13q14.3, and 17p13.1 were more common in males. The team hypothesized that interactions between the autosomal abnormalities and sex chromosomes may provide the genetic basis for the excess of CLL cases in males<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>. However, as in MM, the biological processes driving these differences are still unclear.</p>
              <p id="para0025"><italic>IGH</italic> translocations in MM have been shown to result from at least 5 different mechanisms including class switch recombination (CSR), homologous recombination, somatic hypermutation, aberrant V(D)J rearrangement, and receptor revision<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>. The t(14;16) translocation is most frequently caused by CSR<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>. CSR is the process by which proliferating IgM-positive B cells rearrange the constant region genes in the <italic>IGH</italic> locus to switch from expressing IgM to IgG, IgE, or IgA, thereby producing an antibody with different effector properties but the same antigen specificity<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. CSR is a multistep process that relies on the expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. AID functions by deaminating cytidine which, coupled with base-excision repair or mismatch repair machinery, leads to the creation of mutations<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>. Interestingly, AID expression may be affected by sex hormones; oestrogen and progesterone have been associated with the modulation of AID expression in murine splenic B cells activated to undergo CSR<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. When bound by oestrogen, the oestrogen-receptor induces AID transcription both directly, by binding and activating the AID promoter, and also indirectly, by binding and activating the <italic>HoxC4</italic> gene<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. In contrast, the progesterone-bound progesterone receptor may inhibit AID transcription by binding upstream of the promoter<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. Therefore, the regulation of AID by hormonal factors could possibly affect CSR mechanisms and perhaps form part of the explanation of sex disparities in certain translocations in MM.</p>
              <p id="para0026">In Myeloma IX, female sex was associated with inferior OS (median 49.9 months in males vs 44.8 months in females, p = 0.020) and no significant difference in PFS. In Myeloma XI there was no difference in PFS or OS and therefore we have not validated any difference in outcome. We hypothesized that this may have been due to the different therapy given in the Myeloma XI trial; however, there was no OS difference between the sexes in the Myeloma XI data for the CTD induction cohort and this regime was received by half of the patients in Myeloma IX. Other studies have identified either no difference in outcomes between the sexes<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> or a worse outcome for male patients<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>. Posch et al performed a single-center study looking at sex-specific aspects in 191 patients with MM undergoing ASCT and found no difference in prognosis<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>. In contrast, in an analysis of ~3000 patients from 9 different clinical trials, males had a worse OS (HR for females 0.83, 95% CI, 0.75-0.91) and interstingly sex distribution was significantly different among different ethnic subgroups; 67.1% of Hispanics were male, 59.6% of non-Hispanic Whites, 51.8% of non-Hispanic African-Americans, and 45.4.% of non-Hispanic others (p = 0.002)<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>. In addition, a recent study by Derman et al explored outcomes by sex using two large population-based data sets (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data set and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass data set) and found that OS and PFS were improved for females. However, these patients did not have uniform treatment<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0027">Molecular risk stratifiers remained prognostic within both the male and female cohorts and there was a trend toward improved outcomes for females vs males within patients with t(14;16) and UHiR disease (but this did not reach statistical significance). The reasons behind the difference in OS sex disparity between the two analyses are unclear but could be related to a number of factors. For example, supportive care has changed in the period between the trials (Myeloma IX recruited 2003-2007, Myeloma XI recruited 2011-2017) and this could have affected males and females differently.</p>
              <p id="para0028">In conclusion, females were more likely to have the cytogenetic risk lesions t(14;16) and del(17p) and more HiR and UHiR disease. This was not associated with reduced PFS and OS, and therefore treatment in the context of the Myeloma XI trial might have been able to overcome some of the adverse effects of the risk lesions present.</p>
