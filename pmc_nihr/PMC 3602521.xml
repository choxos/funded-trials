                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Heterologous prime boost immunization with chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and Modified vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccines is a strategy recently shown to be capable of inducing strong cell mediated responses against several antigens from the malaria parasite. ChAd63-MVA expressing the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> pre-erythrocytic antigen ME-TRAP (multiple epitope string with thrombospondin-related adhesion protein) is a leading malaria vaccine candidate, capable of inducing sterile protection in malaria naïve adults following controlled human malaria infection (CHMI).</p>

                  <title>Methodology</title>
                  <p>We conducted two Phase Ib dose escalation clinical trials assessing the safety and immunogenicity of ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP in 46 healthy malaria exposed adults in two African countries with similar malaria transmission patterns.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP was shown to be safe and immunogenic, inducing high-level T cell responses (median &gt;1300 SFU/million PBMC).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP is a safe and highly immunogenic vaccine regimen in adults with prior exposure to malaria. Further clinical trials to assess safety and immunogenicity in children and infants and protective efficacy in the field are now warranted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Malaria caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> remains a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, predominantly in Africa, in spite of the implementation of extensive control measures <xref rid="pone.0057726-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. An effective vaccine remains a key objective if disease transmission and severity is to be substantially reduced <xref rid="pone.0057726-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The most advanced malaria vaccine in development, the protein-adjuvant vaccine RTS,S/AS01 targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of infection <xref rid="pone.0057726-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, is currently in phase III clinical trials and has been shown to confer partial protection over the 12 months following immunization <xref rid="pone.0057726-Agnandji1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Agnandji2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Whilst notable as the most efficacious malaria vaccine to date there remains a considerable need to improve on its limited clinical efficacy <xref rid="pone.0057726-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, either through modifications to the RTS,S vaccine or by developing vaccine strategies that combine multiple antigens or vaccine types <xref rid="pone.0057726-Hill2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Analysis of the immunological correlates of immunity induced by the RTS,S vaccine in both phase IIa sporozoite challenge studies <xref rid="pone.0057726-Stoute1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Stoute2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and a trial in Mozambique <xref rid="pone.0057726-Aponte1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> provide evidence that very high levels of antibodies to circumsporozoite protein (CS) correlate with protection in humans <xref rid="pone.0057726-Greenwood1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, this correlation is relatively weak. It is unlikely that there is a component of direct T cell mediated protection induced by the vaccine as the magnitude of the CD4+ T cell response measured after vaccination is modest (approximately 150 SFU /million PBMCs on ELIspot) and no CD8+ T cells are induced <xref rid="pone.0057726-Lalvani1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Increasing data from animal models, fieldwork and inoculation of volunteers with irradiated sporozoites support an important role for CD8+ T cells in mediating pre-erythrocytic immunity, even in the absence of antibodies <xref rid="pone.0057726-Schwenk1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Whilst pre-clinical studies demonstrate a clear correlation between CD8+ T cells and protection <xref rid="pone.0057726-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057726-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, clinical vaccine studies have been hampered by the limited ability of existing subunit vaccine strategies, namely adjuvanted protein constructs, to induce high enough numbers of antigen specific CD8+ T cells to confer protection <xref rid="pone.0057726-Hill3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The Jenner Institute has been working to develop a T cell inducing pre-erythrocytic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria vaccine using the sporozoite and liver stage antigen ME-TRAP. This antigen contains a fusion protein of multiple epitopes (ME; a string of 20 epitopes, mainly CD8+ T cell epitopes from pre-erythrocytic antigens) and the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> pre-erythrocytic antigen, thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) <xref rid="pone.0057726-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Multiple vectors for this antigen have been clinically tested including DNA, fowl pox (FP) and the orthopox virus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) <xref rid="pone.0057726-Prieur1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057726-Imoukhuede1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Whilst some of these vaccines are capable of inducing partial protection following controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in malaria naive volunteers <xref rid="pone.0057726-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, this did not translate into efficacy in field studies <xref rid="pone.0057726-Bejon3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Bejon4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> likely due to a substantial reduction in T cell immunogenicity observed in malaria exposed vaccinees compared to UK volunteers <xref rid="pone.0057726-Bejon3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Most recently, heterologous prime boost immunization with chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) followed by MVA, both expressing ME-TRAP, has been shown to be the most immunogenic vaccine regimen to date, inducing more than 2000 IFNγ producing T cells post MVA boost in malaria naïve volunteers <xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This translated into significant clinical efficacy following CHMI administered by mosquito bite with both sterile and partial protection observed for multiple vaccinees in a phase IIa trial in the UK in which strong CD8+ T cell responses were induced (<italic>Ewer et al.</italic> submitted).</p>
              <p>The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of malaria vaccines may be affected by the intensity and pattern of local malaria transmission which determine pre-existing natural immunity to malaria and the potential natural ‘boosting’ of the vaccine induced immune responses <xref rid="pone.0057726-Moorthy3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is therefore useful to assess the safety and immunogenicity of candidate vaccines in malaria exposed adults prior to age de-escalation and administration to children and infants, the target population. Here we present the safety and immunogenicity results of two Phase Ib clinical trials of ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP in malaria exposed male adult volunteers, under taken at two sites with similar malaria transmission patterns in West and East Africa. Both studies included a dose escalation of ChAd63 ME-TRAP and one site (Kenya) compared the safety and immunogenicity of MVA ME-TRAP administered by intramuscular and intradermal routes.</p>

                <p>The first trial (Trial A) was conducted at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit field site located within Sukuta Health Centre in Kombo North district of The Gambia, West Africa. Sukuta village has an estimated population of 17,000 (2003 census).

                <p>The second trial (Trial B) was conducted in Vipingo, Kilifi County, Kenya, East Africa. Participants were recruited from the Rea Vipingo Sisal Plantation Estates in Kilifi which has over 1000 employees and a land area of 3,950 hectares.

Vaccines were manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions by the Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility, University of Oxford (ChAd63 ME-TRAP) and IDT Biologika GmbH, Dessau, Germany (MVA ME-TRAP). Briefly, ChAd63 ME-TRAP was grown in suspension HEK293 cells and purified by caesium chloride density-gradient centrifugation. MVA ME-TRAP was generated in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) and purified by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. Each vaccine lot underwent comprehensive quality control analysis to ensure that the purity, identity and integrity of the virus met pre-defined specifications. Vaccine lots were stored at the clinical site in a −70°C freezer and vaccines were temperature monitored when moved.</p>
                <p>The antigen ME-TRAP contains a fusion protein of multiple epitopes (ME) and the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> pre-erythrocytic thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP). The ‘ME’ is a string of 20 epitopes, mainly CD8 T cell epitopes from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> pre-erythrocytic antigens, fused to the thrombospondin-related adhesion protein. The individual cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes which constitute the ‘multiple epitope’ part of ME-TRAP represent six potentially protective target antigens and are included to try to broaden the immune response rate in the vaccinated population. The ME string is fused to the entire sequence of the T9/96 strain of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> TRAP and the ME-TRAP hybrid is a 2398 base-pair insert which encodes for a single polypeptide of 789 amino acids <xref rid="pone.0057726-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>

                <p>No unexpected AEs or SAEs occurred and no volunteers were withdrawn due to AEs. AEs associated with ChAd63 ME-TRAP AEs were all mild in intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057726-g002">Figure 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057726.s002">Table S2</xref>). No clear difference in reactogenicity was noted between participants receiving 1×10<sup>10</sup> vp and 5×10<sup>10</sup> vp ChAd63 ME-TRAP. All AEs resolved without sequelae within 72 hours of immunization. MVA ME-TRAP was more reactogenic than ChAd63 ME-TRAP though still well tolerated with the majority of AEs mild in intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057726-g003">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057726.s002">Table S2</xref>). Whilst systemic reactogenicity of MVA ME-TRAP was unaffected by route of administration, intradermal injection was associated with increased local reactogenicity (namely injection site swelling, warmth, discoloration, blistering and pain) compared to intramuscular administration. All AEs resolved without sequelae. Local AEs post-MVA ME-TRAP resolved between 1 to 15 days post immunization apart from one case of swelling that lasted for 30 days occurring in an individual who received MVA ME-TRAP intradermally (maximum 35 mm of swelling gradually resolving over time, not associated with a sterile abscess). Systemic AEs post-MVA ME-TRAP resolved within 48 hours of immunization. Minor laboratory abnormalities were seen post immunization. However, all were mild, clinically insignificant and resolved fully (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057726.s003">Table S3</xref>). In Trial A, two volunteers were diagnosed and treated for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria by First response® Rapid Diagnostic kits; one volunteer in group 1, 6 months post MVA ME-TRAP and another in group 2, 34 days post MVA ME-TRAP.

Similarly, 2 volunteers in Trial B were diagnosed and treated for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria by blood film, one on day 17 and one on day 139 and were included in the final analyses. These volunteers demonstrated no unusual features of the illness.</p>

                <p>Heterologous prime boost with ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP induced high frequencies of antigen-specific IFNγ-secreting T cells in both trials as measured by ex-vivo IFNγ ELISPOT. Peak IFNγ ELISPOT responses were detected 7 days post MVA ME-TRAP when a positive response (defined as responses above the lower limit of detection and at least double the response measured at Day 0) was detected in 90% and 100% of recipients in Trial A and Trial B respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057726-t006">Table 6</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057726-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

              <p>In these two Phase Ib trials we have shown in healthy, malaria-exposed adult volunteers that a recombinant ChAd63-MVA heterologous prime-boost immunization regimen encoding ME-TRAP is safe as well as very immunogenic for T-cell induction. ChAd63 ME-TRAP demonstrated an excellent safety profile, inducing only a small number of AEs, all of which were mild in intensity. ChAd63 ME-TRAP had a similar reactogenicity profile in our malaria exposed population to that seen in UK volunteers who received comparable doses of ChAd63 ME-TRAP <xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. No clear increase in reactogenicity was noted with the dose escalation of ChAd63, consistent with data from UK volunteers <xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These findings add to the growing evidence that ChAd63 is a safe vector for clinical use <xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Sheehy2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The safety and immunogenicity of intradermally administered MVA ME-TRAP at doses of up to 1.5×10<sup>8</sup> pfu MVA ME-TRAP have previously been assessed in malaria exposed adults <xref rid="pone.0057726-Moorthy2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057726-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our data, presented here show that increasing the dose of MVA ME-TRAP administered intradermally to malaria exposed adults to 2×10<sup>8</sup> pfu is associated with an increase in frequency but not severity of local AEs, causing relatively short-lived injection site pain, discoloration, warmth and swelling (with the exception of one case of moderate injection site swelling lasting 30 days). The increased dose of MVA ME-TRAP did not however translate into an increase in systemic reactogenicity. MVA ME-TRAP administered intramuscularly in our subjects was associated with considerably fewer local AEs than intradermal administration; however, short-lived injection site pain was still reported by 97% of volunteers. This finding was also seen in UK volunteers <xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In agreement with data from previous clinical studies of ChAd63 vectored vaccines,<xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> there was a significant increase in IFNγ responses post MVA boost in groups receiving the higher dose of ChAd63 ME-TRAP (5×10<sup>10</sup> vp). Of note, there was no statistically significant difference in peak immune responses between individuals in Trial B who received MVA ME-TRAP administered intradermally or intramuscularly. Given this finding and the increased frequency of local AEs associated with intradermal administration, future studies in adults will use 2×10<sup>8</sup> pfu MVA ME-TRAP administered intramuscularly.</p>
              <p>Whilst a previous study of vectored malaria vaccines observed a reduction in T-cell immunogenicity in malaria exposed populations compared to UK volunteers <xref rid="pone.0057726-Bejon3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, IFNγ responses in our volunteers receiving 5×10<sup>10</sup> vp ChAd63 ME-TRAP were comparable with Phase Ia data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057726-t006">Table 6</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Further analysis will assess the cellular composition of T-cell responses to assess and quantify mono-functional gamma-interferon-secreting CD8+ T cells as potential markers of vaccine efficacy (<italic>Ewer et al. submitted</italic>). However, importantly the vaccine-induced T cell responses reported here appear to be the most potent reported to date in Africa for any vaccine type. Responses exceeding 1000 SFU /million PBMCs are very difficult to induce with any vaccination strategy and the levels attained here in this first study of ChAd63-MVA in Africa are therefore encouraging for more widespread use of these vaccine vectors.</p>
              <p>Concerns have been raised that pre-existing anti-vector immunity could limit the immunogenicity or compromise safety of adenoviral vectored vaccines in exposed populations<xref rid="pone.0057726-Duerr1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Dudareva1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Low prevalence of serum neutralising antibodies to ChAd63 in the target population <xref rid="pone.0057726-Dudareva1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and the proven potency of ChAd63 in pre-clinical and clinical studies <xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Sheehy2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, including those studied here, make this a promising vector. Further analysis will assess the relationship between baseline anti-ChAd63 antibodies and immunogenicity.</p>
              <p>Chimpanzee adenoviruses were first used as a vaccine in humans in 2007 <xref rid="pone.0057726-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and are now in clinical development for HIV (<italic>Hanke et al unpublished</italic>), Hepatitis C <xref rid="pone.0057726-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, pandemic influenza (<italic>Gilbert et al. unpublished</italic>) as well as for liver-stage and blood-stage malaria <xref rid="pone.0057726-Sheehy1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057726-Sheehy3" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. All of these vaccines will have major target populations in Africa and these initial safety and immunogenicity data from African vaccinees are therefore of interest for many disease areas.</p>
              <p>Future Phase Ib studies will now assess the safety and immunogenicity of ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP in children and infants. If these data are favourable, field efficacy studies will be undertaken in infants to assess whether strong cellular immunity against ME-TRAP can translate into significant efficacy against naturally acquired <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection and disease in the field.</p>
