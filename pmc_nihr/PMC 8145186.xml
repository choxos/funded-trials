                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">AVATAR therapy is a novel intervention targeting distressing auditory verbal hallucinations (henceforth ‘voices’). A digital simulation (avatar) of the voice is created and used in a three-way dialogue between participant, avatar and therapist. To date, therapy has been delivered over 6 sessions, comprising an initial phase, focusing on standing up to a hostile avatar, and a second phase in which the avatar concedes and focus shifts to individualised treatment targets, including beliefs about voices. The first fully powered randomised trial found AVATAR therapy resulted in a rapid and substantial fall in voice frequency and associated distress that was superior to supportive counselling at 12 weeks. The main objective of this AVATAR2 trial is to test the efficacy of two forms of AVATAR therapy in reducing voice-related distress: AVATAR-brief (standardised focus on exposure, assertiveness and self-esteem) and AVATAR-extended (phase 1 mirroring AVATAR-brief augmented by a formulation-driven phase 2). Secondary objectives include the examination of additional voice, wellbeing and mood outcomes, the exploration of mediators and moderators of therapy response, and examining cost-effectiveness of both forms of therapy compared with usual treatment (TAU).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This multi-site parallel group randomised controlled trial will independently randomise 345 individuals to receive AVATAR-brief (6 sessions) plus TAU or AVATAR-extended (12 sessions) plus TAU or TAU alone (1:1:1 allocation). Participants will be people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders who have heard distressing voices for more than 6 months. The primary outcome is the PSYRATS Auditory Hallucinations Distress dimension score at 16 and 28 weeks, conducted by blinded assessors. Statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and data will be analysed using linear mixed models. Mediation and moderation analyses using contemporary causal inference methods will be conducted as secondary analyses. Service costs will be calculated, and cost-effectiveness assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life years accrued.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par48">Voices are the most commonly reported form of auditory hallucinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] heard by as many as 70% of people diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. They are often associated with high levels of distress and can have a profound impact on everyday life, with typical content involving threats, commands, and abusive comments. Voices frequently persist for many years despite optimal pharmacotherapy, and the currently recommended psychological therapy for voices, cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] but only for just over 50% of people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. CBTp also involves delivering a relatively lengthy treatment, which presents significant barriers to access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, there is considerable interest in the development of novel therapies that are informed by CBTp principles, but which are both shorter and capable of being delivered by a wider workforce.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Typically, voices have ascribed ‘characterful’ identities and are experienced as profoundly ‘real’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with three quarters of people who hear voices reporting an associated mental image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Cognitive models of voices highlight the role of beliefs about voices in voice-related distress (notably relating to omnipotence and malevolence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Social rank theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] has been applied to voices with evidence that the inferiority and powerlessness people commonly experience in relation to their voices may mirror key social relationships, which for some include experiences of trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This relational perspective informs psychological approaches to distressing voices that focus on the interpersonal relationship between the voice-hearer and the voice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and seek to understand the voice in the broader context of the person’s life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par50">AVATAR therapy is one such relational approach. A digital representation (avatar) of the person’s main distressing voice is created, informed by a detailed assessment of the voice (including verbatim content, voice characterisation, the nature of voice-hearer relationship and developmental history). Bespoke software transforms the voice of the therapist to match the auditory characteristics of the voice. The person then creates a visual representation of the voice in line with the ascribed identity and character. The two processes are combined to produce the avatar, through which the therapist can interact with the voice-hearer using a console to switch between speaking in the transformed avatar voice and their own voice. AVATAR therapy as delivered to date comprises two phases. In the first phase, (Exposure and Assertiveness) the avatar delivers verbatim voice content (including threats and abuse) and the person practices assertive responding. Over time the avatar becomes less hostile as the person develops increased power and control within the dialogue. This cues a second phase with formulation-driven therapeutic targets, which can include work on beliefs about voices, self-concept and trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par51">Following a proof-of-concept study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we have conducted a fully powered pragmatic, single blind single-centre RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] comparing AVATAR therapy with supportive counselling (SC) delivered over 7 weekly sessions. This showed that AVATAR therapy resulted in a rapid and substantial reduction in the frequency and distress (PSYRATS-AH) and power of voices (BAVQ-R), that was significantly superior to SC at 12 weeks (the primary outcome). The observed differences at 12 weeks were larger than anticipated with a between-group effect size of 0.8 suggesting that it is a more effective therapy for voices than the alternatives currently available. At 24 weeks, the differences between the two arms were no longer statistically significant, although the clinically significant improvements in the AVATAR therapy scores on primary outcome were sustained.</p>
                <p id="Par52">The lack of a treatment as usual (TAU) arm in this study made the absence of difference between the two active treatment groups at 24 weeks hard to interpret. Similarly, attempts to understand the mechanisms of action for AVATAR therapy are more challenging in the context of an active treatment control. With respect to possible factors which may influence treatment response, a recent analysis of in-session ratings (collected only in the AVATAR therapy arm) explored self-reported anxiety and the sense of voice presence (i.e. the extent to which speaking to the avatar was experienced as like talking to the everyday voice). Whilst sense of voice presence remained consistently high across all sessions, there was a significant reduction in anxiety which was driven by a rapid change during sessions 1–3 (phase 1). Notably, improvements in voice frequency and overall severity at follow-up were predicted by an interaction between overall anxiety reduction and sense of voice presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Allied to clinical reports of significant early improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], this raises the question as to whether a consistent phase 1 focus on exposure and assertiveness to a valid representation of the voice might be sufficient for some individuals; for example, where distress is closely linked to fear, anxiety and relational submissiveness. There would be fewer barriers to training and dissemination of a standardised phase one-based AVATAR therapy compared to the extended therapy, potentially facilitating implementation both across the UK and in other settings worldwide where therapists trained in formulation-based psychological therapies are in short supply.</p>
                <p id="Par53">On the other hand, phase 2 of AVATAR therapy targets developmental and maintenance (‘here and now’) processes specific to an individual formulation. The phase 1 focus on anxiety reduction and assertiveness is extended in a way that may be necessary for optimally effective lasting change where distress is associated with other cognitive, emotional and relational processes. Notably, phase 2 targets beliefs about voices (relating to perceived power and malevolent intent) and aims to facilitate a change in the relationship with the voice which is grounded in autobiographical context and personal meaning, e.g. where voices reflect past experiences of disempowerment and social defeat, the dialogues target emotional resolution and updated views of the self. We will examine these key treatment targets (anxiety and beliefs about voice power and malevolence) as mediators of treatment effects.</p>
                <p id="Par54">The more complex and personalised phase 2 dialogue may be particularly relevant for voices that are experienced as characterful social agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], i.e. voices with ascribed attitudes, intentionality, and personality (their own ‘character’). Ward and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] found that one third of individuals in their AVATAR therapy sample reported a highly characterised dominant voice (e.g. voices associated with a family member or identifiable ‘stranger’ with a consistent background and personality). Specifically, these individuals showed increased interaction (time in conversation) with the avatar compared to those with non-complex characterisation (voices with no clear identity or with only ‘one-dimensional’ character, e.g. ‘an angry, punishing spirit’). Whilst this suggests that the degree of voice characterisation can affect engagement in active dialogue, it remains an open question as to whether it might influence treatment outcome. We plan to address this question in the current trial design, randomising to the two forms of therapy plus TAU, AVATAR-Brief (Phase 1 only) or AVATAR-Extended (phase 1 plus phase 2), or to TAU alone, stratifying by baseline level of characterisation. We hypothesise that whether the voice hearer’s main voice is more or less highly characterised influences (moderates) the treatment effect of level of therapy compared to TAU. If so, this would provide important information concerning targeted treatment. Additional exploratory moderation analyses will consider other demographic and clinical factors which might plausibly influence treatment effects. These include attachment and trauma history, given the relational nature of the AVATAR approach, as well as clinical characteristics found to affect engagement in psychological interventions (e.g. negative symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). Our previous work investigated the cost-effectiveness of AVATAR therapy compared to supportive counselling and found favourable results (paper in preparation). This study will enable us to make a more robust estimate of cost-effectiveness.</p>

              <sec id="Sec15">
                <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                <p id="Par74">The previous trial of AVATAR therapy showed it was effective post-treatment at 12 weeks, compared with an active control treatment (supportive counselling) but the lack of a TAU only arm meant that it was difficult to interpret the absence of a difference between the two active treatment groups at 24 weeks. The next stage of treatment evaluation and research therefore calls for a TAU control comparator before wider dissemination.</p>
                <p id="Par75">Additionally, there are questions about the treatment. As described above, AVATAR therapy as delivered in the previous trial comprises two phases. The trial therapists noted that phase 1 in itself was a powerful intervention for a sizeable number of people, which was supported by evidence within the AVATAR therapy arm of significant anxiety reduction during sessions 1–3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, for some people, anxiety reduction alone may be insufficient to produce optimally effective lasting change, and therefore an approach including both phases may be necessary (see the ‘<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Introduction</xref>’ section). This trial will therefore include two treatment arms, AVATAR-brief (6 sessions) and AVATAR-extended (12 sessions), each combined with TAU, to allow an evaluation and comparison of both these approaches with TAU alone, with an additional health economics evaluation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of each approach compared with TAU.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec16">
                <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                <p id="Par76">AVATAR-brief consists of six individual, face-to-face sessions (in addition to an initial clinical assessment session including avatar creation), delivered by trained therapists (with previous experience working in psychosis), assisted by the avatar software described previously. Therapy focuses on the exposure/assertiveness component and will follow detailed session-by-session guidance in a written AVATAR clinical manual. At the end of each interaction with the avatar, the therapist will return to the room and support the participant to answer questions regarding their experience of the interaction (perceived hostility, anxiety, sense of voice presence) presented either on the screen or in a booklet (at therapist’s discretion).</p>
                <p id="Par77">AVATAR-extended consists of twelve individual, face-to-face sessions (in addition to the initial assessment and avatar creation session), delivered by trained therapists, assisted by the AVATAR therapy software described previously. It includes both phases of treatment as described earlier and detailed in the AVATAR clinical manual. The participants will also complete the same questions at the end of each interaction with the avatar as described above. In line with the clinical manual, the number of sessions for both AVATAR-brief or AVATAR-extended is permitted to vary by no more than two sessions added or removed; any such change will be guided by the clinical judgement of the therapist and in collaboration with the participant.</p>
                <p id="Par78">It is necessary to have access to two private rooms to conduct the therapy; additional equipment includes a laptop (with a webcam and microphone) and secure network, the AVATAR therapy software and the participant must have access to a device on which they can listen to recordings of the sessions (this will be provided by the study team as required). Face-to-face sessions will mostly be conducted at a clinical research facility or local clinical team settings.</p>
                <p id="Par79">Approximately 20 clinicians will be trained to deliver AVATAR therapy during the trial. This will include a core team of 8 trial therapists and clinicians at local NHS sites who will be trained with a view to delivering a smaller number of cases and building therapy and training capacity in the NHS. Training will involve initial orientation to the clinical and technical manuals followed by sessions (face-to-face or remote) focusing on the rationale, therapy targets and delivery of AVATAR-brief and AVATAR-extended. Initial pilot cases will be closely supervised by someone with experience of AVATAR therapy delivery. Training cases will be assessed for treatment fidelity and therapist competence using tools which have been developed for routine monitoring throughout the trial (see the ‘<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</xref>’ section). Therapy supervision during the trial will include individual and group-based supervision delivered from the main site (King’s College London) in addition to individual and peer-based supervision at each local site.</p>

The Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) Short-Form will be used to assess the quality of the therapeutic alliance from the perspective of the participant- this will occur at Session 4 (AVATAR-extended and AVATAR-brief) and repeated in Session 10 (AVATAR-extended only) if therapy delivery changes during the course of intervention (remote or face to face). Therapy process activities (e.g. between session phone contact or messaging and clinical team liaison) will be routinely collected to inform future implementation.</p>

In this case an Adverse Event form would also be completed. It will be made clear to each participant that, should they find any aspect of the research distressing, including the intervention, and/or no longer wish to continue, they will be able to withdraw without this impacting on their usual clinical care in any way.</p>

Each session will be audio recorded with consent. After completion of training, therapist competence will be assessed by an expert in AVATAR therapy for general/clinical and AVATAR-specific skills using ratings adapted from the first AVATAR therapy trial and allowing for differing skill requirements for each level of therapy. Each trial therapist will be rated for competence based on the review of early, mid and late session therapy delivery for at least one completed intervention.

                <p id="Par119">Causal mediation analysis will be based on parametric regression models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. For each mediator separately, this involves estimating a linear model for each mediator with random allocation, baseline outcome, baseline mediator, site and characterisation as covariates, and separately estimating a linear model for each outcome with the mediator, random allocation, baseline outcome, baseline mediator, site and characterisation as covariates. The effect of random allocation on the mediator is multiplied by the effect of mediator on the outcome to estimate the indirect effect, and the effect of random allocation on outcome in the model including mediator is an estimate of the direct effect. The indirect and direct effects sum to the total effect and bootstrapping with 1000 replications will be used to obtain valid standard errors for the causal effects.</p>
                <p id="Par120">For the moderation analyses, these will be conducted by adding interaction terms between random allocation, time and the respective moderators. The difference in treatment effect between unit levels of the moderator can be interpreted as the difference in the estimated treatment effect between a participant with a moderator value at baseline of a+ 1 and a participant with a moderator value at baseline of a.</p>

                <p id="Par122">The main efficacy analysis will be via intention to treat with data from all participants included in the analysis including those who do not complete therapy. Every effort will be made to follow up all participants for research assessments, and the analysis will use, where appropriate, statistical techniques for handling missing data. All models will be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, which allows for missing outcome data under the missing at random assumption; we may also use inverse probability weighting to adjust for non-adherence to allocated treatment and other intermediate outcomes as predictors of future loss to follow-up.</p>

                <p id="Par123">The use of services at baseline, 16 weeks and 28 weeks will be measured with the Client Service Receipt Inventory. Service costs will be calculated by combining these data with appropriate unit cost information (including NHS Reference Costs and figures from the University of Kent). These costs will be added to the costs of the therapy (based on staff time, overheads and activity levels). Costs will be compared between the three arms at 16 and 28 weeks using regression models adjusting for baseline differences. (The 28-week comparison will be of the cumulative costs to that time point.) Bootstrap methods will be used to generate confidence intervals around the cost differences. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be generated using the EQ-5D-5L along with cross-walk method recommended by NICE. We will assume linear change between time points and use area under the curve methods. QALY comparisons will make adjustment for baseline EQ-5D-5L tariffs. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by generating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (in the event of non-dominated arms) and uncertainty addressed using cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves. Missing cost and EQ-5D-5L data will be imputed using multiple imputation methods on 1000 bootstrapped resamples. We will assume that data are missing at random. The imputation will be conducted on each bootstrapped resample in turn and cost-effectiveness estimates made on each.</p>

The research programme development, design and implementation will be managed by the Chief Investigator (CI) and the co-applicants, in consultation with service-user consultants and other expert research collaborators from within and outside of the CI's institution. A dedicated Trial coordinator post will assist in the day-to-day management of the project reporting to the (CI). A trial management committee (TMC) will meet monthly, its membership will include the investigators and the Trial coordinator and site coordinators. It will be chaired by the CI and will manage the day–to-day running of the study and ensure good communication between trial sites, receiving monthly reports from each site on recruitment, therapy completion, adverse events, reviewing progress against milestones and finding solutions to problems as they arise. It will oversee the preparation of reports to the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC).</p>
                <p id="Par126">The Clinical Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will meet at least every 6 months. Its purpose is to provide overall supervision of the trial, approving the protocol and amendments, monitoring adherence to the protocol and providing independent advice on all aspects of the trial. A senior clinical academic, independent of the trial team, will be nominated as the chair. The TSC will include senior clinicians, clinical academics and two service users of mental health services with lived experience of psychosis. The principal investigator (the co-applicant lead at each site), co-applicant investigators, trial coordinator and representatives for each clinical site may join the meetings as observers. The Wellcome Trust may appoint up to two representatives who shall have the right to attend TSC meetings in person, by telephone or by other electronic means as observers.

                  <p id="Par129">The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) will be monitored actively and systematically, following guidance from the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) with the extension for social and psychological interventions, and the extension for reporting of harms. Medical Research Council Guidelines for Good Practice in Clinical Trials will also be followed to ensure good governance of the trial for integrity and participants’ safety and wellbeing.</p>
                  <p id="Par130">AEs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs in service user/patient participants, whether or not related to the therapy or device which require additional support or input from health professionals.</p>
                  <p id="Par131">Adverse events will be initially assessed at three levels of intensity: mild, moderate and severe, which reflect the impact of the event on the person at the time. Please note there is a distinction between ‘severe’ and ‘serious’. Seriousness is the criteria for defining regulatory reporting obligations and the following will be considered as serious adverse events (SAE, categories A–C): All deaths (category A), incidents which acutely jeopardise the health or psychological wellbeing of the individual, resulting in immediate hospital admission and/or permanent disability (category B), or resulting in injury requiring immediate medical attention (category C). These SAEs will include but are not limited to (1) hospital admissions; (2) home treatment team involvement; (3) suicide attempts; (4) any violent incident necessitating police involvement (whether victim or accused); (5) self-harming behaviour; and (6) all deaths. In order to ensure active surveillance of harms, at each assessment point, research workers will utilise the interview to actively check for the occurrence of specific AEs. At the completion of the trial, all medical notes will be checked, for the total duration of enrolment, for any previously undisclosed record of AEs. Reasons for withdrawal from the study will also be recorded.</p>
                  <p id="Par132">The chair of the DMEC will determine relatedness of the event to the research assessment, therapy or device based on a temporal relationship, and consideration of whether there were insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the AVATAR software. An adverse event may also be device-related if it was the result of user error or intentional misuse of AVATAR therapy software. The DMEC chair will confirm whether the event is unexpected or unexplained given the participant’s clinical course, previous conditions and history, and concomitant treatments. As detailed in the risk analysis conducted for the CE-marking of AVATAR therapy software, we do not anticipate any serious adverse device effects. We do not anticipate any serious therapy or assessment-related adverse events; this expectation is based on the safety data from the previous AVATAR trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par133">All SAEs will be reported immediately to the Chief Investigator and Principal Investigators (for the relevant site) and the independent chair of the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC). At each meeting of the DMEC, or at any time at the request of the DMEC Chair, a full report of AEs will be reviewed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par138">AVATAR therapy is a relational therapy for distressing voices involving direct dialogue with a digital representation of the main voice the person hears. Encouraging pilot work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] led to a fully powered RCT in which AVATAR Therapy was found to be superior to an active control post-therapy with a large effect size of 0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Delivery of AVATAR Therapy in this recent trial resulted in an evolution in our understanding of the core therapy processes and how these might, in principle, differ between a standardised phase 1 focusing on exposure and assertiveness, and a formulation-driven phase 2 incorporating a broader range of treatment targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Data from the previous trial suggest that anxiety reduction is especially prominent during phase 1, but that other processes during phase 2, including changes in the perceived omnipotence and malevolence of the voice, may contribute to improved treatment outcomes, at least for some participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The new trial develops these insights and aims to make progress towards increased availability of AVATAR therapy in routine mental health care. In addition to testing efficacy of AVATAR-brief and AVATAR-extended, our examination of mediation will also provide understanding of the mechanisms of therapeutic change. The trial will also provide important information on whether, if the therapy is shown to be effective, this is influenced by the complexity of characterisation of the voice. Other clinical characteristics which might plausibly influence AVATAR treatment effectiveness (e.g. trauma experiences and negative symptoms) will be included in exploratory moderation analyses. In AVATAR2 we will harness the ecological validity of ESM to capture changes in anxiety and the relationship with the voice in daily life at each time-point. Finally, the incremental cost-effectiveness of both AVATAR-brief and AVATAR-extended compared to TAU will also inform future strategies for therapist training and wider provision.</p>
              <p id="Par139">The trial will also allow testing of the AVATAR software platform across multiple sites with participants and therapists recruited from several NHS settings serving both urban and rural populations. It is likely that a proportion of participants will be recruited, assessed and indeed receive therapy remotely. At the time of writing this protocol, the UK is experiencing a second surge in COVID-19 cases. As a result, many clinical services have reduced face-to-face contact for all but urgent purposes and a range of social distancing and other restrictions are periodically imposed in localities or UK nations. Recruitment strategies including meetings with clinicians will be carried out virtually, as required, as will procedures for obtaining consent and data capture. Previously, AVATAR therapy was delivered in clinic settings and although the therapist conducted the dialogue from a separate room, he/she was nevertheless available in person at any point during the therapy. Although remote delivery of therapy is now technically feasible, there are anticipated to be challenges in terms of recruitment and the practical feasibility of delivering sessions increasing the importance of careful monitoring of treatment adherence and fidelity. Whilst we have the technology to deliver therapy via a secure, encrypted system and we can supply the necessary hardware to participants, the extensive geography of the new trial may bring challenges of connectivity and other in-session technical difficulties. The fact that the therapist is not immediately on hand may also be a barrier to recruitment or continued participation especially in the anxiety-provoking early sessions and brief therapy. Communication with the participant’s usual clinical team may also be delayed. Given these potential challenges, detailed standard operating procedures for remote recruitment, assessment and therapy delivery have been developed, the latter informed by recent evidence of successful remote delivery of psychological therapy including trauma-focused work which shares AVATAR therapy’s approach to working in the context of high affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We anticipate the possibility of conducting sub-analyses that take account of whether data collection and/or therapy were delivered remotely and of the wider covid-19 context.</p>
              <p id="Par140">AVATAR therapy is multifaceted and therapy delivery requires skill, sensitivity, and effective training and supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therapists on the previous trial were four doctoral-level psychologists and one senior consultant psychiatrist, all experienced clinicians with prior expertise in working within a cognitive-behavioural therapy approach for psychosis. The majority of the therapy-specific interventions were developed and refined in the earlier trial. Whilst interest in the approach is growing; for example, with independent pilot work conducted by other research groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], the small number of therapists who have delivered AVATAR therapy as pioneered by Julian Leff and developed within our team remains a significant barrier to wider dissemination. The present study extends training to approximately 20 clinicians across at least 8 NHS settings with planned assessments of fidelity and competence in delivering the therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par141">The findings of this trial will provide further data on efficacy and cost-effectiveness across multiple clinical settings, and lead to the optimisation and increased personalisation of the AVATAR therapy approach. This will pave the way, should the findings be positive, to wider therapy training and implementation in the future.</p>
