                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The simple ultrasound activity score for Crohnâ€™s disease (SUS-CD) and bowel ultrasound score (BUSS) are promising intestinal ultrasound (IUS) indices of CD, but studied mainly in small settings with few sonographers. We compared SUS-CD and BUSS against histological and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) reference standards in a post hoc analysis of a prospective multicentre, multireader trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Participants recruited to the METRIC trial (ISRCTN03982913) were studied, including those with available terminal ileal (TI) biopsies. Sensitivity and specificity of SUS-CD and BUSS for TI CD activity were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI), from the prospective observations of the original METRIC trial sonographers against the histological activity index (HAI) and the simplified magnetic resonance index of activity (sMARIA).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">We included 284 patients (median 31.5 years, IQR 23â€“46) from 8 centres, who underwent IUS and MRE. Of these, 111 patients had available terminal ileal biopsies with HAI scoring. Against histology, sensitivity and specificity for active disease were 79% (95% CI 69â€“86%) and 50% (31â€“69%) for SUS-CD, and 66% (56â€“75%) and 68% (47â€“84%) for BUSS, respectively. Compared to sMARIA, the sensitivity and specificity for active CD were 81% (74â€“86%) and 75% (66â€“83%) for SUS-CD, and 68% (61â€“74%) and 85% (76â€“91%) for BUSS, respectively. The sensitivity of SUS-CD was significantly greater than that of BUSS against HAI and sMARIA (<italic>pÂ </italic>&lt; 0.001), but its specificity was significantly lower than of BUSS against the MRE reference standard (<italic>pÂ </italic>= 0.003).</p>

              <p id="Par16">Identifying and treating inflammatory activity in Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) are fundamental to optimise management and reduce subsequent penetrating and stricturing disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cross-sectional imaging including magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is used routinely to diagnose and monitor CD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and they are viable alternatives to colonoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. IUS has several advantages over MRE, being rapid in both bedside and outpatient settings, inexpensive, better tolerated by patients and avoiding contrast administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There has been considerable interest in developing and validating sonographic scores that quantify disease activity, in the hope that more systematic interpretation will improve consistency, aid comparison between consecutive examinations and facilitate response assessment. A range of US activity scores are proposed, including the simple ultrasound score for Crohnâ€™s disease (SUS-CD) and bowel ultrasound score (BUSS), which have both been developed recently using robust methodology, and perform well against colonoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">To date, these promising indices have been derived and initially evaluated in single- or dual-centre studies using few, highly specialised sonographers, so their performance characteristics in generalised practice are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Whilst mucosal assessments with endoscopic or histological scoring are frequently used as a reference standard for disease activity, they can neglect transmural disease, something captured by cross-sectional imaging. Accordingly, we evaluated the accuracy of SUS-CD and BUSS to identify terminal ileal CD activity using both histopathological and magnetic resonance reference standards, obtained as part of a prospective, multicentre, multireader diagnostic accuracy trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study population and design</title>
                <p id="Par18">The MR Enterography or Ultrasound in Crohnâ€™s disease (METRIC) trial (Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN03982913) was a prospective multicentre diagnostic accuracy study comparing MRE and IUS in adult CD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients with newly diagnosed or established CD suspected of relapse were recruited from eight UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals, and underwent IUS and MRE, as well as any other investigations such as endoscopy, required for standard care. The SUS-CD and BUSS were described after the METRIC trial completion; thus, the present study is a post hoc analysis rather than a pre-specified secondary outcome of the METRIC trial.</p>
                <p id="Par19">For the current study, we considered all patients (both newly diagnosed and suspected relapse) recruited to the METRIC trial for the comparison of IUS against a MRE standard of reference. This included some patients with a terminal ileal biopsy sample (with histological activity scoring), available within 4 weeks of IUS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), for the comparison of IUS against a histological standard of reference. This cohort has been described previously in a study investigating the diagnostic performance of MRE activity scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but this prior report did not consider ultrasound activity scores (SUS-CD and BUSS), nor did it utilise an additional MRE reference standard. We reported results using the QUADAS-2 reporting guidelines for validation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="330_2023_9958_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>IUS protocol</title>
                <p id="Par20">IUS was performed prospectively and according to local protocols, using standard imaging platforms, curvilinear (2 â€“ 5 MHz) and linear (&gt; 5 MHz) probes, without oral or intravenous contrast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients fasted for 4 h prior to the IUS study. The colour Doppler setting was 6â€“9 m/s. Radiologists performing IUS were Fellows of the Royal College of Radiologists, affiliated to the British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (BSGAR), and had a minimum of 1 year subspeciality training in gastrointestinal radiology. One sonographer performed IUS who had received formal training and performed IUS routinely in clinical practice. The operators performing IUS had a median of 8 years (IQR 4â€“11) of experience. All practitioners were blinded to clinical data, previous imaging studies and endoscopic findings, and prospectively completed a standardised clinical report form (CRF), documenting conventional IUS observations (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Data from these prospectively completed CRFs were used by the study coordinator (radiologist with 5 years experience of MRE and IUS) to retrospectively derive the SUS-CD and BUSS activity scores without re-reviewing images.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par39">In the present study, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of two IUS scoring indices for terminal ileal CD, using prospective data collected as part of a multicentre trial. SUS-CD and BUSS at the previously published thresholds had adequate sensitivity compared to both the histological and magnetic resonance reference standards. Compared to histology, the sensitivity of SUS-CD was significantly greater than that of BUSS. There was no significant difference in specificity. The sensitivity of SUS-CD was also significantly greater than that of BUSS when using the MRE reference standard, but its specificity was significantly lower than of BUSS. The specificity of both indices was numerically higher when the MRE reference standard was adopted.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Like MRE, IUS is an important investigation for CD that influences clinical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Development of IUS activity scores has attracted considerable interest as objective and standardised assessment may increase diagnostic utility across both clinical and research settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Saevik and co-workers developed SUS-CD in a single-centre prospective study of 40 patients using the simple endoscopic score for CD (SES-CD) as the reference standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The score was then validated in a dual-centre study, using the same reference standard, in 124 patients with two sonographers performing IUS. Sensitivity for SUS-CD was 95.3% (95% CI 88, 98), specificity 70.3% (56, 82) and ROC AUC 0.92. In our more diverse, multi-institution trial, with numerous sonographers, we found SUS-CD to be sensitive for active TI CD. Specificity was adequate using the MRE reference standard, although lower when compared to histology. Freitas et al tested SUS-CD in a retrospective single-centre study of 50 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The reference standard was SES-CD, and a solitary, highly experienced sonographer performed all IUS. They found SUS-CD had an ROC AUC of 0.62 for discriminating between inactive and active CD; sensitivity and specificity were not reported, and the 2 Ã— 2 tables not provided. In their cohort, 40% of their patients had no TI disease. The small, retrospective, single-centre nature of this work limits generalisability.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Allocca et al developed BUSS in a single-centre prospective study of 225 patients, all with an established diagnosis of CD receiving stable treatment, who were undergoing routine assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One of two sonographers, with at least 7 years experience, performed IUS. The reference standard was SES-CD. Sensitivity and specificity were 83% (76, 88) and 85% (73, 93), respectively, with a ROC AUC of 0.86 (0.81, 0.91). The same group also assessed BUSS in a prospective study of 49 patients who underwent IUS and colonoscopy before and following treatment with biologics and/or immunosuppressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These patients all had an established diagnosis of CD for at least 6 months. SES-CD was the reference standard and IUS was again undertaken by two sonographers with at least 7 years experience. BUSS had a sensitivity of 90% (55 to 99) and specificity of 74% (58 to 87) for identifying patients with endoscopic remission. In our more diverse multi-centre, multireader study population, we found BUSS to have adequate sensitivity compared to both reference standards. Specificity was similarly highly compared to the MRE reference standard.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Indeed, in our study, the specificity for both IUS indices was numerically higher when MRE was taken as the reference standard. This may reflect the inherent limitation of a histopathological reference standard which provides superficial sampling of the TI rather than the transmural bowel assessment offered by MRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, in instances of endoscopic skipping, where the luminal surface of the TI is spared because the active inflammation is restricted to intramural portions of the bowel wall, endoscopy may be falsely negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, when compared to the same histological reference, MRE activity scores sMARIA, London score and the â€˜extendedâ€™ London score also had relatively low specificity of 41%, 64% and 41% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par43">An advantage of histology as a reference standard is that it is independent of the imaging test under consideration. Although MRE is arguably a superior â€˜transmuralâ€™ reference standard, it shares parameters with IUS. Wall thickness for example is common to both MRE and IUS activity scores, and it is therefore perhaps expected that IUS would fare better against an MRE standard of reference. It would be interesting to fully detail the characteristics of patients who have active disease on IUS (or MRE) but not on histology and vice versa, and how this is influenced by patient cohort (new diagnosis or suspect relapse). Although beyond the scope of the current study, such an analysis is planned.</p>
              <p id="Par44">The development and validation studies for SUS-CD and BUSS occurred in single centres with few sonographers, who were also highly specialised. Indeed, a recent international Delphi consensus panel concluded that it was uncertain if any current IUS scoring systems were appropriate to assess CD activity, highlighting the need for more studies like ours for external validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The present study is the first to evaluate the performance of these IUS indices in a prospective, multicentre, multireader setting. We considered 284 patients from 8 institutions with 19 operators performing IUS, thus more representative of a real-world setting and likely to reflect expected performance in clinical practice. This is the first study to assess SUS-CD and BUSS against an MRE reference standard, which is important as in the clinical setting, a decision often needs to be made between whether to employ IUS or MRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, MRE is both sensitive and specific for CD providing transmural assessment, and in cases of endoscopic skipping, a reliable alternative to endoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">Our work has some limitations. The METRIC trial was completed prior to the development of the SUS-CD and BUSS and so this work is a pragmatic post hoc analysis. In our study, we scored the colour Doppler score component of SUS-CD based on whether the increased flow was focal (less than half the circumference of diseased bowel compared to normal bowel wall of the same patient) or generalised (more than half the circumference of abnormal bowel wall), rather than the exact number of vessels observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We also used the original suggested cut-off for active disease. We feel that our methodology is very close to that described for SUS-CD, and that there would have been little to no difference in our estimation of the colour Doppler component. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that this variation in methodology impacted on results, so future work validating SUS-CD should adopt the exact approach described in the original paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Notwithstanding, if IUS activity scores are to ultimately be used in routine clinical practice, it is more likely that the colour Doppler parameter will be assessed in a qualitative fashion to save time. This is reflected in recent IUS scores such as the International Bowel Ultrasound Segmental Activity Score (IBUS-SAS) which advocates a qualitative rather than quantitative approach to the assessment of Doppler signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We did not encounter this issue when deriving BUSS as increased bowel wall flow was a binary score. IUS was performed according to protocol-stipulated parameters, including probe frequency and Doppler flow settings. However, the trial utilised many readers and a range of ultrasound platforms. It is possible that results could have been improved using stricter acquisition protocols, a single manufacturer platform and central reading. However, one of the advantages of the METRIC trial design is that it tested the generalisability of imaging modalities when applied across multiple healthcare settings, reflecting real-world clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We could not use other reference standards, including ileocolonoscopy scores such as SES-CD to evaluate diagnostic accuracy, as these were not collected as part of METRIC. We were unable to assess inter-observer agreement but this has been studied extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Reassuringly, De Voogd et al found bowel wall thickness and Doppler flow were reliable, parameters that comprise SUS-CD and BUSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our cohort consisted of TI CD exclusively, so we could not evaluate IUS scoring systems for other segments including colonic disease. Our study design did not permit us to consider whether SUS-CD and BUSS are sensitive to treatment response. BUSS has been shown to identify therapeutic response, but more work is needed in this area, especially to evaluate SUS-CD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We could not assess other promising IUS activity scores such as the IBUS-SAS as the data required to calculate these were not collected as part of the METRIC trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Finally, the METRIC cohort had a relatively high prevalence of active disease given the nature of the recruited patients. Our data is therefore potentially more applicable to patients with higher disease activity, rather than those with more chronic disease and lower levels of enteric inflammation.</p>

              <p id="Par46">Our study provides real-world evidence that SUS-CD and BUSS are viable IUS indices that are sensitive and specific for active TI CD, especially when compared to an MRE reference standard.
