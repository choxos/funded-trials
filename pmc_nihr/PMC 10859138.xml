                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>There are scarce data on best practices to control for confounding in observational studies assessing vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19. We compared the performance of three well-established methods [overlap weighting, inverse probability treatment weighting and propensity score (PS) matching] to minimize confounding when comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Subsequently, we conducted a target trial emulation to study the ability of these methods to replicate COVID-19 vaccine trials.</p>

                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We included all individuals aged ≥75 from primary care records from the UK [Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) AURUM], who were not infected with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 as of 4 January 2021. Vaccination status was then defined based on first COVID-19 vaccine dose exposure between 4 January 2021 and 28 January 2021. Lasso regression was used to calculate PS. Location, age, prior observation time, regional vaccination rates, testing effort and COVID-19 incidence rates at index date were forced into the PS. Following PS weighting and matching, the three methods were compared for remaining covariate imbalance and residual confounding. Last, a target trial emulation comparing COVID-19 at 3 and 12 weeks after first vaccine dose vs unvaccinated was conducted.</p>

                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts comprised 583 813 and 332 315 individuals for weighting, respectively, and 459 000 individuals in the matched cohorts. Overlap weighting performed best in terms of minimizing confounding and systematic error. Overlap weighting successfully replicated estimates from clinical trials for vaccine effectiveness for ChAdOx1 (57%) and BNT162b2 (75%) at 12 weeks.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Overlap weighting performed best in our setting. Our results based on overlap weighting replicate previous pivotal trials for the two first COVID-19 vaccines approved in Europe.</p>

              <p>Routinely collected data are widely used to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines<xref rid="dyad138-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1–4</sup></xref> and boosters.<xref rid="dyad138-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyad138-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, careful consideration of how to best account for confounding is required when comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated people: patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19, as well as population-level information such community transmission and local vaccination rates at a time, are among the most important confounders. However, the latter were not always adequately considered in previously conducted vaccine effectiveness studies. Differences in methods for confounding adjustment, choice of study design, inclusion criteria and calendar time can have substantial impact on study findings. Recent observational studies<xref rid="dyad138-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyad138-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> assessing the comparative effectiveness of ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) and BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) reported a 28% decreased risk for infection after vaccination with BNT162b2(8) vs no differences in infection incidence.<xref rid="dyad138-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Another challenge when studying vaccine effectiveness is the handling of the immediate time after the first vaccine dose. Randomized trials<xref rid="dyad138-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyad138-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> showed no protective vaccine effect in the first 2 weeks, with the vaccine-induced immunity still building up. However, whereas some observational studies replicated these findings,<xref rid="dyad138-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> others already observed protective effects in the early days,<xref rid="dyad138-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyad138-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> indicating the presence of residual confounding. Some studies and even trials omitted this vulnerable time from their main analyses<xref rid="dyad138-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and others did not,<xref rid="dyad138-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> which makes it difficult to compare results across studies. Several methods were used in previous studies, but a rigorous assessment of their ability to resolve confounding has not yet been completed.<xref rid="dyad138-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Moreover, studies benchmarking vaccine effectiveness findings from observational studies to the ‘gold standard’ of phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT) are scarce.</p>
              <sec>
                <title>Objectives and manuscript structure</title>
                <p>Our study comprises two overarching objectives. Objective 1 aimed to empirically evaluate the comparative performance of three different methods to minimize confounding in the study of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness: overlap weighting (OW),<xref rid="dyad138-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW)<xref rid="dyad138-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and propensity score (PS) with exact geographical and index date matching.</p>
                <p>We (i) calculated PS, which represent the probability of exposure based on a participant’s baseline characteristics. We used different representations of geographical location, as we deemed this to be a key confounder for our subsequent analyses. After applying weighting and matching techniques, we (ii) compared our methods with respect to (a) remaining confounding based on imbalances between baseline characteristics in vaccinated vs unvaccinated subjects, (b) statistical power based on minimum detectable relative risk and (c) systematic error due to unobserved confounders using control outcomes.</p>

                  <p>From the source population, individuals were classified as vaccinated (VC) or unvaccinated (UV), based on whether they received a first COVID-19 vaccine dose in the period between 4 January 2021 and 28 January 2021, when this age group was eligible and prioritized for vaccination in the UK. We constructed three vaccinated cohorts, namely any vaccination, ChAdOx1 vaccinated, and BNT162b2 vaccinated cohorts. Index date for vaccinated people was their vaccination date. Individuals with a record of both vaccine brands at index date were excluded. Index date for unvaccinated people was either the index date of the matched vaccinated counterpart [for matching] or was randomly assigned following the distribution of index dates in the vaccinated cohort [for weighting] to account for immortal time bias<xref rid="dyad138-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> (<xref rid="dyad138-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, available as <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary data</xref> at <italic toggle="yes">IJE</italic> online).

PS were computed using logistic regression, with three different representations of location included: without location (PS<sub>base</sub>), region (PS<sub>reg</sub>) or de-identified GP surgery (PS<sub>gp</sub>). We used two weighting methods: inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), with trimming over 0.95 and below 0.05 to reduce the impact of extreme weights; and overlap weighting (OW), which down-weights the tails of the PS distribution and emphasizes the population with highest overlap in observed characteristics between treatments.<xref rid="dyad138-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
                  <p>For matching, we used 1:1 PS nearest neighbours matching, combining exact matching for age band, gender and location (region or GP) with caliper matching (width 0.2 standard deviation) for PS (PS<sub>1</sub>). After unvaccinated people were assigned the index date of their matched vaccinated counterpart, PS were computed again on the new index date (PS<sub>2</sub>) to ensure that the matching was still balanced after index date assignment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this large cohort study using UK primary care records, we assessed the effectiveness of a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccines BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 using overlap weighting. Our estimates of vaccine effectiveness are in line with trial estimates for the ChAdOx1 vaccine (57%), as well as the JCVI estimates for BNT162b2 at 12 weeks (75%).</p>
              <p>We chose OW for the target trial emulation, following an extensive investigation of the performance of different methods to account for confounding when studying COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. Notably, merely including individual-level patient characteristics in the PS did not guarantee balance of population-level geographical variables, such as geographical region and GP, regardless of subsequent PS approaches (matching/weighting). Importantly for COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, OW was the best performing method to minimize confounding at the population level, including geographical location, which has important implications due to known differences in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. Additionally, NCOs demonstrated a better resolution of residual confounding with OW compared with other matching and weighting methods. Therefore, the proposed theoretical advantages of OW,<xref rid="dyad138-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyad138-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> including exact balance of measured patient characteristics and good retainment of sample size, were supported by this empirical study.</p>
              <p>Previous early vaccine effectiveness studies using observational data overlooked the adjustment of geographical information.<xref rid="dyad138-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyad138-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Our study, consistent with previous methodological literature, showed that geographical distributions between the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were markedly different,<xref rid="dyad138-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> emphasizing the need for adjustment. In addition, the insufficient covariate balance after applying conventional methods highlighted the importance of the proposed diagnostics in observational studies of vaccine effectiveness. More importantly, our findings did not support the previous suspicion that less active health-seeking behaviour in unvaccinated people might confound the vaccine effectiveness observed in real-world data,<xref rid="dyad138-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> as no association was found between vaccination and PCR testing in our study after empirical calibration. Besides, more unvaccinated people were tested in the first 10 days compared with people vaccinated with BNT162b2. The observed protective vaccine effects shortly after vaccination were in line with previous findings from observational data,<xref rid="dyad138-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyad138-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> which might be attributable to differences in personal behaviour during the period immediately before and after vaccination, e.g. mask wearing, avoiding crowded indoor places/shielding, rescheduling vaccination if feeling unwell, which unfortunately was unlikely to be captured by electronic health records. These protective effects might partly explain why our trial emulation did not show coverage for BNT162b2 at 3 weeks, but found higher vaccine effectiveness compared with RCT. Differences in target population, community transmission over time, and geographical location might have contributed to this.</p>
              <p>Previous studies found little evidence for relevant heterogeneity of vaccine effectiveness with respect to age, but a high variability in vaccine response for variants.<xref rid="dyad138-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyad138-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Moreover, community transmission, social distancing rules and herd immunity affected risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We therefore opted to conduct our trial emulation study among those people who were prioritized for vaccination in the community (people aged ≥75), allowing for the shortest difference in calendar time to when pivotal RCTs were conducted. This allowed us to emulate as much as possible the conditions when these RCTs were conducted, including predominant variant, herd immunity status in the population and the presence and/or intensity of non-pharmacological interventions.</p>
              <p>We acknowledge the following limitations. Whereas testing for COVID-19 was widely available during our study period, it was reserved for hospitalized patients in the early days of the pandemic. Therefore, people might have had COVID-19 but were not diagnosed or tested. Although we excluded the first COVID-19 wave from our study period and used two different definitions to define COVID-19 as our outcome, some degree of misclassification cannot be ruled out. In addition, our study population deviated from the population included in clinical trials, particularly with respect to age. Differences in outcome definition, i.e. symptomatic COVID-19 assessed in the trials vs positive test s/clinical diagnoses in our study, are being acknowledged.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our study found a first vaccine dose against COVID-19 associated with a 69% reduced risk of COVID-19 for both the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines. These data confirm the estimation by JCVI that one dose of BNT162b2 provides protection beyond the 3-week period studied in pivotal trials. Second, we demonstrate that PS-based overlap weighting can replicate pivotal trials and therefore provide reliable estimates of vaccine effectiveness. Further, overlap weights performed better than IPTW or matching in controlling for measured and unmeasured covariates while retaining sample size in our setting, and could be proposed as the preferred method for future vaccine effectiveness studies. Finally, our findings illustrate the need to incorporate patient location (e.g. GP practice or region of residence) and related variables (e.g. testing and transmission rates) to minimize community- as well as patient-level confounding in the study of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.</p>
