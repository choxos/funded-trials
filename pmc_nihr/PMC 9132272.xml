                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an invariably lethal progressive disease, causing degeneration of neurons and muscle. No current treatment halts or reverses disease advance. This single arm, open label, clinical trial in patients with ALS investigated the safety and tolerability of a novel modified low molecular weight dextran sulphate (LMW-DS, named ILB<sup>®</sup>) previously proven safe for use in healthy volunteers and shown to exert potent neurotrophic effects in pre-clinical studies. Secondary endpoints relate to efficacy and exploratory biomarkers.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Thirteen patients with ALS were treated with 5 weekly subcutaneous injections of ILB<sup>®</sup>. Safety and efficacy outcome measures were recorded weekly during treatment and at regular intervals for a further 70 days. Functional and laboratory biomarkers were assessed before, during and after treatment.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>No deaths, serious adverse events or participant withdrawals occurred during or after ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment and no significant drug-related changes in blood safety markers were evident, demonstrating safety and tolerability of the drug in this cohort of patients with ALS. The PK of ILB<sup>®</sup> in patients with ALS was similar to that seen in healthy controls. The ILB<sup>®</sup> injection elicited a transient elevation of plasma Hepatocyte Growth Factor, a neurotrophic and myogenic growth factor. Following the ILB<sup>®</sup> injections patients reported increased vitality, decreased spasticity and increased mobility. The ALSFRS-R rating improved from 36.31 ± 6.66 to 38.77 ± 6.44 and the Norris rating also improved from 70.61 ± 13.91 to 77.85 ± 14.24 by Day 36. The improvement of functions was associated with a decrease in muscle atrophy biomarkers. These therapeutic benefits decreased 3–4 weeks after the last dosage.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This pilot clinical study demonstrates safety and tolerability of ILB<sup>®</sup> in patients with ALS. The exploratory biomarker and functional measures must be cautiously interpreted but suggest clinical benefit and have a bearing on the mechanism of action of ILB<sup>®</sup>. The results support the drug’s potential as the first disease modifying treatment for patients with ALS.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>ALS is a degenerative disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons in brain, brain stem and spinal cord. The major clinical signs of ALS are weakness and atrophy of voluntary muscles, increased muscular tone with increasing spasticity or flaccid paresis, decreased fine motor skills, as well as increasing difficulties of swallowing, speech and respiration. The incidence varies between 1–3 per 100,000 persons, giving rise to a prevalence of between 4–12 per 100,000 persons [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. About 10% of affected people have familial ALS with genetic causes, while 90% have sporadic ALS. Genetics and variable risk factors partly influence the rate of progression of ALS [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For most subjects, the disease is relentlessly progressive, and death usually occurs because of respiratory insufficiency or pneumonia within 2–5 years of diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. No effective cure exists, and currently approved drugs have only marginal effects, even in the most affected persons.</p>
              <p>Neuronal degeneration occurs in ALS, with an increase of neurofilaments (NfL) and other remnants of degenerated neurons measurable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The degeneration and inflammation seen in the central nervous system (CNS) is reflected by an increase of immunoglobulins, complement and other inflammatory biomarkers in serum, plasma and CSF [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as well as reactive cellular changes in astrocytes and microglia. Besides neuroinflammation, glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress are thought to contribute to the neural cell dysfunction and death [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As in other degenerative processes, there is activation of the ubiquitine-proteasome system, used for degrading many of the cellular remains of proteins or peptides that are released from damaged CNS and muscle cells into tissue fluids [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Accordingly, CSF, serum and plasma biomarkers can be used to monitor the degenerative and inflammatory progress of the disease and the possible effects of drug treatment [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>The low molecular weight dextran sulphate (LMW-DS, ILB<sup>®</sup>) used in this study (Tikomed AB, Viken, Sweden) is a novel patented formulation of a modified glycosaminoglycan that exerts specific neurotrophic and myogenic effects. Although a limited number of animal studies in neurological disease models have been carried out to date with ILB<sup>®</sup>, its pre-clinical safety profile is well established and the drug has been shown to restore brain energy metabolism in the injured brain after severe traumatic brain injury in rats [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Subcutaneously injected ILB<sup>®</sup> induces a rapid release of pharmacologically relevant levels of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) into the circulation in animals and healthy human volunteers [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which may provide a key neurotrophic stimulus to the disease-compromised CNS as well as a myogenic stimulus to degenerating muscle [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Of direct relevance, clinical trials of intra-thecal HGF for the treatment of ALS are currently in progress [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We hypothesise that ILB<sup>®</sup> can be safely administered to patients with ALS where it will be well tolerated and might be effective at treating the consequences of progressive neurodegeneration and muscular atrophy.</p>

                <p>The clinical trial was a Phase IIa, single-centre, open label, single-arm proof of concept study of a small number of patients, where the primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of subcutaneously administered ILB<sup>®</sup>. To assess possible efficacy in patients with ALS, the trial was conducted in a heterogeneous ALS patient group of intermediate disease severity. The study (EudraCT number 2017-005065-47) was conducted at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. The trial was overseen and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Gothenburg and by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (reference number 21788). The trial was sponsored by Tikomed AB, who had no influence on the conduct of the trial and was not involved in data collection or analysis. The study protocol is described in <xref rid="pone.0267183.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref> and the verbal and written information provided to the patients were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The underpinning data that support the findings in this study are available from the EU Clinical Trials Register (available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results</ext-link> and on request from the authors).</p>

                <title>Investigational medicinal product (IMP), dose and mode of administration</title>
                <p>The active pharmaceutical ingredient of the IMP is a unique and distinct low molecular weight dextran sulphate (LMW-DS) formulation, named ILB<sup>®</sup> whose structure, formulation, synthesis and structure has been previously described in detail in a published patent document (publication number: WO 2016/076780 –New dextran sulphate). ILB<sup>®</sup> was provided by Tikomed AB in 10 mL vials containing a solution of 20 mg/mL ILB<sup>®</sup> in 9 mg/mL NaCl. A single batch of drug was used throughout the study. ILB<sup>®</sup> was injected subcutaneously on alternating sides of the abdomen by the clinical personnel at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Five injections of 1 mg/kg, with a weekly dosing interval, were administered. The exact dose administered depended on the patient’s body weight at Visit 2 (Day 1), prior to the first ILB<sup>®</sup> administration.</p>

                <p>The planned patient recruitment number to this safety and tolerability trial at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital was 15 patients with ALS. This report describes the accumulated data from the first13 patients recruited into the clinical trial, that was halted early due to the drug’s confirmed safety profile. Persons of both sexes with a definite diagnosis of ALS, including sporadic and genetic forms with either slow or rapid progression in the early phase of the disease, were screened and included into the study. The inclusion/exclusion criteria for trial entry are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0267183.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Individuals were included in the drug trial after giving informed written consent if the diagnosis of ALS was confirmed as definite according to the El Escorial criteria [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], if there was no other major degenerative or inflammatory disease and if there was a ventilatory capacity of no less than 65% of normal predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at screening.</p>

                <p>Motor neuron dysfunction and degeneration in ALS involves several pathogenic mechanisms, which include disturbed energy metabolism, cytoskeletal abnormalities, changes in transcription, glial hyperactivation and reduced glutamate uptake leading to glutamate excitotoxicity. Riluzole (Rilutek<sup>®</sup>) and lamotrigine are anti-glutaminergic drugs that are often prescribed to patients with ALS. These drugs act by reducing glutamate synthesis and release, thereby reducing glutamate excitotoxicity [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ILB<sup>®</sup> evaluated in this trial is able to modulate molecular processes relevant to ALS by enhancing the biological effects of specific growth factors which have multiple downstream consequences, including the enhancement of glutamate uptake by astrocytes [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Specifically, in glial cells ILB<sup>®</sup> reduces oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and glial activation. It also promotes cell survival, differentiation, MBP expression and glutamate uptake. In neuronal cultures ILB<sup>®</sup> reduces neuronal cell death, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In neurons the compound also promotes differentiation, neurite outgrowth and cellular homeostasis. Most importantly glutamate production and release in neuronal cells is not affected by ILB<sup>®</sup>. Rather, it enhances glutamate uptake by astrocytes. Glutamate production and release (followed by Ca<sup>+</sup>-mediated signalling cascades) in neuronal cells is one of the most important factors required for the synaptic remodelling necessary for regeneration and repair of neuronal networks affected in ALS (and indeed all neurodegenerative diseases). This process is controlled by the growth factors modulated by ILB<sup>®</sup> and their enhanced bioavailability should lead to functional benefit and clinical improvement in patients with neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
                <p>Riluzole and lamotrigine act on several neurotransmitter systems and signalling pathways. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> studies and patient side effect profiles of the drugs demonstrate that they affect glutamatergic signalling in neurons and most importantly inhibit Ca<sup>+</sup>-dependent downstream signalling in these cells [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This means that both of these anti-glutamatergic drugs inhibit mechanisms that are pivotal for the neuronal repair induced by ILB<sup>®</sup> under test in this study. In summary, based on the established mechanism of action of ILB<sup>®</sup>, it is apparent that riluzole and lamotrigine will interfere with key ILB<sup>®</sup> actions and attenuate the beneficial effects in patients. Accordingly, patients on riluzole or lamotrigine were excluded from the trial due to suspected potential interactions with ILB<sup>®</sup>. Most patients were off these drugs before they volunteered for the trial. ILB<sup>®</sup> administration started only after a minimum of 28 days washout period. All patients were offered pharmacological treatment with established drugs indicated for ALS after the end of study. Double contraception (if applicable) was mandatory during the study.</p>

Whilst the primary endpoints of the study were drug safety and tolerability, secondary endpoints relating to drug efficacy and mechanism of action were also included. The absence of patient drop-out and any drug-related SAE were deemed to be the primary criteria for judging success in this study. After the initial screening visit (Visit 1a), patients had a lumbar puncture to sample CSF biomarkers (Visit 1b, a total CSF volume of 15 mL was taken). This was followed by 5 weekly dosing visits (Visits 2–6 on Days 1–29) for administration of a single subcutaneous (sc) ILB<sup>®</sup> injection per week of 1.0 mg/kg body weight in saline into the subcutaneous fat of the lower abdomen with a maximum of 1.5 mL at each injection site. Patients underwent another sampling of CSF (Visit 7 on Day 36) one week after the last ILB<sup>®</sup> injection. Further follow-up visits (Visits 8 and 9) were made at Day 50 and Day 99 after receiving the first ILB<sup>®</sup> dose, i.e., 3 and 10 weeks after the last ILB<sup>®</sup> sc injection. The functional disability of patients was assessed using the ALSFRS-R, Norris and autonomic/sensory symptom scores pre-treatment and weekly thereafter for the 5 treatment weeks and at the follow-up visits. In parallel there was clinical evaluation of quality of life using a visual analogue scale and by dialogue between the clinical investigator and each patient plus their next of kin. Measurements of spirometry, body weight and collection of blood for laboratory safety and biomarker tests were made at each dosing visit. These measurements were repeated at 36, 50 and 99 days after treatment initiation (i.e., 7, 21 and 70 days after the last administered dose of ILB<sup>®</sup>).</p>

                  <p>Frequency, seriousness, and intensity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) or serious adverse events (SAE) were assessed throughout the study by patient reporting and testing/observation/questioning by medical personnel or investigators. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who had been administered ILB<sup>®</sup> and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of ILB<sup>®</sup>, whether or not related to the drug. A baseline event was defined as any AE in a patient that occurred after he/she signed the consent form up until the first administration of ILB<sup>®</sup>. A TEAE was defined as any AE that was not present prior to the initiation of ILB<sup>®</sup> administration or any event already present that worsened in either intensity or frequency following exposure to ILB<sup>®</sup>.</p>
                  <p>Blood tests were routinely collected at each visit during the diagnostic phase as well as during treatment and post-treatment visits to include assessment of organ function plus haematology and haemostatic parameters. All participants had a physical examination. Body weight and vital signs were recorded, pregnancy testing (if applicable), electrocardiogram, drug screening, spirometric investigation of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), as well as a quality of life assessment, HIV and hepatitis serology tests, were carried out at selected visits (see <xref rid="pone.0267183.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for the assessment timetable).</p>

CSF was collected by lumbar puncture (spinal level L3-L4; 22G spinal non-traumatic needle). The first lumbar puncture was performed after patient screening and inclusion but before the first administration of ILB<sup>®</sup>. The second lumbar puncture was performed one week after the last ILB<sup>®</sup> injection. Blood samples were drawn at defined study intervals by a venous catheter into vacutainer tubes. Laboratory analyses of blood, serum, plasma and CSF were performed immediately after collection by the Clinical Chemistry Laboratory at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Some CSF and plasma samples were collected and frozen immediately prior to storage (-80°C) in a biobank in the Sahlgrenska University Hospital until analysis was performed with a complete sample set for the specific biomarker analysis.</p>

                  <p>The ALSFRS-R provided a physician-generated validated assessment of the patient’s degree of functional impairment, which was evaluated serially to objectively assess any impact of treatment on the progression of disease [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The ALSFRS-R included questions that asked the physician to rate his/her impression of the patient’s level of functional impairment in performing twelve common tasks. Each task was rated on a five-point scale from 0 = cannot do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores were summed to produce a reported score of between 0 = worst and 48 = best. ALSFRS-R scores were analysed to provide data on the absolute change from baseline over 3 months. The Norris rating scale provided another physician-generated validated assessment of the patient’s degree of functional impairment, which was evaluated serially also to objectively assess any response to treatment or progression of disease. The Norris rating scale included questions that ask the physician to rate his/her impression of the patient’s level of functional impairment in performing 34 common tasks and bodily functions [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Each task or function was rated on a four-point scale from 0 = cannot do, to 3 = normal ability. Individual item scores were summed to produce a reported score of between 0 = worst and 100 = best. Norris scores were analysed to provide data on the absolute change from baseline over 3 months. The physician-rated assessments by ALSFRS-R and Norris scales were made after studies of functions at visits and questioning the patient about social function and disabilities.</p>

The rating scale included questions that ask the physician to rate his/her impression of the patient’s symptom severity relating to 16 non-motor, autonomic and sensory functions, including: pain; paresthesia; coldness; sweating; constipation; frequency of faeces; frequency of urination; urination difficulty, numbness; fatigue; tiredness; insomnia; arrhythmia; tachycardia; frequent waking; vertigo/dizziness. This patient cohort referred to 8/16 functions in their responses. Each symptom was rated on a five-point scale from 0 = none, to 4 = very severe.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The ethical and practical challenges of carrying out randomised placebo-controlled trials for this rare and fatal disease group meant that a small single arm trial design was deemed acceptable by the regulatory authorities for safety and tolerability assessment. This was an open label, single centre, Phase IIa proof of concept study with safety and tolerability as the primary trial outcome, so no formal sample size calculation was performed. The sample size was determined empirically and reflects the exploratory nature of the trial and the rarity of ALS. Validation of the planned (15 patients) and actual patient number (13 patients) for this exploratory clinical trial is described in detail in the <xref rid="pone.0267183.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref> Supplementary Methods. The proposed sample size was considered sufficient by the Ethics Committee of the University of Gothenburg and by the Swedish Medical Products Agency for an early Phase II exploratory trial to provide preliminary data on treatment-related adverse events and to observe trends for treatment effects on the efficacy measures chosen for this study (pilot proof of concept study with summary outcome measures, including mean, median, mode, minimum value, maximum value, range, standard deviation, etc.). Categorical data is presented as counts and percentages. Continuous data are summarised using descriptive statistics. The baseline pre-treatment measurements (Visit 2) of the patients were compared to those at intervals during and after treatment using either the paired Student <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test or analysis of variance as applicable. In quantitative data, values of P&lt;0.05 were considered as statistically significant. There was no correction of the Type I error (multiple analysis) due to the exploratory nature of the study. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica software and SAS systems (SAS version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All pharmacokinetic calculations were performed using Phoenix<sup>®</sup> WinNonlin version 8.1, build 8.1.0.3530 (Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA).</p>

                <p>There were no deaths or SAEs reported during the study. There was no discontinuation of IMP administration during the study and no patient withdrawal due to AEs. During the treatment period, 9/13 patients experienced 14 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), with 4 of these judged as possibly related to the IMP (acne, subcutaneous hematoma, fatigue, and pyrexia) (<xref rid="pone.0267183.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). These TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity and were all resolved without requiring any action related to the IMP. All injection-related bruises healed within one week without discomfort to the patient. Lumbar puncture at spinal level of L3-L4 was performed twice in each patient (one week before first and one week after last ILB<sup>®</sup> dose) and left no haematoma or remaining pain. One patient had a short-lasting pain during spinal tap of the first puncture but not on the second occasion. One patient had a moderate headache during the day after lumbar puncture, resolving within 24 hours without treatment. Two patients with need of a walking aid due to their ALS symptoms stumbled and fell during walking (one while travelling to the clinic, the other at home) during the study and got minor skin bruises, healing without scars. Both had a history of stumbling and falling before and after the clinical study (for further details see <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results</ext-link>).

                <p>The patient group showed an improvement in the clinical ratings evidenced by both the ALSFRS-R and the Norris rating scales that became apparent after the first injection (Visit 2 at Day 1) and was enhanced throughout the treatment period until termination of the injections (<xref rid="pone.0267183.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). The changes in clinical scores from baseline illustrates the improvement in function experienced during ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment measured by both ALSFRS-R and Norris rating (e.g., an increase of +2.5 in the ALSFRS-R scores and +7.3 in the Norris scores over the treatment period). In addition, most patients reported an increased vitality (feeling more energetic, strong, and active) during the first day post-injection, with decreased spasticity and muscular weakness from Day 3 onwards associated with a concomitant improvement in muscular and bulbar symptoms. During the post-treatment follow-up visits, the measurable improvement in clinical function was maintained for 3–4 weeks after the last dosage, i.e., until Visit 8 at 50 Days. However, after this time the improvement in function was lost, so that the measures taken at Visit 9 at 99 Days, were not significantly different from the pre-treatment clinical ratings. However, none of the patients progressed to their predicted level of functional deficit based on their baseline characteristics by Day 36, and the attenuation of predicted disease progression was sustained in most patients at Day 99 (<xref rid="pone.0267183.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). This indicated a lasting post-treatment beneficial effect of the ILB<sup>®</sup> injections of 3–4 weeks.

                <p>The levels of CSF and serum NfL were stable during the study period, as were the levels of other disease biomarkers including tau, phosphor-tau, albumin, IgG, IgM, IgGindex, IgMindex and proteasome-complement complexes (for further details see <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results</ext-link>). However, there was a statistically significant decrease from 421 ± 337to 364 ± 299U/L (P&lt;0.05) in plasma creatine kinase and also in plasma myoglobin (down from 133.92 ± 126, to 103.69 ± 72.16 μg/mL, P = 0.021) during the treatment period, indicating an attenuation in the rate of muscle tissue degeneration (<xref rid="pone.0267183.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The ILB<sup>®</sup> used in this study has now been designated an orphan medicinal product for ALS (an orphan disease) by both the European Medicine Agency and the Food and Drug Administration (United States). Small, single arm, open label trials with safety and clinically relevant endpoints are accepted as an essential first step in drug development for these challenging conditions [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In designing this first safety and tolerability clinical trial of ILB<sup>®</sup> in patients with ALS, we used well documented safety data, longitudinal data gathering, multiple endpoints, and baseline adjustments to design a trial that would generate meaningful proof of concept data from a relatively small cohort of participants.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, a favourable safety and tolerability profile was evident for the ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment regime applied in this ALS patient cohort. There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported after ILB<sup>®</sup> administration, nor were there any patient withdrawals during the study. Of the 14 laboratory or patient reported treatment-emergent adverse events in this study, 10 were deemed to be unrelated to the IMP, with 13 being of mild and just 1 of moderate severity. This confirmed the positive safety profile seen with this drug in pre-clinical toxicology and Phase I/II human studies, even when several-fold higher doses of ILB<sup>®</sup> were used in these latter studies. Thus, the trial was implemented successfully to its planned conclusion, and the drug safety and tolerability revealed was such that larger efficacy trials in patients with ALS can be contemplated. By these criteria, the trial was judged to be a success.</p>
              <p>The pharmacokinetics of ILB<sup>®</sup> indicated rapid blood absorption of the drug after sc ILB<sup>®</sup> injection, followed by fast clearance. As ILB<sup>®</sup> is excreted within 8–12 hours after intravenous injection [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the clinical effects seen in the first week after injection were probably caused by the drug activating multiple biological mechanisms that were sustained after the elimination of ILB<sup>®</sup> from body fluids. It is possible that, like some other dextran sulphates, ILB<sup>®</sup> acts as a heparin mimetic, releasing and activating numerous heparin-binding growth factors sequestered in the extracellular matrix, aiding their redistribution and prolonging their half-life in soluble form [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The release, activation and circulation of multiple growth factors from peripheral and central tissues would initiate a programme of diverse down-stream cellular responses relating to metabolism, tissue repair and regeneration. The PK of ILB<sup>®</sup> after sc injection in patients with ALS is strikingly similar to that seen in previous clinical studies [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and with plasma HGF levels, both peaking at 2.5 hours. The parallel pharmacokinetics of ILB<sup>®</sup> and HGF suggests a heparinoid-like effect for ILB<sup>®</sup>, initiating the release of growth factor from the endothelial cell surface into the circulation.</p>
              <p>Although the small size and open-label nature of this study, as well as the lack of rigour of the statistical analysis, necessitates an extremely cautious interpretation, the results of the secondary endpoints (including a limited panel of blood biomarkers that are reported here and elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) suggest the potential for treatment-related change in the progression of ALS. We are mindful that this trial was not placebo controlled, and open label trials are bound to have strong placebo effects in up to 30% of patients [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A measurable (using two widely adopted ALSFRS-R and Norris scoring systems) functional recovery emerged in this small patient cohort within one week of treatment initiation, that increased to statistical significance during the treatment period of five weekly ILB<sup>®</sup> injections. The alleviation of clinical symptoms lasted for 3–4 weeks after the last injection and was followed by a slow resumption of disease progression during the remaining 7 weeks of the follow-up period. Patient reported side effects of the drug were mild, with a feeling of increased physical vitality (defined as relating to the patient perceived levels of energy and fatigue) experienced 5–6 hours after ILB<sup>®</sup> injection, effects that lasted for the trial duration. This observation was reflected in a decrease after treatment of 25% (P&lt;0.02) in the scores for patient perceived levels of tiredness and fatigue as measured in the Subjective Sensory and Autonomic Symptoms assessment panel. These reported rapid responses in patient perceived energy levels may relate, in part, to ILB<sup>®</sup> initiating improvements in tissue energy metabolism, as described elsewhere for this drug both in the injured rodent brain [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and in this same cohort of patients with ALS [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>The plasma levels of creatine kinase and myoglobin (biomarkers mainly related to degeneration/injury of muscle mass) were higher at entry to the study in the patients with ALS, as in a large proportion of patients with ALS, compared to the normal level in the population [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The levels of both plasma creatine kinase and myoglobin decreased significantly during ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment, with plasma myoglobin proving to be a more responsive measure than creatine kinase. This apparent inconsistency probably reflects the relatively short period of treatment and observation in this study, coupled with the earlier responsiveness, shorter half-life and availability of a more sensitive assay for plasma myoglobin [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, the biochemical evidence of reduced muscle degeneration supports the clinical observations of improved muscle function reflected in the ALSFRS-R and Norris rating scales. Many of the functions relevant to these rating scores are mediated by cervical, trunk, lumbosacral, and respiratory muscles and scores in these categories show close agreement with objective measures of muscle strength [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The reduction in the rate of muscle atrophy evidenced by reduced plasma creatine kinase and myoglobin may also be linked to the observed post-treatment attenuation in the rate of pulmonary function decline.</p>
              <p>ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment also decreased the scored symptoms of autonomic/sensory dysfunction and the common general complaint among the patients of coldness and freezing almost totally disappeared during the treatment course. With weekly injections of ILB<sup>®</sup>, patients reported decreased spasticity and improvements in gait, talking and swallowing, presumably reflecting the additional influence of mobilized neurotrophic and myotrophic factors. The improvements noted in motor and autonomic functions were reflected in the enhanced physical well-being score in the QoL assessment.</p>
              <p>The indications of early functional benefit of ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment to neural and muscle tissues seen in this study may partly relate to an acute stimulant effect of ILB<sup>®</sup> on the release of heparin-binding growth factors, including HGF [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. HGF is a potent endogenous neurotrophic and myogenic factor synthesised locally and stored in the extracellular matrix of peripheral and central tissues. It has direct protective activities on motor neurons and muscle cells and indirect activities through actions on macrophages and glia, by stimulating glucose transport and metabolism and also by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and glutamatergic neurotoxicity [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
              <p>How ILB<sup>®</sup> acts on the brain in patients with ALS remains to be established, although its reported positive effects on compromised brain energy metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] would be important [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. CSF NfL levels have been linked to the destruction of large CNS neurons and we have previously reported a direct relation between CSF levels of NfL and the aggressiveness of the disease, as revealed by the time of survival of the patient from first clinical symptoms of ALS until death [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Here, no change in CSF levels of NfL before and after ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment was evident. Since the turnover of CSF NfL is slow, the 6-week interval between lumbar punctures may have been too short for ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment to have a measurable impact upon the level of NfL in the CSF compartment. However, the stabilisation of this biomarker of neurodegeneration may be indicative of treatment benefit.</p>
              <p>Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ALS, particularly contributing to the peripheral neurodegeneration leading to muscle atrophy. Proteasomes are essential for the degradation of proteins in degenerating tissues and they form complexes with complement activation fragments (compleasomes) as part of the innate immune system response [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this cohort of patients with ALS, CSF and plasma proteasome-complement complex levels were elevated prior to treatment compared to levels in healthy persons [<xref rid="pone.0267183.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267183.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but there were no consistent treatment-related changes in the proteasome-complement levels in the patient group as a whole. Yet, patients with rapid progress of the disease had particularly high levels of plasma proteasome-complement complex at the start of ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment and this sub-group experienced a marked decrease (-60% of the initial very high levels of proteasome complex) after ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this Phase IIa pilot clinical trial in patients with ALS, ILB<sup>®</sup> treatment was shown to be safe and well tolerated. There were few side-effects, no severe adverse events and good drug tolerance after injection of ILB<sup>®</sup> at the tested dose once a week for 5 weeks. The increased functional scores after treatment initiation associated with stabilisation of most disease biomarkers must be cautiously interpreted due to the significant study limitations (small size and open-label nature of this study, lack of rigour of statistical analysis, etc.) but are suggestive of a possible disease modifying effect. Further studies on ILB<sup>®</sup> dosage and duration, inter-dosage intervals and possible long-term effects are in progress, but the present report supports ILB<sup>®</sup> as the first safe, well tolerated treatment with potential to arrest/reverse the clinical symptoms of ALS.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Ann Logan et al.</p>
              <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by rapid progression of upper and lower motor neuron loss, which causes paralysis and death within 2-5 years from disease onset. However only riluzole, which have beneficial effects in a limited population of patients with ALS, have been approved.</p>
              <p>In this manuscript, Ann Logan et al., revealed that no serious adverse events or participant withdrawal were observed in clinical trial of LMW-DS in patients with ALS. The results also showed that ALSFRS-R improved after treatment. Although this study provides important results, this paper will be improved by addressing these issues. The specific concerns are listed below.</p>
              <p>Major issues:</p>
              <p>1. Progression rate of ALSFRS-R and disease duration should be included in the background of patients, as the change in ALSFRS-R is strongly influenced by the disease progression.</p>
              <p>2. Effectiveness of treatment should be established by the demonstration of a treatment effect on function in daily activities such as ALFRS-R. However, given the open-label trial, it would have been helpful to include quantitative motor function as an objective measurement.</p>
              <p>3. It is not a scientific expression to state that a patient's vitality has increased, especially in an open-label trial.</p>
              <p>4. FDA recommends the consideration of add-on designs, in which a treatment previously shown to be effective for the treatment of ALS is given to all patients participating in the trial, with patients randomized to the added investigational drug or added placebo. Too much justification for open-label trial should be avoided. In addition, it should be explained in detail that patients taking riluzole are not eligible to participate in this trial.</p>
              <p>5. Pain and autonomic dysfunction are not typical neurological findings in ALS patients, why did you assess these symptoms?</p>
              <p>6. I can't find out the details of the scores for severity of the autonomic and sensory symptoms, but are vertigo and fatigue classified autonomic or sensory symptoms?</p>
              <p>7. To investigate the correlation between the change of serum HGF and clinical measures such as ALSFRS-R would support the hypothesis that increased serum HGF improves motor function of patients with ALS.</p>
              <p>Minor issues</p>
              <p>1. What subscores of the ALSFRS-R have improved in ALS patients?</p>
              <p>2. HGF should be spelled out.</p>
              <p>3. The authors need to correct writing errors (FCV→FVC, Line226; forced ventilatory capacity→forced vital capacity, Line294).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is a manuscript reporting the outcome in an early Phase 2 trial. As it stands there are serious issues in the reporting as the paper does not reflect the protocol. For example, the primary endpoints of the protocol are not mentioned here; nor are the success criteria - what is considered acceptable on these endpoints?</p>
              <p>Also the trial was slated to recruit 15 patients. Only 13 were apparently approached according to the flow chart (not a CONSORT diagram as the trial is not randomised). So why was the number to be approached changed? Why was the trial not conducted as stated in the protocol. The methods section does not state the aspiration of the study, and the actual planned number is hidden in the protocol.</p>
              <p>The patient characteristics are a result and not a method - this section including Table 1 needs to lead the results.</p>
              <p>Please explain why the use of statistical tests here is not in line with the protocol which talks of summary measures only. Please give actual p-values and not just p&lt;0.xx when the p-value exceeds 0.001. What work was done to demonstrate that the data were Normally distributed?</p>
              <p>It is incorrect to only report significant results (e.g. Table 7) - please give effect sizes and CI here and report all tests done - what was the hypothesis here?</p>
              <p>Dynamite plots (e.g. Fig 4,5) give less information than a table would - especially given the serial nature of the data Figure 5C is in particular the wrong figure and again selects only the significant differences. Figure 6 would be clearer as a table.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This is a concept-of-proof open, uncontrolled study on a very small and clinically heterogeneous ALS population treated with LMW-DS and followed up for a short time. The molecule is supposed to be effective mainly by stimulating the production of HGF.</p>
              <p>The molecule and hypothesized mechanism of action is quite innovative and interesting. In addition, new trials in this population are always welcome given the lack of effective treatments for such a severe and incurable condition. Nevertheless, preclinical data about LMW-DS in neurological disorders are limited and experiments on ALS animal models are lacking. This limitation must be declared by the authors.</p>
              <p>Safety and tolerability as primary endpoint are well documented and particular attention has been paid to any coagulation disorder potentially related to HGF. In my view, nevertheless, no inference can be drawn about clinical advantages. A clinical impression of "increased vitality, decreased spasticity and increased mobility" and even a transient improvement in functional scales have no relevance in such a small uncontrolled trial. Only robust changes in biological markers can be taken into account in this phase of the experimental study. This strong limitation must be stressed by the authors.</p>
              <p>Despite these limitations, in my opinion, the study deserves attention and additional development</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: This manuscript by Logan and Coll. reports results of a phase II clinical study with molecular weight dextran sulphate in ALS. Besides demonstrating a good safety and tolerability of the IMP (primary end-point of the study), authors noted a significant clinical benefit of the drug on patients' mobility (as measured according to the ALSFRSr and Norris rating).</p>
              <p>Basically flawn by the very small number of enorolled patients, this study raises questions and concerns.</p>
              <p>Questions:</p>
              <p>1. ALSFRSr score improves on average of 4 points after 3 months since the first injection of the IMP (and after 2 months after the last injection). Then, how do the authors explain the worsening of FVC values at day 99? Which are the ALSFRSr items improving?</p>
              <p>2. What is the reference interval for CK values? why there was no blood CK sampling at day 99? Are creatinine values available?</p>
              <p>3. why did the authors evaluate autonomic functions? What exactly is the autonomic and sensory rating scale used in the trial?</p>
              <p>Concerns:</p>
              <p>1. the IMP used in this study seems to reverse the natural decline of ALSFRSr overtime observed in ALS (without affecting objective measures like NFl or FVC). It is established that NFls are stable throughout the disease, therefore NFL stabilization shown here was expected and it is not a "positive" result. Furthermore, benefit is prompt. Authors should discuss, somewhere in the discussion, the chance of a placebo effect</p>
              <p>2. Accordingly, why did not the authors evaluate QoL at day 99?</p>

              <p>Major issues:</p>
              <p>1. Progression rate of ALSFRS-R and disease duration should be included in the background of patients, as the change in ALSFRS-R is strongly influenced by the disease progression. </p>
              <p>Response: The Lead Clinical Investigator for this trial has treated more than 1000 ALS patients during his 45 years as a neurologist, following patients from diagnosis until death and has made multiple studies both on drug treatment as well as on the course of the disease. In Scandinavia there are at least 30 different ALS forms, by genetic, inflammatory and/or destructive kind. ALS is thus a very heterogeneous constellation of disease. ALS causes a degeneration of neurons and glia. The destruction of cells and the progress of disease is not linear in each patient during his/her course of disease: some months they have a slow decrease in function and during other periods they have a more rapid progress. There can be a variable arrest of symptoms for months or even years in some patients, but the survival from first symptoms till death is usually 2-5 years, while 10 % have a longer survival. The disease appears in 65% of males, in 35 % of females. The course is often slower in females than in males.</p>
              <p>Together, this makes pre-treatment disease progression and disease duration of very limited predictive value in indicating response to treatment of this very heterogeneous disease. Indeed, this small pilot safety study was open to patients of a deliberately heterogeneous background to ensure the relevance of the outcomes to most ALS etiologies. The patients were selected to have different clinical characteristics with respect to the mixture of rate of progress, of age and sex, the type of dysfunction (genetic or sporadic disease, flaccid or spastic paresis, talking or swallowing problems and rate of muscle weakness/muscle atrophy/grade of spasticity).</p>
              <p>What is beyond dispute is that, whatever the etiology and clinical characteristics of the patient, once ALS is diagnosed disease progression is NEVER REVERSED so ANY indication of such a response in the outcome data is important. As this small pilot study was designed primarily as a safety and tolerability study for a heterogeneous patient cohort we have, accordingly, been very cautious in attaching significance to the observations of changes in the ALSFRS-R scores despite a positive response from all treated patients.</p>
              <p>Notwithstanding the above discussion, as requested we have now included data on the ‘Years since onset of disease symptoms’ for each patient in a new Table 4 on Page 23/24 in the Results section (necessitating renumbering of all Tables). </p>
              <p>2. Effectiveness of treatment should be established by the demonstration of a treatment effect on function in daily activities such as ALFRS-R. However, given the open-label trial, it would have been helpful to include quantitative motor function as an objective measurement.</p>
              <p>Response: Quantifiable muscle strength and muscle enzymes depend on the amount of muscle exercise achieved by individuals from day to day, this varies from day to day and patient to patient. Some ALS patients do not even have major peripheral muscle dysfunction but have swallowing or spasticity problems dominating. Most of the challenges in quantitating motor function in ALS patients therefore relate to the disease’s remarkably protean nature. Such heterogeneity adds a challenge that is not present for many other neuromuscular conditions. The difficulties in assessing motor function in ALS patients are described in detail in this review: Rutkove, S.B. Clinical Measures of Disease Progression in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Neurotherapeutics 12, 384–393 (2015). <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13311-014-0331-9" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s13311-014-0331-9</ext-link>
</p>
              <p>We have used two of the most reliable and widely used clinical rating scales for ALS in this study: the ALSFRS-R, which is simple to use in patients with muscle and swallowing problems, and the Norris scale, which is more detailed and elucidates a more comprehensive picture of patient functions. Of relevance here, and described on Page 36 Lines 623-625, many of the assessments made as part of ALSFRS-R and Norris (both are Functional Rating Scores) relate to both gross and fine motor skills, e.g., handwriting, speech, swallowing, respiration, dressing, walking, turning in bed, cutting food, climbing stairs, etc., and the scores in these categories show close agreement with objective measures of muscle strength (reference 30).</p>
              <p>It should also be noted that this is the first early and small initial safety study of the ILB® in ALS and a more comprehensive testing regime can be incorporated into future larger scale placebo-controlled trials with efficacy as a primary outcome.</p>
              <p>3. It is not a scientific expression to state that a patient's vitality has increased, especially in an open-label trial.</p>
              <p>Response: Vitality is related to the patient’s perceived levels of energy and fatigue. This was specifically assessed and subjectively quantified as part of the sensory and autonomic symptom panel (tiredness and fatigue subscores). When the scores for these categories were compared before and after treatment, there was a decrease of 25% (P&lt;0.02). This has now been better defined and clarified on Page 35 Lines 600-610.</p>
              <p>4. FDA recommends the consideration of add-on designs, in which a treatment previously shown to be effective for the treatment of ALS is given to all patients participating in the trial, with patients randomized to the added investigational drug or added placebo. Too much justification for open-label trial should be avoided. </p>
              <p>Response: We believe that detailing the steps we have taken in the trial design to ensure the generation of meaningful proof of concept data from a small patient cohort are important to those readers who may not be fully cognisant of the challenges in developing drugs for rare orphan diseases with fatal outcomes. However, we accept that we may have laboured this point somewhat. Accordingly, we have shortened this first paragraph in the discussion on Pages 32-33 Lines 541-548 to make it more specific. </p>
              <p>5. In addition, it should be explained in detail that patients taking riluzole are not eligible to participate in this trial.</p>
              <p>Response: Motor neuron dysfunction and degeneration in ALS involves several pathogenic mechanisms, which include disturbed energy metabolism, cytoskeletal abnormalities, changes in transcription, glutamate excitotoxicity, glial hyperactivation and reduced glutamate uptake. In our in vitro models we found that the ILB® is able to modulate molecular processes relevant to ALS by modulating the biological effects of growth factors, with multiple downstream consequences. In glial cells the ILB® reduces oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and glial activation. It also promotes cell survival, differentiation, MBP expression and glutamate uptake. In neuronal cultures ILB® reduces neuronal cell death, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In neurons the compound also promotes differentiation, neurite outgrowth and cellular homeostasis. Most importantly glutamate production and release in neuronal cells is NOT affected by ILB®. Rather, ILB® enhances glutamate uptake by astrocytes. Glutamate production and release (followed by Ca+-mediated signalling cascades) in neuronal cells is one of the most important factors required for synaptic remodelling necessary for regeneration and repair of neuronal networks affected in ALS (and indeed all neurodegenerative diseases). This process is controlled by the growth factors modulated by ILB® and leads to neurite outgrowth and differentiation of these cells. This is the process that will lead to a measurable functional benefit in the nervous system and clinical improvement in the patients with ALS. </p>
              <p>Riluzole and lamotrigine are drugs that affect several neurotransmitter systems and signalling pathways (see references 12,13 and 14 in the manuscript). In vitro studies and patients side effect profiles of the drug demonstrate that riluzole/lamotrigine affects glutamatergic signalling in neurones and most importantly inhibit Ca+-dependent downstream signalling in these cells. This means that riluzole and lamotrigine inhibit some of the same mechanisms that are pivotal for the restoration of neural function induced by ILB®. In summary, based on the established mechanism of action of our drug, it is clear that riluzole/lamotrigine will interfere with key ILB® actions and prevent the beneficial effects in patients.</p>
              <p> As requested, this has now been set out in detail on Pages 8-9 Lines 164-195 of the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>6. Pain and autonomic dysfunction are not typical neurological findings in ALS patients, why did you assess these symptoms?</p>
              <p>Response: In fact, 30-50 % of ALS patients have pain and other sensory and autonomic symptoms and dysfunction during the course of their ALS disease. This is well described in the following review and editorial:</p>
              <p>Chiò A, Mora G, Lauria G. Pain in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Lancet Neurol. 2017 Feb;16(2):144-157. doi: 10.1016/S1474-4422(16)30358-1. Epub 2016 Dec 8. PMID: 27964824.</p>

              <p>The subjective occurrence of pain, sensory and autonomic complaints and symptoms are easily rated as we have done in this study and this monitoring is important to the patients and next of kin. The information is used to inform treatment options for individual patients. To clarify for the reader, we have re-named these symptoms as Subjective Sensory and Autonomic Symptoms on Page 20 Line330. </p>
              <p>Below are some of our publications that describe the impact of these symptoms and our contribution to their investigation:</p>

              <p>7. I can't find out the details of the scores for severity of the autonomic and sensory symptoms, but are vertigo and fatigue classified autonomic or sensory symptoms?</p>
              <p>Response: Vertigo is often a symptom of an autonomic neuropathy but may also have a sensory causation. Similarly, fatigue is strongly associated with autonomic dysfunction.</p>
              <p>The 16 symptom categories related to autonomic/sensory dysfunction that were evaluated in this study were as follows: pain; paresthesia; coldness; sweating; constipation; frequency of faeces; frequency of urination; urination difficulty, numbness; fatigue; tiredness; insomnia; arrhythmia; tachycardia; frequent waking; vertigo/dizziness.</p>
              <p>This is now better detailed in the Methods section now entitled Subjective Rating of Sensory and Autonomic Symptoms on Page 20-21, Lines 334-342.</p>
              <p>8. To investigate the correlation between the change of serum HGF and clinical measures such as ALSFRS-R would support the hypothesis that increased serum HGF improves motor function of patients with ALS.</p>
              <p>Response: This small study has not generated data that can establish a causal relationship between HGF levels and change in ALSFRS-R scores. We note that clinical trials delivering recombinant HGF have achieved serum levels of 20,000 pg/mL with measurable functional effects (e.g., Ido A, Moriuchi A, Numata M, Murayama T, Teramukai S, Marusawa H, Yamaji N, Setoyama H, Kim ID, Chiba T, Higuchi S, Yokode M, Fukushima M, Shimizu A, Tsubouchi H. Safety and pharmacokinetics of recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (rh-HGF) in patients with fulminant hepatitis: a phase I/II clinical trial, following preclinical studies to ensure safety. J Transl Med. 2011 May 8;9:55. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-9-55. PMID: 21548996; PMCID: PMC3112439). Our observation that ILB® treatment elevates serum levels to 41,691 pg/mL suggest that the HGF levels achieved in this cohort of patients with ALS are more than sufficient to activate downstream cellular signalling through the C-Met receptor, with beneficial functional effects as indicated. Larger studies with variable doses of ILB® versus placebo lie in the future and these may allow such a link to be made.</p>
              <p>Minor issues</p>
              <p>9. What subscores of the ALSFRS-R have improved in ALS patients? </p>
              <p>Response: Since this cohort of patients was deliberately chosen to be heterogeneous, their functional insufficiencies were also heterogeneous and varied from individual to individual. Accordingly, when the patient data was pooled we saw improvements in all ALSFRS-R subscores, but the extent of improvement in each category varied between individuals. It is therefore meaningless to analyse and compare individual ALSFRS-R subscores in this small cohort of patients.</p>
              <p>10. HGF should be spelled out.</p>
              <p>Response: We have done this on Page 5 Line 98-99.</p>
              <p>11. The authors need to correct writing errors (FCV→FVC, Line226; forced ventilatory capacity→forced vital capacity, Line 294).</p>
              <p>Response: We have corrected this on Pages 18 Line 272-273 and Page 21 Line 344.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 1</p>

              <p>Reviewer 2</p>
              <p>1. This is a manuscript reporting the outcome in an early Phase 2 trial. As it stands there are serious issues in the reporting as the paper does not reflect the protocol. For example, the primary endpoints of the protocol are not mentioned here; nor are the success criteria - what is considered acceptable on these endpoints?</p>
              <p>Response: The primary and secondary endpoints of the trial were clearly stated on Page 13 Lines 213-215 of the manuscript as being ‘drug safety and tolerability, secondary endpoints relating to drug efficacy and mechanism of action were also included’. These primary and secondary outcomes were also described in more detail in Section 7 of the supplementary document S1 Trial Protocol, in which Appendix One defines the specific risk assessments made and the treatment stopping criteria as ‘clinical findings which constitute a medical significant risk’. This explicitly states this to be defined as: ‘Serious Adverse Events (SAE) that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment, including all risks categorized as of grade C (as stated in Appendix 1). </p>
              <p>As described in the European Medicines Agency document entitled ICH Topic E 9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials: ‘In all clinical trials evaluation of safety and tolerability constitutes an important element. In early phases this evaluation is mostly of an exploratory nature, and is only sensitive to frank expressions of toxicity, whereas in later phases the establishment of the safety and tolerability profile of a drug can be characterised more fully in larger samples of subjects’. Accordingly, this small pilot trial gathered data on all adverse effects off the drug and was specifically looking for drug-related SAE. The absence of any drug-related SAE and the tolerability of the drug were deemed to be the primary criteria for success in this study.</p>
              <p>In response to the reviewer, we have now added a sentence to the methods section of manuscript on Page 13 Lines 215-216 that describe what we deemed to be appropriate success criteria for these primary outcomes. We have also added a related comment in the Discussion on Page 33 Lines 564-567.</p>
              <p>2. Also the trial was stated to recruit 15 patients. Only 13 were apparently approached according to the flow chart (not a CONSORT diagram as the trial is not randomised). So why was the number to be approached changed? Why was the trial not conducted as stated in the protocol? </p>
              <p>Response: Note that we used the 2016 CONSORT diagram relevant to pilot and feasibility trials in Figure 1 with adaptions as recommended by Lancaster, G.A., Thabane, L. Guidelines for reporting non-randomised pilot and feasibility studies. Pilot Feasibility Stud 5, 114 (2019). <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40814-019-0499-1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/s40814-019-0499-1</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>The planned number of patients to be included in this safety and tolerability study was 15, however due to delays in recruitment, and the fact that no SAEs or other safety concerns were reported in the first 13 patients, it was decided by the Sponsor, along with the local clinical and ethical agencies, to terminate patient recruitment and conclude the study with the 13. </p>
              <p>The intention to widen this first safety study to a conventional placebo-controlled study was always planned and, as the findings at this first pilot study indicated safety, tolerability and a positive clinical response in all of the first 13 patients tested, it was decided to shorten the study from the planned 15 to 13 patients, to save 5 months of study time, complete the data analysis of the first 13 patients, and use this to more rapidly initiate planning of a larger conventional placebo-controlled study.</p>
              <p> This change in recruitment number plus the reason for it is now described in the Results section on Page 22 Lines 382-87.</p>
              <p>3. The methods section does not state the aspiration of the study, and the actual planned number is hidden in the protocol.</p>
              <p>Response: We clearly stated the planned primary outcomes (aspirations?) of this trial in the methods on Page 6 Lines 113-114 and again on Page 13 Lines 213-215 in the Methods section. We also mention this in the Abstract (Page 3 Lines 32-34), state a hypothesis in the last paragraph of the Introduction (Page 6 Lines 103-106) and I quote from Page 6 Lines 112-114: ‘The clinical trial was a Phase IIa, single-centre, open label, single-arm proof of concept study of a small number of patients, where the primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of subcutaneously administered ILB®.’ </p>
              <p>As requested, we have now described the planned versus actual number of patients recruited to the trial, plus the reason for the change, on Page 22 Lines 382-387 in the Results section.</p>
              <p>4. The patient characteristics are a result and not a method - this section including Table 1 needs to lead the results.</p>
              <p>Response: As the reviewer suggests we have moved this information to a new Results section entitled ‘Patient demographics and baseline clinical characteristics with renumbered Tables 3 and 4 on Page 23-24.</p>
              <p>5. Please explain why the use of statistical tests here is not in line with the protocol which talks of summary measures only. Please give actual p-values and not just p&lt;0.xx when the p-value exceeds 0.001. What work was done to demonstrate that the data were Normally distributed?</p>
              <p>Response: As is well established, the summary measures indicated in the trial protocol provide a quick and simple description of the data and include mean, median, mode, minimum value, maximum value, range, standard deviation, etc. It is appropriate to use this data to perform a paired Student t test or ANOVA to compare the mean of two groups of related samples and to evaluate whether the means of the two sets of data are statistically significantly different from each other. These analyses are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan associated with the clinical trial protocol (see Appendix S1). Exact P values have been given (for example, see Table 8 on Page 31). Normal distribution of data was confirmed by comparing medians and means and by plotting histograms of the frequency distribution of the analysis variable.</p>
              <p>6. It is incorrect to only report significant results (e.g., Table 7) - please give effect sizes and CI here and report all tests done - what was the hypothesis here?</p>
              <p>Response: The trial protocol and the methods section clearly describes all of the measurements taken on these patients and the related raw data is available on-line to the interested reader who wants more in depth information (link provided in the manuscript on Page 26 Lines 442-443 at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results</ext-link> and available on request from the authors). To report all data pertaining to non-significant differences within the manuscript would seem superfluous and of limited value to most readers. </p>
              <p>The trial hypothesis is clearly stated on Page 5 Lines 103-106 of the Introduction.</p>
              <p>7. Dynamite plots (e.g. Fig 4,5) give less information than a table would - especially given the serial nature of the data. Figure 5C is in particular the wrong figure and again selects only the significant differences. </p>
              <p>Response: We respectfully disagree since the source data is available for detailed evaluation by the interested reader on-line at: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/results</ext-link></p>
              <p>and is also available on request from the authors. We feel that the graphical representation of the data we have made illustrate the outcomes in a visual and easily understandable way, particularly for the non-expert reader.</p>
              <p>8 Figure 6 would be clearer as a table.</p>
              <p>Response: We respectfully suggest that the graphical representation of the data we have made in Figure 6 better illustrates the changes in clinical characteristics before and after treatment than would a large table of numbers.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 3</p>
              <p>1. This is a concept-of-proof open, uncontrolled study on a very small and clinically heterogeneous ALS population treated with ILB® and followed up for a short time. The molecule is supposed to be effective mainly by stimulating the production of HGF. The molecule and hypothesized mechanism of action is quite innovative and interesting. In addition, new trials in this population are always welcome given the lack of effective treatments for such a severe and incurable condition. Nevertheless, preclinical data about ILB® in neurological disorders are limited and experiments on ALS animal models are lacking. This limitation must be declared by the authors.</p>
              <p>Response: As requested, we have added a short section in the Introduction on Page 5 Lines 93-97 to address this limitation.</p>
              <p>2. Safety and tolerability as primary endpoint are well documented and particular attention has been paid to any coagulation disorder potentially related to HGF. In my view, nevertheless, no inference can be drawn about clinical advantages. A clinical impression of "increased vitality, decreased spasticity and increased mobility" and even a transient improvement in functional scales have no relevance in such a small uncontrolled trial. Only robust changes in biological markers can be taken into account in this phase of the experimental study. This strong limitation must be stressed by the authors.</p>
              <p>Response: We believe that we have been very cautious in making any claims about the efficacy of ILB®, focussing primarily on safety and tolerability and only indicating potential for efficacy. Indeed, we state in the discussion about efficacy on Page 34 Line 586-590: ‘Although the small size and open-label nature of this study, as well as the lack of rigour of the statistical analysis, necessitates an extremely cautious interpretation, the results of the secondary endpoints (including a limited panel of blood biomarkers that are reported here and elsewhere [39]) suggest the potential for treatment-related change in the progression of ALS.’</p>
              <p> Further evidence of drug efficacy in this same cohort of patients is provided by the serum biomarker results (myoglobin and creatine kinase levels reported here and levels of metabolic biomarkers now reported elsewhere: Lazzarino G, Mangione R, Belli A, Di Pietro V, Nagy Z, Barnes NM, Bruce L, Ropero BM, Persson LI, Manca B, Tavazzi B, Lazzarino G, Logan A. ILB® attenuates oxidative/nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Journal of Personlized Medicine 2021, 11, x.

              <p>As requested, we have added this reference in the Discussion section [new Reference 39] to indicate the biomarker data generated in this patient cohort and also emphasised this limitation in the Discussion on Page 34 Lines 586-590.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 4</p>
              <p>1. ALSFRS-R score improves on average of 4 points after 3 months since the first injection of the IMP (and after 2 months after the last injection). Then, how do the authors explain the worsening of FVC values at day 99? Which are the ALSFRS-R items improving?</p>
              <p>Response: The FVC values decline at Day 99 along with a resumption of decline in ALSFRS-R and Norris scores at Day 99. As described, ILB® treatment seems to have slowed, but not reversed, the decline in FVC values, presumably because of the more muted response of the complex neuromuscular control of this function. This attenuation in decline of the FVC values is also reflected in the lack of change in the ALSFRS-R sub-score for Respiratory Insufficiency. Please also see Point 9 of my response to the Editor.</p>
              <p>2. What is the reference interval for CK values? why there was no blood CK sampling at day 99? Are creatinine values available?</p>
              <p>Response: we apologise as we mistakenly defined the creatine kinase units as U/L in old Table 7 when the assay actually measured plasma creatine kinase as ukat/L. We have corrected this by converting the measured ukat/L values of creatine kinase to U/L in new Table 8 on Page 31 and this reveals the change from 421±337 U/L at Day 1 (Pre-treatment) to 364±299 U/L at Day 36 (Post-treatment). In a healthy Swedish adults, the serum CK level is reported to vary with a number of factors (gender, race and activity), but the normal range is 24-204 U/L (the reference interval) and healthy adult values of CK are reported in Reference 41. Higher amounts of serum CK can indicate muscle damage due to chronic disease or acute muscle injury (see Reference 41).</p>
              <p>The protocol indicates that no blood samples were taken for biomarkers at Day 99 in order to minimise interventions on this very sick cohort of patients. Creatine levels were measured in these patients but there was no change in the values recorded over the monitoring period (reported in new Reference 39).</p>
              <p>3. Why did the authors evaluate autonomic functions? What exactly is the autonomic and sensory rating scale used in the trial?</p>
              <p>Response: See Points 6 and 7 of the response to the Editor.</p>
              <p>4. The IMP used in this study seems to reverse the natural decline of ALSFRS-R overtime observed in ALS (without affecting objective measures like NFL or FVC). It is established that NFLs are stable throughout the disease, therefore NFL stabilization shown here was expected and it is not a "positive" result. Furthermore, benefit is prompt. Authors should discuss, somewhere in the discussion, the chance of a placebo effect.</p>
              <p>Response: The senior Clinical Investigator in this clinical trial has worked over many years with the biochemist (nowadays a neurologist) Lars Rosengren on studies of CSF biomarkers in ALS and, with others, they have found that the progress of disease in ALS is parallel to CSF and blood levels of Neurofilament Light Chain. Please see References 4 and 5 as examples. In addition to the work of the Clinical Investigator, there are numerous other publications describing the diagnostic and prognostic value of NfL in ALS (for example, see the review by Poesen K, Van Damme P. Diagnostic and Prognostic Performance of Neurofilaments in ALS. Front Neurol. 2019 Jan 18;9:1167. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2018.01167. PMID: 30713520; PMCID: PMC6345692). These publications all describe how the levels of NfL correlate with parameters of disease severity, such as the decline in the ALSFRS-R, and can be used to monitor disease progression. Hence, stabilization of NfL levels may be indicative of a ‘positive’ result.</p>
              <p>A placebo group is used in randomised controlled trials to control for the placebo effect and to more accurately determine the efficacy of a new treatment. However, it is also well known that a placebo might also be associated with negative effects (the nocebo effect). Interestingly, a strong nocebo effect has been noted in trials of drugs to treat patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, most recently reported in trials evaluating riluzole and edaravone, drugs which have a partially overlapping mechanism of action to ILB® evaluated here. For unknown reasons, the nocebo effect seems to be stronger in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis than in other neurological disorders (see Rato ML, Duarte GS, Mestre T, de Carvalho M, Ferreira JJ. Strong nocebo effects in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis trials might mask conclusions. Lancet Neurol. 2018 Oct;17(10):842. doi: 10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30310-7. Epub 2018 Sep 18. PMID: 30264722) which could, in theory, mask the beneficial effects of ILB®. As the reviewer suggests, we have included a short section on potential placebo effects in patients with ALS in the Discussion on Pages 34-35 Lines 590-595.</p>
              <p>5. Accordingly, why did not the authors evaluate QoL at day 99?</p>
              <p>Response: The trial protocol indicates that QoL were not evaluated at Day 99 in order to minimise the research burden on this very sick cohort of patients.</p>

              <p>Ann Logan et al. A phase II open label clinical study of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ILB® for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</p>
              <p>Response to Editor and Reviewers</p>
              <p>We appreciate the further detailed and helpful comments of the reviewers that we have again considered carefully. We believe that the revisions we have made in response to these comments have answered their questions and improved the manuscript significantly.</p>
              <p>Editor</p>
              <p>Given that ALS is a heterogeneous disease, as the author mentions, I am less certain than the authors that their results indicate a positive response from all the treated patients. </p>
              <p>Response: We have tried to be extremely cautious in our interpretation of the efficacy data throughout. In this revised version of the manuscript, we have included new data regarding the apparent effects of ILB on disease progression by comparing expected versus actual changes in ALSFRS-R scores (new Table 7). We have also emphasized the limitations of this study, the potential for placebo effects and the fact that the results only indicate ‘potential’ as a treatment for ALS (Lines 603-609 and 717-723).</p>
              <p>The revision raises some additional issues:</p>
              <p>Major issues:</p>
              <p>1. As the authors emphasize, ALS is a heterogeneous disease. In fact, several previous studies have shown that the progression rate of ALSFRS-R is useful in predicting disease progression. Therefore, a clear explanation why the authors did not stratify the subjects using the progression rate of ALSFRS-R is necessary.</p>
              <p>Response: With the extremely small patient group stratification would not have been possible. However, as suggested we have now used the expected progression rate of the ALSFRS-R scores to expand Table 4 to provide more detail for individual patients on disease characteristics and expectations of disease progression rate during the study period (Table 4 in revised manuscript). Furthermore, we have derived the predicted ALSFRS-R score at key post-treatment intervals for each patient based on their pre-trial disease progression rates as described by Taylor et al., 2016 (new reference number 36). Table 7 now describes the predicted versus actual ALSFRS-R scores for each individual patient at Day 36 and 99, based on their pre-treatment rate of disease progression.</p>
              <p>While the added data indicate that ILB treatment does indeed slow the disease progression rate in all patients, our interpretation remains very cautious due to the limitations of this small study. </p>
              <p>2. Unfortunately, there is a lack of confidence in the overall ADL scores, as some subjects have an improvement in Norris score of more than 20 points despite a decrease in ALSFRS-R by more than 5 points in Fig 6. How should I interpret that?</p>
              <p>Response: Looking at Figure 6 it can be seen that just one patient (Patient 8) has a significant lack of correlation of the 2 scoring systems. While the Norris and ALSFRS-R scores do show a relatively good correlation, the two scoring systems reflect very different scoring parameters. Therefore, differences in the scores are not unexpected and should not be overinterpreted. Nevertheless, we have now removed Figure 6 from the manuscript and replaced it with new Table 7. As suggested by Reviewer 1 and the Editor, we have derived the predicted ALSFRS-R score at key post-treatment intervals for each patient based on their pre-trial disease progression rates as described by Taylor et al., 2016 (new reference number 36). Table 7 now describes the predicted versus actual ALSFRS-R scores for each individual patient at Day 36 and 99, based on their pre-treatment rate of disease progression. We believe that this new table better describes the changes experienced by each of the trial participants. </p>
              <p>3. If the authors ‘deliberately’ selected patients with different backgrounds as described in the response, it should be sufficiently described in the criteria for patient selection in Methods. A detailed explanation as for how the authors eliminated selection bias is needed.</p>
              <p>Response: The inclusion/exclusion criteria used for patient selection are described in detail in Table 1 of the Methods section. The heterogenous patient group we recruited reflects the fact that we ‘deliberately’ did NOT use any enrichment methods to obtain a more homogenous patient population but used the prevalent qualifying cases available in the clinic that carried out the clinical trial. </p>
              <p>4. If the ADL scale is unreliable due to the fact that it is an open-label trial and the results of quantitative motor function test do not exist, it is preferred not to mention too much about the efficacy of the drug.</p>
              <p>Response: The functional rating scales (ALSFRS-R and Norris) used in this trial are widely used in clinical trial settings. As mentioned previously, the open label nature of trial may indeed enhance possible placebo effects. However, placebo effects cannot explain the degree of change seen in this cohort of patients (see new reference number 41). Despite this, our interpretations regarding efficacy are very cautious, confined and tempered by the study limitations. </p>
              <p>5. Although dizziness and fatigue can be related to autonomic symptoms, it is not common to include them in the same category due to the wide range of mechanisms. </p>
              <p>Response: We have now recategorized these symptoms as non-motor, autonomic and sensory symptoms (Lines 316 and 321). </p>
              <p>Minor issue:</p>
              <p>1. In the table 4, the patient's number is different from the other descriptions.</p>
              <p>Response: We have corrected this in Table 4 of the manuscript so that patient number is consistent throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 3</p>
              <p>1. In table 1 please specify diagnosis of ALS as "definite" to uniform it to inclusion criteria in the text.</p>
              <p>Response: This has been specified in Table 1 as requested. </p>
              <p>2. As a general comment, after authors' description of single symptoms included among "sensory and autonomic" I would rather define them as "non motor" since insomnia is questionable as sensory or autonomic dysfunction.</p>
              <p>Response: This has been redefined as requested in the Methods section on Lines 316 and 321.</p>
              <p>NOTE: Please note that we have updated reference number 40.</p>

                <bold>Reviewer #2: Thank you for your response to my previous comments. I'm unclear why the sample size is what it is still. Why 15? Is it an absence of any SAEs or dropouts? With what power is one wanting to rule out a given rate of SAEs? Where is this stated a priori in the protocol? An aspiration is what one is looking for - it is not a measure of outcome - so this still remains missing. There is still on statistical hypothesis. Dynamite plots are well known as conveying less information that in a table not least as spread of data is hidden. Why not give actual data? And why not at the very least give n, mu and sd. This is a commonly accepted minimum, even if one does not accept the consensus of statisticians, presented in <ext-link xlink:href="https://simplystatistics.org/2019/02/21/dynamite-plots-must-die/" ext-link-type="uri">https://simplystatistics.org/2019/02/21/dynamite-plots-must-die/</ext-link> If I find Fig 6 unclear and simply a forest of bars that does not provide the evidence to support the text, other readers will too.

              <p>Ann Logan et al. A phase II open label clinical study of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ILB® for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</p>
              <p>Response to Editor and Reviewer #2</p>
              <p>Editor</p>
              <p>We have appreciated the detailed and helpful comments of the reviewers that we have considered carefully throughout the revision process, but we were surprised to receive a fourth round of comments after such a protracted review period. We understand that it is usually desirable to achieve ‘sign off’ from all reviewers but perceive that this may be unobtainable with Reviewer #2. As further comment, some of the authors are very experienced long-standing researchers including one who is acknowledged as amongst the World’s Most Highly Cited Authors and an Editor-in-Chief of a leading pharmacology journal, yet the precedence of a fourth round of comments is new to all of the authors. Nevertheless, we are happy to hear that we have indeed addressed all of their previous concerns relayed to us in our revised manuscript (version 3) and here we once again try to address the further concerns of Reviewer #2. </p>
              <p>We are dismayed by the misleading comments by Reviewer #2 who seems to disregard (or be unaware of) the current clinical trial design and reporting recommendations accepted by your journal (see details below). Although we believe that it is unnecessary, please let us know if you wish us to include the extra paragraph on methodology set out below (yellow highlighted section). With the offer to insert the extra paragraph if considered necessary, we hope the Editor is now in a position to make a final judgement on our submission.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2</p>
              <p>1. Thank you for your response to my previous comments. I'm unclear why the sample size is what it is still. Why 15? Is it an absence of any SAEs or dropouts? </p>
              <p>Response: The protocol planned for 15 patients to be recruited into the clinical trial. This report describes the accumulated data from the first 13 patients recruited into the clinical trial, that was halted early due to the drug’s confirmed safety profile as there were no SAE or dropouts during the study (as clearly described in the clinical trial results and in the paper, see Tables). </p>
              <p>This trial is a phase II exploratory trial (see protocol at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/SE#A" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2017-005065-47/SE#A</ext-link>). The main aims were to explore the safety of the drug in the target population (phase I data already available in a healthy population) and identify potential for therapeutic efficacy of this new treatment for ALS. The results of this exploratory trial will contribute to the informed design of a phase III trial if/when applicable. </p>
              <p>Presumably being well versed in clinical trial methodology, Reviewer #2 is probably well aware that, due to the lack of information on effect sizes, formal power and sample size calculations for phase II trials are difficult and there is no consensus regarding the best methodology.

              <p>The issue is even more complex for such exploratory (or pilot studies) when the disease is a rare disease such as ALS. Hence the recommendation of the SPIRIT 2013 statement for clinical trial design:</p>
              <p>An-Wen Chan et al., SPIRIT 2013 explanation and elaboration: guidance for protocols of clinical trials. BMJ Research Methods and Reporting. BMJ 2013;346:e7586 doi: 10.1136/bmj.e7586 </p>
              <p>This publication accepts that circumstances can dictate that sample size is not derived by statistical calculations. It was this principle that led to the acceptance of the empirically chosen n=15 by the ethics committee who approved the ALS clinical trial described. Additionally, the n=15 satisfies the recommendations of Julious (see reference above) for exploratory trials (minimum recommended n=12; paper attached). The lack of a formal power analysis and sample size calculation is clearly stated i.n our paper (lines 347-348) as recommended by the SPIRIT 2013 statement.</p>
              <p>In our submitted paper we endeavour to describe the trial (from design to completion) with honesty and integrity without trying to embellish the findings with post-hoc power analyses of doubtful value. See:</p>
              <p>Yiran Zhang et al., Post hoc power analysis: is it an informative and meaningful analysis? Zhang Y, et al. General Psychiatry 2019;32:e100069. doi:10.1136/gpsych-2019-100069 </p>
              <p>However, we understand that Reviewer #2 does not want to allow publication of the study without power calculations and sample size estimates. Therefore, we believe it is an editorial decision whether the following paragraph should be included at the end of our statistical analysis: </p>
              <p>“The trial is a phase II exploratory trial. There was no formal sample size estimate or power calculation. The sample size was determined empirically and reflects the exploratory nature of the trial and the rarity of ALS (which is an orphan disease; Chan et al., SPIRIT 2013 statement1). However, at the insistence of the reviewers and editor we have explored whether the trial design would have been admissible using validated approaches to phase II clinical trial design (Jung et al2 and Lin et al3). For design assumptions in this exploration we did NOT use the actual outcome of the trial but relied on what was known in the literature about ALS trial outcomes at the time (high placebo effect and acceptable SAE rate for riluzole) which would have been a reasonable, albeit ambitious, expectation for a new drug. Fleming’s two-stage design (Jung et al2) was used (software made available by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, <ext-link xlink:href="http://cancer.unc.edu/biostatistics/program/ivanova/FlemingsTwoStageDesign.aspx" ext-link-type="uri">http://cancer.unc.edu/biostatistics/program/ivanova/FlemingsTwoStageDesign.aspx</ext-link> ) with the following assumptions: the null hypothesis that the response rate is 0.3 (based on the observed placebo effect in ALS trials). The drug will be regarded as good if the desirable effect (positive response = at least no decline in ALSFRS score) is observed in at least 70% of the patients. We expect the type I error rate of 0.05 and 80% power when the positive response rate is 0.7. The results of the analysis are summarised in Table X below. </p>
              <p>Table X. Exploration of trial design and power calculations. Where n is the total number of subjects; n1 is the number of subjects accrued during stage 1; a1, if a1 or fewer responses are observed during stage 1, the trial is stopped early for futility; b1, if b1 or more responses are observed during stage 1, the trial is stopped early and H0 is rejected; a2, if a2 or fewer responses are observed by the end of stage two, then no further investigation of the drug is warranted; b2, b2 = a2 + 1, if b2 or more responses are observed by the end of stage two, H0 is rejected; EN0 is the expected sample size for the trial when response rate is 0.3; EN1 is the expected sample size for the trial when response rate is 0.7. </p>

              <p>From Table X above it is clear that a trial design including a total of 15 patients is adequate to test the possible efficacy of the drug. It is also clear that stopping the trial early, when 13 patients were recruited did not affect the power of the trial. </p>
              <p>Using the BOP2: Bayesian Optimal Phase II Design software (available from the University of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.trialdesign.org/one-page-shell.html#BOP2" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.trialdesign.org/one-page-shell.html#BOP2</ext-link> ; Lin et al3) we have checked the validity of our design with one interim analysis allowed. The expectations for efficacy outcome were the same as described above (placebo effect: 30% positive outcome, accepted good drug effect: 70% positive outcome). Additionally, the accepted maximum rate for SAE was 5% (observed with Riluzol (Bensimon et al4) for the null hypothesis. The expectation was that with ILB® we have no SAE (stated stopping criteria 1 patient with SAE possibly related to the drug). We also assume that the efficacy and toxicity of the drug are not related and expect a type I error rate at or below 0.05. With these assumptions and with a maximum of 13 patient enrolled, the results of the 10000 simulations are shown in Table Y below. The power of this trial would be: 0.814. </p>

              <p>2. With what power is one wanting to rule out a given rate of SAEs? Where is this stated a priori in the protocol? </p>
              <p>Response: It is stated in the clinical trial protocol and in the paper that no power calculations were performed. For additional detail see above. </p>
              <p>3. An aspiration is what one is looking for - it is not a measure of outcome - so this still remains missing. </p>
              <p>Response: The ‘aspiration’ of the phase II exploratory trial is to ‘explore’, rather than set expectations out of thin air. The reviewer is setting expectations that are fit for a phase III trial and does not seem to be fully aware of the current clinical trial design and reporting recommendations accepted by the journal (see SPIRIT 2013 statement). </p>
              <p>4. There is still on (sic: no?) statistical hypothesis. </p>
              <p>Response: That is correct. There is no statistical hypothesis because there is no need for it in a phase II trial (see above). </p>
              <p>5. Dynamite plots are well known as (sic: for?) conveying less information that (sic: than?) in (sic: is the in necessary?) a table not least as (sic: because the?) spread of data is hidden. Why not give actual data? And why not at the very least give n, mu and sd. This is a commonly accepted minimum, even if one does not accept the consensus of statisticians, presented in <ext-link xlink:href="https://simplystatistics.org/2019/02/21/dynamite-plots-must-die/" ext-link-type="uri">https://simplystatistics.org/2019/02/21/dynamite-plots-must-die/</ext-link> . If I find Fig 6 unclear and simply a forest of bars that does not provide the evidence to support the text, other readers will too. The issue is to provide the evidence not aesthetic beauty.</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>5.1. The comment above is written in poor English and lacks clarity. It certainly falls short of the expectations of a quality peer review. </p>
              <p>5.2. The link (given as a reference regarding the quality of dynamite plots) is from a 2019 twitter post of Prof Rafael Irizarry. The link does not lead to an active page (Error message: “404 File not found, The site configured at this address does not contain the requested file” checked on the 13/12/2021). Perhaps in peer reviews it would be better to use references that the reviewer has actually read – a catchy title from a famous statistician may not necessarily mean “consensus of statisticians”. Journal articles or book chapters may be a better source for scientific guidance to authors than unchecked links lifted from old twitter posts. </p>
              <p>5.3. It is only Figures 4 and 5 that contain cumulative data from the 13 patients. Both graphs give the mean and standard deviation of the group (which is clearly labelled on the graphs) as expected by the reviewer. The n number is 13 as stated several times in the paper. The actual data included in these figures are given in Tables 7 and 8 for each individual patient. So, the “why not give actual data?” and “why not at the very least give n, mu and sd” can only refer to Figure 6. </p>
              <p>5.4. While it is great to hear that Figure 6 was aesthetically pleasing, we must inform the Reviewer and Editor that this figure was removed from the last submitted revised version of the paper and replaced by Table 7 containing the actual numerical data. </p>
              <p>5.5. It may be worth noting that Figure 6 was NOT a dynamite plot anyway. Figure 6 was “Comparison of ALSFRS-R and Norris scores for individual patients at Visit 2 (V2 at Day 1; prior to first ILB® injection) and Visit 7 (V7 at Day 36; 7 days after last ILB® injection)”. So, it was the actual individual scores of patients measured at the two identified time points. There was nothing hidden, the graph contained the actual data from the patients rather than cumulative means. This was made clear in title and legend of the figure. While one would hope that an average reader would read at least the title of the figure before bemoaning the lack of ‘evidence’, the figure was replaced by Table 7 that is ‘less aesthetically pleasing’ but is clear even to the most superficial reader.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Logan,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting the latest version your manuscript to PLOS ONE and for including the new information about sample size. As you will see from the statistical referee's comments below, he is asking about the justification for the choice of 70% for patients showing a positive response. When and why was this cutoff chosen? Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses this point.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Apr 07 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list><!-- <div> -->If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>

The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>
