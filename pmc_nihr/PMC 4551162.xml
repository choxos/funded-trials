               unfavourable outcome in both colon and rectal cancer. This study suggests that a
               single-nucleotide polymorphism of the KRAS gene (LCS-6 variant) may predict response
               to neoadjuvant treatment and mitigate the poor prognosis associated with KRAS
               mutation in locally advanced rectal cancer.BackgroundLethal-7 (let-7) is a tumour suppressor miRNA which acts by down-regulating
                  several oncogenes including KRAS. A single-nucleotide
                  polymorphism (rs61764370, T > G base substitution) in the let-7 complementary
                  site 6 (LCS-6) of KRAS mRNA has been shown to predict prognosis
                  in early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and benefit from anti-epidermal growth
                  factor receptor monoclonal antibodies in metastatic CRC.Patients and methodsWe analysed rs61764370 in EXPERT-C, a randomised phase II trial of neoadjuvant
                  CAPOX followed by chemoradiotherapy, surgery and adjuvant CAPOX plus or minus
                  cetuximab in locally advanced rectal cancer. DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed
                  paraffin-embedded tumour tissue and genotyped using a PCR-based commercially
                  available assay. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used
                  to calculate survival estimates and compare treatment arms.ResultsA total of 155/164 (94.5%) patients were successfully analysed, of whom 123
                  (79.4%) and 32 (20.6%) had the LCS-6 TT and LCS-6 TG genotype,
                  respectively. Carriers of the G allele were found to have a statistically
                  significantly higher rate of complete response (CR) after neoadjuvant therapy

                <p>KRAS mutation has been reported as a marker of radio-resistance in rectal cancer and
unfavourable outcome in both colon and rectal cancer. This study suggests that a

                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Lethal-7 (let-7) is a tumour suppressor miRNA which acts by down-regulating
several oncogenes including <italic>KRAS</italic>. A single-nucleotide
polymorphism (rs61764370, T &gt; G base substitution) in the let-7 complementary
site 6 (LCS-6) of <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNA has been shown to predict prognosis
in early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and benefit from anti-epidermal growth
factor receptor monoclonal antibodies in metastatic CRC.</p>

                  <p>We analysed rs61764370 in EXPERT-C, a randomised phase II trial of neoadjuvant
CAPOX followed by chemoradiotherapy, surgery and adjuvant CAPOX plus or minus
cetuximab in locally advanced rectal cancer. DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tumour tissue and genotyped using a PCR-based commercially
available assay. Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method and Cox regression analysis were used
to calculate survival estimates and compare treatment arms.</p>

(79.4%) and 32 (20.6%) had the LCS-6 TT and LCS-6 TG genotype,
respectively. Carriers of the G allele were found to have a statistically
significantly higher rate of complete response (CR) after neoadjuvant therapy
(28.1% versus 10.6%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.020) and a trend
for better 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) [77.4% versus
64.5%: hazard ratio (HR) 0.56; <italic>P</italic> = 0.152] and
overall survival (OS) rates (80.3% versus 71.9%: HR 0.59;
<italic>P</italic> = 0.234). Both CR and survival outcomes were
independent of the use of cetuximab. The negative prognostic effect associated
with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation appeared to be stronger in patients with the
LCS-6 TT genotype (HR PFS 1.70, <italic>P</italic> = 0.078; HR OS 1.79,

              <p>miRNAs are short, non-coding, sequences of nucleotides which regulate gene expression by
binding to complementary sites in the 3‚Ä≤-untranslated region (3‚Ä≤UTRs) of
target mRNAs [<xref rid="MDV285C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 2000 miRNAs
have been described in humans so far and mounting evidence suggests that these molecules
may play an important role in the mechanisms of cell proliferation, differentiation,
carcinogenesis, tumour progression and response to treatment [<xref rid="MDV285C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="MDV285C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>The lethal-7 (let-7) family members are among the most studied miRNAs in human
malignancies. They generally act as tumour suppressors by down-regulating oncogenes
involved in the control of the cell cycle or intracellular signalling cascades [<xref rid="MDV285C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>KRAS</italic> is an established
target of let-7, several complementary sites for this miRNA being described in the
3‚Ä≤UTR of the mRNA [<xref rid="MDV285C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs61764370, T &gt; G base substitution) in the
let-7 complementary site 6 (LCS-6) has been reported in ‚àº18% of Caucasians
with colorectal cancer (CRC) [<xref rid="MDV285C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This
polymorphism modifies the let-7 binding affinity for <italic>KRAS</italic> ultimately
leading to reduced <italic>KRAS</italic> inhibition and increased tumour proliferation
[<xref rid="MDV285C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>A number of studies investigated the role of the LCS-6 variant either as a prognostic
marker in early CRC or as a predictive marker for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) therapies in metastatic CRC [<xref rid="MDV285C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="MDV285C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="MDV285C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The results have been largely inconsistent possibly due to a significant
inter-study heterogeneity with regard to sample size, patient characteristics and
treatment. Notably, although the prognostic relevance of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation
appears greater in rectal cancer compared with colon cancer [<xref rid="MDV285C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="MDV285C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], studies
addressing the role of this polymorphism in a homogeneous series of rectal cancer
patients are lacking.</p>
              <p>We analysed the LCS-6 variant in EXPERT-C, an international, multicentre, randomised
phase II trial investigating the addition of cetuximab to a sequential treatment with
neoadjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by chemo-radiotherapy (CRT),
surgery and adjuvant CAPOX in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) [<xref rid="MDV285C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

extramural vascular invasion [<xref rid="MDV285C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Patients

surgery and four cycles of adjuvant CAPOX or the same treatment plus cetuximab (Figure

58) while 32 (20.6%) had the LCS-6 TG genotype (CAPOX = 13; CAPOX-C
= 19). Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium was observed (<italic>P</italic> =
0.152). There was no association between the LCS-6 genotype and baseline characteristics
including demographics and clinico-pathological features. More patients in the LCS-6
variant group had tumours harbouring <italic>KRAS</italic> (54.8% versus
41.5%), <italic>KRAS/NRAS</italic> (58.1% versus 45.8%) and
<italic>BRAF</italic> mutation (6.5% versus 1.7%). These differences
however were not statistically significant.</p>
              <p>After neoadjuvant treatment, 13/123 patients (10.6%) in the LCS-6 TT genotype
group achieved CR compared with 9/32 (28.1%) in the LCS-6 TG genotype group
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.020, adjusted <italic>P</italic> = 0.044). In
both groups, no significant differences in CR rate were observed with or without
cetuximab (10.3% versus 10.8%, <italic>P</italic> = 1.00 and
31.6% versus 23.1%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.704, respectively,

group were observed in the entire population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDV285F2">2</xref>). In cetuximab-treated patients, survival outcomes were independent of the
genotype group. The 5-year PFS and OS rates in patients with the LCS-6 TT genotype
treated in the CAPOX-C arm were 66.7% and 77.0%, respectively, compared
with 62.7% and 67.4% in patients with the same genotype treated in the
CAPOX arm [HR PFS 0.78 (95% CI 0.43‚Äì1.42) <italic>P</italic> =

The 5-year PFS and OS rates in patients with the LCS-6 TG genotype treated in the
CAPOX-C arm were 78.9% and 83.9%, respectively, compared with 75.0%
and 75.0% in patients with the same genotype treated in the CAPOX arm [HR PFS

              <p>Thirty-one patients (25.2%) in the LCS-6 TT genotype group and 5 patients
(15.6%) in the LCS-6 TG genotype group had tumour recurrence. The most common
sites of disease recurrence were liver (41.7%), lung (44.4%), peritoneum
(19.4%) and lymph nodes (16.7%). The rate of liver relapse was different
between the two groups: 15 patients out of 123 (12.2%) in the LCS-6 TT genotype
group were diagnosed with liver metastases (accounting for 48.4% of all relapsed
patients in this group) compared with 0/32 patients with the LCS-6 TG genotype

              <p>When the survival outcomes were analysed by <italic>KRAS</italic> status, the prognostic

              <p>In this retrospective analysis of the EXPERT-C trial, we showed that rs61764370 was not
a predictive factor for cetuximab in LARC. However, this polymorphic variant was
associated with a higher rate of CR to neoadjuvant therapy and a trend towards better
survival outcomes, especially in the subgroup of patients with <italic>KRAS</italic>
mutant tumours.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first report on the role of the LCS-6 variant in a
homogeneous series of LARC. Previous studies investigating this SNP were either
restricted to patients with colon cancer or conducted in unselected CRC populations
[<xref rid="MDV285C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="MDV285C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="MDV285C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However,
differences exist between colon and rectal cancers with regards to tumour biology and
treatment approach including frequency of microsatellite instability and
<italic>BRAF</italic> mutation, prognostic relevance of <italic>KRAS</italic>
mutation, miRNA expression profile and routine use of radiotherapy in LARC [<xref rid="MDV285C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>We assessed the role of the LCS-6 variant with an aim to validate two intriguing
hypotheses generated by previous analyses. The first hypothesis is that this variant may
predict benefit from anti-EGFR agents and refine the selection of metastatic CRC
patients who are candidate for these therapies [<xref rid="MDV285C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The second hypothesis is that the LCS-6 G allele may be a favourable
prognostic factor in the non-metastatic setting and be used in the decision-making
process regarding adjuvant treatment [<xref rid="MDV285C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
To this end, we used a prospective series of LARC patients who were treated with
systemic chemotherapy followed by CRT plus or minus cetuximab in a randomised phase II
trial [<xref rid="MDV285C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>The incidence of the LCS-6 variant in our population was in line with what has been
previously reported [<xref rid="MDV285C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="MDV285C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We could not find an association between
this polymorphism and patient characteristics. Of note, our study is the first to
include data on <italic>RAS</italic> (<italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic>,
exon 2‚Äì4) mutation in this setting and, although a higher incidence of
<italic>RAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation was observed in carriers of
the G allele, this was not statistically significant.</p>
              <p>The main and novel finding of our analysis is that patients with the LCS-6 TG genotype
had a higher rate of CR after preoperative treatment. This translated into numerically
higher, but not statistically significantly improved, survival outcomes possibly due to
the relatively small sample size, the low number of events and the limited statistical
power of the study. Of note, the better prognosis of the LCS-6 variant group was
independent of cetuximab. These results do not confirm, at least in the setting of LARC,
an association between LCS-6 genotype and benefit from anti-EGFR agents. However, they
suggest that the LCS-6 variant may act as a prognostic factor possibly by modulating the
cytotoxic effects of CRT. In support of this contention, preclinical studies showed that
the expression of let-7 changed in response to irradiation. Moreover, manipulating the
expression of specific let-7 miRNAs was associated with radiosensitivity (i.e. when
increasing let-7a or let-7b levels) or radio-resistance (i.e. when reducing let-7 g
levels) in <italic>RAS</italic> mutant pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines [<xref rid="MDV285C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="MDV285C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We acknowledge that our results are hypothesis-generating. A better
understanding of the relationship between let-7 and radiotherapy as well as validation
of our findings in independent series is certainly needed. Also, it should be noted that
both treatment arms of the EXPERT-C trial were investigational in that oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy was administered before CRT. Given the absence of a control group treated
with standard fluoropyrimidine-based CRT only, we cannot rule out that the improved
outcome of the G carriers could be secondary to increased sensitivity to induction
systemic chemotherapy. In this regard, it has been previously shown that, in tumour
cells harbouring the LCS-6 variant allele, the functional effects of chemotherapy (as
measured by KRAS expression) were different among cytotoxic agents [<xref rid="MDV285C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>In subgroup analyses by <italic>KRAS</italic> status, we observed that the favourable
prognostic effect of the LCS-6 variant was limited to patients with
<italic>KRAS</italic> mutant tumours. Interestingly, this finding is consistent with
previous reports. In early-stage CRC patients, Smits et al. showed that G carriers with
stage I‚ÄìII tumours harbouring <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation had a better
cancer-specific survival compared with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant patients with the
LCS-6 TT genotype [<xref rid="MDV285C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast,
patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type tumours had intermediate prognosis
regardless of the LCS-6 genotype. An association between LCS-6 G allele and better
prognosis was also reported in a series of stage III‚ÄìIV CRC patients enriched with
<italic>KRAS</italic> mutation [<xref rid="MDV285C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
Finally, in a recent analysis of the NCCTG N0147 trial, the outcome of G carriers with
<italic>KRAS</italic> mutant stage III colon cancer appeared to be more similar to
that of patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type tumours than that of patients with
LCS-6 TT genotype and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant tumour [<xref rid="MDV285C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Altogether, these data seem to indicate that the LCS-6
variant may mitigate the unfavourable prognosis associated with <italic>KRAS</italic>
mutation in the non-metastatic setting [<xref rid="MDV285C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="MDV285C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It has been proposed that this
effect may be secondary to induction of cellular senescence through overexpression of
KRAS and increased signalling through the MAP-K cascade [<xref rid="MDV285C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there are currently no data to confirm this
hypothesis and the broad spectrum of cancer-related genes which are regulated by let-7
suggests that other mechanisms may be involved.</p>
              <p>We recognise the limitations of our study including the retrospective design, the small
numbers and the analysis of patients who were treated with investigational therapeutic
strategies that do not reflect the current standard of care in this setting. Moreover,
robust biological hypotheses to explain the study results are lacking. However, this
analysis explores for the first time the predictive and prognostic role of the LCS-6
variant in LARC and provides another piece of the puzzle on the relationship between
this SNP and anti-EGFR agents.</p>
              <p>The management of LARC is orphan of established biomarkers that could lead to
optimisation of patient selection, implementation of molecularly selected treatment
approaches and improved outcomes. So far, studies investigating putative biomarkers in
this setting have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, conventional
clinico-pathological prognostic factors still remain the only available tools for
individual patient risk assessment and treatment decision. Although genetic variations
associated with SNPs have been reported to influence cancer risk, response to treatment
and tumour prognosis in a number of tumour types including CRC, their value in routine
practice is yet to be demonstrated.</p>
              <p>Our analysis suggests that, in a Caucasian population, the rs61764370 SNP may influence
the prognostic relevance of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation which has been increasingly
reported as a marker of resistance to CRT in LARC and poor prognosis in distal colon
cancer and rectal cancer [<xref rid="MDV285C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="MDV285C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. If our findings are confirmed, testing
for <italic>KRAS</italic> and rs61764370 could potentially provide useful data for
patient stratification in clinical trials of (neo)adjuvant treatment of LARC. Further
studies to elucidate the mechanisms whereby this SNP may increase tumour
(chemo)radiosensitivity and mitigate the unfavourable prognosis of <italic>KRAS</italic>
mutant tumours are warranted.</p>
