                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Around 25% of patients with bladder cancer (BCa) present with invasive disease. Non-randomised studies of population-based screening have suggested reductions in BCa-specific mortality are possible through earlier detection. The low prevalence of lethal disease in the general population means screening is not cost-effective and there is no consensus on the best strategy. Yorkshire has some of the highest mortality rates from BCa in England. We aim to test whether population screening in a region of high mortality risk will lead to a downward stage-migration of aggressive BCa, improved survival and is cost-effective.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>YORKSURe is a tiered, randomised, multicohort study to test the feasibility of a large BCa screening randomised controlled trial. In three parallel cohorts, participants will self-test urine (at home) up to six times. Results are submitted via a mobile app or freephone. Those with a positive result will be invited for further investigation at community-based early detection clinics or within usual National Health Service (NHS) pathways. In Cohort 1, we will post self-testing kits to research engaged participants (n=2000) embedded within the Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial. In Cohort 2, we will post self-testing kits to 3000 invitees. Cohort 2 participants will be randomised between haematuria and glycosuria testing using a reveal/conceal design. In Cohort 3, we will post self-testing kits to 500 patients within the NHS pathway for investigation of haematuria. Our primary outcomes are rates of recruitment and randomisation, rates of positive test and acceptability of the design. The study is currently recruiting and scheduled to finish in June 2023.</p>

              <p>Bladder cancer (BCa) is a common malignancy and one of the most expensive to manage.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> BCas are best stratified into non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle invasive (MI) cancers. In the UK, around 25% of patients present with MI BCa which requires radical treatment in an attempt at cure.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> BCa rates increase with age, smoking and occupational carcinogen exposure.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â7</xref> Consequently, BCa incidence and mortality demographics often match local risk factor patterns of exposure. Yorkshire has some of the highest incidence and mortality rates of BCa in England, perhaps reflecting lifestyle choices and local industries.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 8â10</xref></p>
              <p>In contrast to many human malignancies, disease-specific survival for BCa is not improving,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 11</xref> suggesting a need to change the approach to manage this cancer. Many BCaâs present late to healthcare professionals as the symptoms mirror those of common benign conditions, such as bacterial cystitis, detrusor overactivity or prostatic enlargement.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Within the NHS, more BCas are diagnosed following routine General practitioner (GP) referral (41.3% (CI: 40.7% to 42.0%)) for urinary symptoms than via 2 week-wait (2ww) pathways (27.5% (CI: 26.9% to 28.1%)), and the rate of emergency presentation increases with advancing tumour stage, from 6.4% for NMI to 18.8% for MI BCas.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>

                <title>Current knowledge: BCa early detection</title>
                <p>Most BCas are diagnosed in persons with visible haematuria (VH) or non-visible haematuria (NVH).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As such, there is potential to use haematuria to detect asymptomatic disease earlier than would occur otherwise.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Indeed, patient surveys reveal many individuals complain of irritative bladder symptoms (dysuria, frequency) prior to developing VH.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> However, there have been few attempts at screening for BCa using haematuria. Two non-randomised single arm studies found that haematuria testing in asymptomatic persons leads to earlier stage of cancers at detection and may improve survival.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Britton <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> screened 2356 British men and found 17 BCas, of which all were NMI.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> At 7 years, 33% of the high-grade NMI cohort had died from BCa, reflecting potential undermanagement of this aggressive cancer.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Messing <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> screened 1575 American men and found a lower stage at diagnosis, with reduced BCa mortality rate (0%) in screened men compared with rates in men from a matching state-wide registry (16.4% mortality rate).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The authors concluded that screening did reduce mortality, but it needs to be applied in high-risk populations and that haematuria is intermittent in patients with BCa.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In populations exposed to aristolochic acid, Zlotta <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> found survival (0% mortality) occurred only with screening (100% mortality in non-screened patients),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> supporting the potential for BCa screening to be cost-effective in high-risk populations.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>

                <title>Research need</title>
                <p>YORKSURe is a feasibility trial aimed at the early diagnosis of BCa through the detection of haematuria in asymptomatic individuals at high risk of mortality from the cancer. Following results of the feasibility trial, the aim is to conduct a large-scale trial, with sufficient power to test any differences in BCa mortality. However, to undertake this successfully, we need to understand if our proposed approach is robust, appropriate, necessary and acceptable to participants. Here we detail the trail using Protocol V.5.0 date 16 January 2023.</p>

                <p>Participants in all three cohorts will be provided with home urine self-testing kits produced and supplied by Testcard. The kit contains 6Ã Roche Combur 5 HC test strips for the graduated determination of glucose, leucocytes, nitrites, protein and erythrocytes. Blood and glucose will be tested for primary study purposes. The other three parameters (leukocytes, nitrite, protein) will be analysed as part of an exploratory objective.</p>
                <p>Participants will record six continuous days of test strip results via a bespoke study App or study freephone service. Prior to commencing self-testing, participants will complete a bladder symptom questionnaire (a modified and unvalidated version of the Urinary Tract Infection Symptom Assessment (UTISA) Questionnaire).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The questionnaire will collect demographic data and information on bladder symptoms within the past 4 weeks including presence of VH. The questionnaire will be pseudonymised and all data pertaining to the questionnaire will be kept separate from urine self-testing results until the end of the trial. The app will capture a digital photograph of the test strip, which will be interpreted by a research nurse against the Roche Combur 5 HC colour chart. Test strip results will not be available to participants at the point of self-testing.</p>
                <p>It is anticipated and expected that some participants in the study population will either not have a smartphone, or will not be confident in using a mobile App. A study freephone service will therefore be available as an alternative option for recording self-test results. The freephone service will be an automated system whereby participants use their keypad to enter their responses to the questionnaire and test strip results. The freephone service requires confirmation of the test strip colour result by the participant against the Roche Combur 5 HC colour chart, whereas App users will simply take a photograph of their completed test strip which will be submitted for interpretation by a research nurse.</p>

                <p>Participants in Cohort 1 and those randomised to the haematuria arm of Cohort 2 will be investigated for the presence of haematuria (<xref rid="F1 F2" ref-type="fig">figures 1 and 2</xref>). If a single positive result is identified on research nurse review of the erythrocyte test parameter, then the participant will be invited to attend an Early Detection Clinic (run in a nearby GP surgery and staffed by study-employed or NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN)-employed nursing staff) within 4â6 weeks of assessment of their results. At this clinic, participants will undergo a urinary tract ultrasound scan (USS) and provide a urine sample for cytology. Those with an abnormal USS (bladder or renal mass suggestive of cancer detected) or abnormal cytology will be referred by their GP or the research nurse team (following standard NHS 2ww criteria) to their local urology haematuria service for evaluation (flexible cystoscopy and additional assessments). We expect that around 20% of participants with self-testing haematuria will require referral. The test results for these participants will be obtained directly through the relevant urology departments and categorised into: BCa diagnosis, kidney cancer diagnosis, upper tract urothelial cancer diagnosis, urinary stones, infection or inflammation, stricture, clinically benign prostatic enlargement, post-TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), diagnosis unclear/further tests planned, likely prostate cancer, no abnormal finding or other finding. Participants with normal USS and normal cytology, from the early detection clinic, will receive a letter explaining this and discharging them from the study. They will receive advice about the need to see their GP if they have urinary symptoms or VH. Their GP will receive a letter with advice about management of NVH. Participants without haematuria will receive a letter confirming their result and informed that their GP will also be notified of their results. They will be asked to seek a GP appointment if they develop urinary symptoms in the future. Participants in cohort 3 will undergo standard NHS assessment of haematuria as part of their referral process (regardless of their test strip results). This includes cystoscopy and upper tract imaging (typically CT urogram and USS).</p>

Glycosuria was chosen as it is a validated urine test that can detect a meaningful disease (diabetes mellitus), whose outcomes are better detected at an early stage. If a single positive result is identified on research nurse review of the glucose test parameter, then the participant will be invited to attend an Early Detection Clinic within 4â6 weeks of assessment of their results. At the clinic, participants will undergo hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) blood testing. Those with elevated HbA1c (as defined by local reference ranges) will be referred to their GP for diabetic management. Those with a normal HbA1c (as defined by local reference ranges) will receive a letter explaining that their test was normal and will be advised to see their GP if they think they have diabetic symptoms. Their GP will also be informed of the test result. Participants in the glucosuria testing arm without glycosuria will receive a letter confirming their normal result and informed that their GP will also be notified of their results.

                <p>Exploratory outcomes include (1) Comparison of populations, demographics and cancer incidence in those who do/do not complete self-testing (comparing the characteristics where available including sex, age group, quintile of deprivation, smoking history). All participants who self-test will be flagged in National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) for cancer diagnoses at 1, 2 and 3 years following the end of the trial. (2) The development of an artificial intelligence (AI) platform for the assessment of urine samples for cytology analysis for the future study will be measured by the accuracy of the AI read versus the manual read at the end of the trial. (3) The potential harm of cystoscopy adverse effects, specifically urinary tract infections requiring medical treatment, will be measured by the proportions of participants who have a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) requiring medical treatment following cystoscopy at the end of the trial. (4) Development of a health economics model<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> using the information from this feasibility study that could be used to develop a future community-based screening programme for BCa will be measured at the end of the study by: (4.1) Resource usage in each arm (number of clinics used, blood tests, ultrasound tests, extra NHS tests); (4.2) Rate of cancers and other illnesses per arm. (5) The addition of other urinary contents (leucocytes, nitrate, protein) in relation to the risk prediction of BCa will be measured by other positive test strip panels in addition to haematuria at the end of the trial.</p>

Data for Cohort 1 and 2 participants who are subsequently referred for a 2ww, and consenting Cohort 3 participants, will be obtained via medical records to include results of cystoscopy, ultrasound/CT, cytology and cancer staging where applicable. At 14â30âdays post cystoscopy, these participants will be contacted to collect information of any treated incidences of UTI following cystoscopy. Passive follow-up data (identification of cancer diagnosis and stage) will be collected through the NCRAS at 1, 2 and 3 years after the end of the trial for all participants who have self-tested (excluding withdrawals).

We will estimate acceptability (proportion of invitees consenting and returning a test strip), compliance (proportion of participants returning at least three or all six test strips), haematuria and glucosuria, proportion of positive outcomes for those referred to the Early Detection Clinic (positive cytology and/or USS for haematuria and HbA1c for glycosuria). We will assess the levels of BCa in the cohort identified by Early Detection clinic and at 3âyears using National Disease Registration Service (NDRS, formerly NCRAS) and the accuracy of the haematuria test results including PPVs and NPVs for Cohorts 1 and 2 only. The urinary symptoms questionnaires will be summarised by cohort, by the proportions with each urinary symptom, and by overall urinary symptoms using mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum and quartiles.

The Trial Management Group meet at least monthly and will comprise the CI, representatives from University of Sheffield and CPTU who are responsible for day-to-day management of the trial and carrying out the work detailed in the trial protocol. The purpose of the group is to ensure the trial is on track to its project plan and budget, manage trial risks, issues and mitigations and to escalate and report any major risks and issues to the TSC as necessary.</p>
                <p>The TSC will concentrate on progress of the trial, adherence to the protocol, participant welfare and to assess the impact and relevance of any new information of relevance to the research question. The TSC will make recommendations, through its Chair, to the TMG, CI, trial sponsor, trial funders, CPTU and any other relevant party on all appropriate aspects of the trial. Most members of the TSC, including the Chair, will be independent of the trial, and will include lay/patient representation. Non-independent members will also be part of the TSC as observers. The final decision regarding whether the trial may continue is the responsibility of the TSC.</p>

                <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                <p>A risk assessment and review of ethical considerations has been performed as part of the trial, including development of mitigation strategies to ensure the safe and successful delivery of the trial. Key risks and mitigations from this trial have been outlined below:</p>
                <list list-type="order">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Cancer screening is in part controversial due to the risks of finding and over treating indolent cancers. However, for BCa there is minimal morbidity in diagnosis (ie, from the transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT)) and risk stratification is embedded in the treatment pathways. Many of these cancers are managed without radical treatment, and therefore there are few long-term side effects. Furthermore, autopsy studies<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> reveal few undiagnosed BCaâs, suggesting that most tumours present clinically. Modelling of the disease natural history will aim to estimate overdiagnosis and will provide input to subsequent trial design to provide definitive evidence on these issues.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Another risk is that participants may attempt to seek the same test outside of the trial or try to identify what the colour change on their urinary test strip represents. We have worked with PPI representatives to tailor trial communications. It is key that participants understand that participation in the trial should be seen as altruistic and there is currently no evidence to suggest that screening of this may be beneficial and indeed may cause harm. Liaison with local GPs throughout the pilot period will be key in determining if they observe any increase in men or women requesting urinalysis assessments.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Variable practices in secondary care for the treatment of BCa (ie, post study) is another risk. Treating clinicians may use a wide variety of different regimens) to manage screen detected cancers. As part of the planned future trial, we will apply for funding for an embedded cohort study of comparative effectiveness and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for these screen-detected cancers. Patients/clinicians will be able to choose from a selection of standard National Institute of Care Excellence approved pathways. HRQOL and cost will be collected within these pathways.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>To ensure widespread dissemination, we plan to circulate the trial results to multiple research outputs including but not limited to conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journal articles relating to the trial design, results of the pilot trial, final uptake of participants and a final main analysis of primary and secondary endpoints encompassing economic modelling aspects. All trials will be published in high-impact journals, accompanied by a press release. This will be covered in more detail in the trial publication policy. Dissemination of trial results will be designed and delivered after extensive collaboration with PPI groups.</p>
