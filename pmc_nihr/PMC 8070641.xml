                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Shortages of clinical staff make chronic asthma care challenging in low-income countries. We evaluated an outpatient asthma care package for children, including task-shifting of asthma management roles.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a non-blinded individually randomised controlled trial at a tertiary-level government hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Children aged 6–15 years diagnosed with asthma were recruited from outpatient clinic, stratified by Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT) score and allocated 1:1 from a concealed file, accessed during electronic questionnaire completion. The intervention, delivered by non-physicians, comprised clinical assessment, optimisation of inhaled treatment, individualised asthma education. The control group received standard care from outpatient physicians. Primary outcome for intention-to-treat analysis was change in cACT score at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included asthma exacerbations requiring emergency healthcare and school absence.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between September 2018 and December 2019, 120 children (59 intervention; 61 control) were recruited; 65.8% males, with mean (SD) age 9.8 (2.8) years, mean (SD) baseline cACT 20.3 (2.6). At 3 months, intervention children (n=56) had a greater mean (SD) change in cACT score from baseline (2.7 (2.8) vs 0.6 (2.8)) compared with standard care participants (n=59); a difference of 2.1 points (95% CI: 1.1 to 3.1, p&lt;0.001). Fewer intervention children attended emergency healthcare (7.3% vs 25.4%, p=0.02) and missed school (20.0% vs 62.7%, p&lt;0.001) compared with standard care children.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>The intervention resulted in decreased asthma symptoms and exacerbations. Wider scale-up could present substantial benefits for asthmatic patients in resource-limited settings.</p>

              <p>Asthma is the most common chronic condition in childhood and is a growing concern in Africa.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Asthma causes an estimated 1000 deaths worldwide every day and is a major cause of morbidity in children, ranking in the top 10 causes of disability-adjusted life years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Asthmatic adults in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) suffer frequent acute exacerbations and have symptoms that are poorly controlled.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Limited data from asthmatic children living in sSA suggest higher rates of severe symptoms compared with high-income settings, likely due to challenges with diagnosis and quality of asthma care.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
              <p>The Malawi Standard Treatment Guidelines for asthma management are extrapolated from global guidelines, adopting a stepwise approach centred on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> These guidelines are appropriate where steroid-responsive, allergen-driven, eosinophilic asthma predominates: it is unknown whether this is true for Malawi. Limited evaluation of asthma guideline implementation in selected low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) found that physicians often underutilise ICS treatment and that patient adherence to treatment is a challenge.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Reasons for poor adherence are likely to be multifactorial, including unreliable supplies of affordable medication and misconceptions regarding effective asthma treatments.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>

              <p>Asthma education and the use of an asthma action plan (AAP) are considered important elements of chronic asthma management in high-income countries (HIC) and are recommended in international guidelines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Studies demonstrating a beneficial impact of asthma education in HIC include a wide range of interventions, with variable content, duration and delivery methods.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> AAPs facilitate the early detection and treatment of an exacerbation and have been shown to improve asthma health outcomes in HIC.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, the provision of asthma education can be time-consuming and human resources constraints in Malawi limit the quality of care available. Task-shifting, defined as ‘the transfer of a task normally performed by a more highly trained healthcare worker to another with a different, usually lower level of training,’ is a possible solution, but research exploring this approach to asthma management in low-income countries (LIC) is lacking.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref>
</p>
              <p>We implemented a package of enhanced asthma care, appropriate for an LIC, delivered by non-physicians, which included a standardised clinical assessment, optimisation of locally available inhaled asthma treatment and personalised asthma education.</p>
              <p>We did a non-blinded, individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effects of the enhanced asthma care package with standard outpatient care, on asthma outcomes over a 3-month period.</p>

              <p>Most children (106/120, 88.3%) reported wheezing in the past year; overall, 68.3% (82/120) experienced ISAAC-defined severe asthma symptoms, with at least one of; ≥4 attacks (64/106, 60.4%), wheeze-related sleep disturbance more than once per week (34/106, 32.1%) or wheeze affecting speech (38/106, 35.8%), in the past year. By GINA criteria, asthma symptoms were well controlled in 19 (15.8%), partly controlled in one-third (41/120) and uncontrolled in half (60/120) of the participants. The baseline mean (SD) cACT score was 20.3 (2.6), with 43 (35.8%) participants stratified as having poor control (cACT ≤19) and 77 (64.2%) with good control (cACT ≥20) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table S3</xref>).</p>
              <p>At enrolment, 96/120 (80.0%) participants reported using a salbutamol inhaler, with 67/96 (69.8%) using a spacer; 41/120 (34.1%) participants reported using a beclometasone inhaler (plus spacer) regularly, with a mean daily dose of 258 µg and self-reported adherence of 89.6%.</p>
              <p>None of the participants had been previously treated for TB. Of 105/120 participants who had been tested for HIV, all were HIV-negative. Half of the participants (62/120, 51.7%) reported a family history of asthma, including 47/120 (39.2%) with asthma in a first-degree relative. The majority of participants experienced wheezing in early childhood; 52/120 (43.3%) reported wheeze onset before age 3 years, 41/120 (34.2%) aged 3–6 years and 27/120 (22.5%) after age 6 years. Atopic symptoms were common, with self-reported rhinitis, hay fever and eczema in 72/120 (60.0%), 37/120 (30.8%) and 31/120 (25.8%), respectively.</p>
              <p>At 3 months, children in the intervention arm had a mean (SD) cACT of 22.9 (2.3), compared with 20.8 (3.0) in standard care (p&lt;0.001). Children receiving the intervention had a greater mean (SD) change in cACT score from baseline; 2.7 (2.8) compared with 0.6 (2.8) for standard care participants, a difference of 2.1 points (95% CI: 1.1 to 3.1, p&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). On stratified analysis, overall those with baseline ACT ≤19 showed greater change in mean (SD) cACT than those with baseline ACT ≥20 (2.9 (3.3) vs 0.9 (2.5), p&lt;0.001): this was true for both intervention and standard care groups (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Participants receiving the intervention reported improvement in symptoms and GINA score, with little change for those receiving standard care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p>

              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first RCT of a task-shifting intervention using nurses and lay educators to deliver asthma management in sSA. The key finding was a clinically and statistically significant improvement in asthma control in the intervention versus standard care group, with a difference in mean cACT change from baseline of 2.1 points (95% CI: 1.1 to 3.1) between groups. Greatest benefit was seen in those with poorer asthma control at baseline.</p>
              <p>We found a high burden of symptoms among asthmatic children attending an outpatient clinic at baseline; in the preceding 3 months, one-quarter of participants had been admitted to hospital, a further one-third had attended a health facility, without overnight admission, and two-thirds had missed school due to acute asthma symptoms. The overall mean (SD) cACT was 20.3 (2.6), with 85% of participants reporting suboptimal asthma control, by GINA criteria. Despite a high burden of symptoms and previous engagement with the healthcare system, one-fifth had no salbutamol inhaler and less than half had received ICS treatment, with relatively low daily doses.</p>
              <p>In addition to improved asthma control, significantly fewer children in the intervention group experienced asthma exacerbations requiring emergency health facility attendance and school absence.</p>
              <p>Participants demonstrated raised FeNO levels, confirming that ICS treatment is highly appropriate in this population. Self-reported ICS use was greater in the intervention group, with more children taking daily beclometasone, and participants prescribed a significantly higher daily dose. However, preintervention and postintervention FeNO levels were similar, suggesting unchanged levels of airway inflammation, possibly due to non-compliance with ICS treatment or lack of response in this population. Self-reported adherence rates were high (&gt;85%); however, there are often discrepancies when objective measures of adherence are compared with self-reports.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Improved outcomes maybe due to increased confidence to intervene early in an attack, with self-management of symptoms at home, through effective use of inhaled salbutamol.</p>
              <p>Current GINA guidance (for those ≥12 years) advises against salbutamol monotherapy, recommending using ICS either regularly or whenever salbutamol is taken.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Compliance with daily ICS is a challenge in countries across the world; further research is required in LMICs to explore the clinical and cost-effectiveness of combination inhalers, which are becoming widely used in HICs.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This is particularly important in children, where detrimental effects of airway inflammation during lung growth and development may have longer-term impact.</p>
              <p>Participants were generally able to collect inhalers, free of charge, from our tertiary-level hospital pharmacy; however, this does not reflect availability of inhalers more widely in Malawi: a recent survey reported that &lt;5% of health facilities, including district hospitals, have resources to treat chronic asthma.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The reliable and affordable supply of inhaled medication, across all levels of health facilities, is a major challenge which must be addressed in many LICs.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p>We found relatively high levels of reported asthma control (64.2%), defined by cACT ≥20, compared with other studies in sSA, although most published data relate to adult patients.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Among paediatric patients attending a tertiary clinic in South Africa, 55.7% had controlled asthma (ACT/cACT &gt;19) with mean (SD) cACT score 19.9 (5.5).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, despite the baseline cACT for our participants suggesting reasonable symptom control, the burden of exacerbations requiring health facility attendance and school absence was high.</p>
              <p>Without a locally validated assessment tool, the choice of outcome measurement for this study was challenging; neither ACT nor cACT have been validated within sSA. The cACT is designed for children aged 4–11 years with four questions for the child, using a pictorial scale of Western children’s faces to rate symptoms, and three questions for their accompanying adult (total score: 0–27).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 23</xref> The ACT is for those aged ≥12 years, with five questions (total score: 5–25).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We chose to use the cACT for all participants, given the younger ages of most children attending clinic, rather than two separate tools, to avoid confusion for the study team and to avoid combining different scoring systems. However, obtaining responses which truly reflect the child’s clinical condition is difficult; younger children may struggle to recognise and articulate symptoms and have a poor perception of time, and children may be reluctant to answer, deferring to their elders in a culture which promotes hierarchical respect. Changing caregivers meant that adults were sometimes unsure of the child’s symptoms over the preceding month, particularly at night or during the school day. To date, a clinically meaningful difference in cACT has not been established; in adults, the minimally important difference in ACT is three points.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</p>
              <p>We identified several children with severe airway obstruction but normal cACT scores; symptom perception may be impaired in children with chronic airflow obstruction and the poor correlation between self-reported symptoms and spirometry is well-recognised.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Additionally, we recognise a cultural tendency among Malawians to under-report symptoms. Spirometry has limited availability outside of the research setting in most LICs, but peak flow metres can provide a useful alternative and may be a more appropriate component of future interventions to provide an objective assessment of airway obstruction.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Given the lack of other studies using non-clinical staff for task-shifting, we deliberately set a short follow-up period for this study to minimise loss to follow-up and maximise the chances of identifying a benefit or harm from this novel approach. Overall completeness of data collection was good, including acceptable and repeatable spirometry data for over 80% of participants.</p>
              <p>We relied on self-report of symptoms, exacerbations and inhaler use: recall bias is a potential limitation. We tried to quantify medication use by weighing inhalers but abandoned this as very few participants brought their inhaler canisters despite reminders. Our study recruited patients attending outpatient follow-up at a tertiary hospital—we would expect a high rate of previous hospital admissions and attendances, since many patients are referred to this clinic from paediatric wards and the emergency department: this may explain why both groups to showed clinical improvement during the study and means our findings represent more severely affected asthmatic children in Malawi. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that optimisation of inhaled treatment, supported by asthma education delivered by non-physicians, can have a beneficial effect on asthma outcomes.</p>
              <p>Malawi suffers from a shortage of trained medical staff with 2 physicians and 28 nurses per 100 000 population, well below the WHO ‘critical shortage’ threshold of 2.5 health professionals (including doctors, nurses and midwives) per 1000 population.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This huge deficit in workforce requires an alternative approach to healthcare delivery: task-shifting has been successfully employed in the community case management of childhood illnesses and to improve access to HIV services in Malawi.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> Considering asthma management specifically, a study from Cameroon reported decreased asthma attacks among mostly adult patients attending a nurse-led asthma clinic, although loss to follow-up was high.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Task-shifting asthma education to non-medical cadres has been explored in high-income settings, with comparable outcomes reported for asthma education delivered by lay people and nurses to adult patients.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The use of lay educators has not previously been evaluated in LMICs: we propose that the potential impact may be greater than in HICs, due to lower baseline education and health literacy levels among poorer populations.</p>
              <p>These promising data require further exploration of task-shifting in low-income settings. Scale-up of similar interventions across a wider range of healthcare settings, including both children and adults, could present substantial benefits to asthmatic patients and their families; assessment of health economic and longer-term clinical outcomes is required.</p>
              <p>Together we can, and must, do better: building networks of clinicians and researchers from across sSA is essential to raise asthma awareness among local communities, healthcare providers and policy makers, to deliver LMIC-relevant research to inform clinical guidelines and address the deplorable global disparities in access to inhaled medication.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Effective asthma treatment should be available to all who need it, regardless of where they live.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
