                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children are common and present major resource implications for primary care. Unnecessary use of antibiotics is associated with the development and proliferation of antimicrobial resistance. In 2016, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded ‘TARGET’ programme developed a prognostic algorithm to identify children with acute cough and RTI at very low risk of 30-day hospitalisation and unlikely to need antibiotics. The intervention includes: (1) explicit elicitation of parental concerns, (2) the results of the prognostic algorithm accompanied by prescribing guidance and (3) provision of a printout for carers including safety netting advice. The CHIldren’s COugh feasibility study suggested differential recruitment of healthier patients in control practices. This phase III ‘efficiently designed’ trial uses routinely collected data at the practice level, thus avoiding individual patient consent. The aim is to assess whether embedding a multifaceted intervention into general practitioner (GP) practice Information Technology (IT) systems will result in reductions of antibiotic prescribing without impacting on hospital attendance for RTI.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The coprimary outcomes are (1) practice rate of dispensed amoxicillin and macrolide antibiotics, (2) hospital admission rate for RTI using routinely collected data by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Data will be collected for children aged 0–9 years registered at 310 practices (155 intervention, 155 usual care) over a 12-month period. Recruitment and randomisation of practices (using the Egton Medical Information Systems web data management system) is conducted via each CCG stratified for children registered and baseline dispensing rates of each practice. Secondary outcomes will explore intervention effect modifiers. Qualitative interviews will explore intervention usage. The economic evaluation will be limited to a between-arm comparison in a cost–consequence analysis.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children are a common reason for antibiotic prescribing. In English primary care, most antibiotics are prescribed for conditions that only sometimes require antibiotic treatment, depending on patient-specific indicators.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although there has been a decline in prescribing for uncomplicated RTI in England over the last decade, more than a third of children were still prescribed antibiotics for these infections.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Clinical uncertainty in primary care regarding the prognosis of children with RTIs (ie, knowing which children will and won’t subsequently deteriorate) contributes to the unnecessary use of existing antibiotics, which is associated with increasing antimicrobial resistance.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Qualitative work from our 5-year National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded ‘TARGET’ programme grant, completed in 2016, identified this uncertainty as a major driver of antibiotic prescribing.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> We hypothesised that improved identification of children at very low risk of future hospitalisation might help reduce clinical uncertainty.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> As part of the ‘TARGET’ programme, we developed a prognostic algorithm that could be used by clinicians to identify children at very low risk of hospitalisation as well as tools to improve patient-–doctor communication.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>

                <title>Lessons learnt from the feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial</title>
                <p>Findings from across the ‘TARGET’ programme were used to develop a complex intervention designed to reduce antibiotic prescribing. The subsequent feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) for CHIldren’s COugh (CHICO) showed significant prescribing reductions in both arms of the trial compared with the cohort data of the programme but also exposed both lower prescribing levels and differential recruitment of healthier children in the control arm.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the qualitative interviews, clinicians reported preferential recruitment of less unwell children as these were quicker to manage and therefore easier to recruit. To negate differential recruitment, and conserve resources, an ‘efficient design’ was proposed for the full trial. Efficient design trials often use routinely collected data.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the case of CHICO using aggregated data, this both avoids the need for individual patient consent (and differential recruitment) and utilises existing practice level data. This simpler design, placing fewer demands on clinicians and practices compared with other studies, will also encourage the recruitment of research-naïve practices. The primary outcomes are routinely collected antibiotic dispensing data, collected by ePACT2 for the National Health Service (NHS) prescribing services,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and hospital admission data collected by all English Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs decide what services are needed for diverse local populations, and ensure that they are provided (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ccgs/">https://www.england.nhs.uk/ccgs/</ext-link>). They also hold responsibility for local antimicrobial prescribing guidelines. Lessons learnt from the feasibility study also suggested better use of the tool would be facilitated if the intervention was embedded within the practice electronic health record system. The intervention in this study has thus been embedded in the Egton Medical Information Systems (EMIS) electronic patient record system, used in 56% of the primary care practices in England.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>

                <p>The aim of the CHICO RCT is to reduce antibiotic prescribing among children presenting with acute cough and RTI without increasing hospital admission for this condition.</p>
                <p>The objectives are to determine whether the CHICO intervention decrease the number of dispensed prescriptions for oral amoxicillin and macrolide antibiotics (the predominant antibiotics given to children presenting with acute cough and RTIs in the UK) for children aged 0–9 years (efficacy comparison) and to determine if the CHICO intervention does not increase hospital admissions for children with a hospital diagnosis of RTI (non-inferiority comparison).</p>

                <p>The CHICO RCT is an efficient, pragmatic open-label, two-arm (intervention vs usual care) trial with an embedded qualitative study, aimed at reducing antibiotic prescribing among children presenting with acute cough and RTI, with randomisation at the practice level, using routine antibiotic dispensing and hospitalisation data to assess effectiveness.</p>

                <title>Study population, setting and recruitment plan</title>
                <p>The study population is children aged 0–9 years presenting with acute cough and RTI. Oral suspensions are more often given to this age group. The setting is consultations in primary care practices with prescribing clinicians in diverse regions across England. Recruitment is at the practice level, so consent is not required for individual participants. Recruitment of practices is via CCGs and by using the Clinical Research Network (CRN) who support patients, the public and health and care organisations across England to participate in high-quality research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/support/clinical-research-network">https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/support/clinical-research-network</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href=".htm">.htm</ext-link>). All CCGs are already committed to national AMR strategies and an initial approach to several CCGs about collaboration in this study has been enthusiastically welcomed. CCGs with 15 or more EMIS practices will be targeted and we will use a member of the CCG medicines management team as the primary contact given the established links they already have helping to provide routine data.</p>

                  <p>The theory-informed intervention<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> consists of both a clinician-focused algorithm to predict risk of hospitalisation for RTI in the following 30 days, in children with acute cough and RTI, and carer-focused personalised information recording decisions made at the consultation and safety netting information.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
                  <p>The algorithm contains seven predictors (mnemonic STARWAVe): <underline>S</underline>hort illness duration (parent/carer reported ≤3 days); raised <underline>T</underline>emperature (parent/carer reported severe in previous 24 hours or ≥37.8°C on examination); age of child (&lt;2 years); intercostal or subcostal <underline>R</underline>ecession on examination; <underline>W</underline>heeze during chest stethoscope examination; history of <underline>A</underline>sthma and <underline>V</underline>omiting (parent/carer reported moderate or severe in the 24 hours prior to consultation). The actions related to the algorithm scores are shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, in each case the algorithm result (eg, low-risk group) automatically appears and the pop-up text is available if the clinician hovers over the result. The algorithm is intended as a supportive additional component of a consultation in which it is likely that a number of aspects will inform the clinical decision making, including whether or not to prescribe antibiotics.</p>

Data will be entered onto a purpose designed database, validation and cleaning will be carried out throughout the trial. Only the administrative team and analysts will be able to access this data.</p>
                <p>The number of dispensed amoxicillin and macrolides antibiotics given to children aged 0–9 years will be taken from the routine data source, epact2,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which provides practice-specific information by each 5-year age epoch. Data will be collected from CCGs for every participating practice with regards to the number of hospitalisations and emergency department attendances for RTIs. Only fully anonymised data sets will be sent from the GP practices and CCGs. This will be sent to a secure NHS e-mail address. We will collect data for the 12-month period each practice will be in the study and the 12-month period prior to randomisation. An ‘implementation period’ of around 1 month will allow time for the practices to instal the intervention and encourage staff to use it. Any data collected during this period will not be used in the analysis. Where data are suppressed, owing to a low number of events, practices will be asked to provide aggregate 12-month data for baseline and follow-up. Practice list size data, per month and 5-year epoch, will be obtained from the NHS digital website. In the unlikely event that a practice no longer wishes to participate, we will request all outstanding data collected up until the point of withdrawal. For intervention practices only, monthly intervention usage data will be captured. The data will be extracted from the EMIS system and will include how often the intervention is being used and by whom. Fidelity will be measured from the analysis of intervention data usage, scrutiny of the follow-up questionnaires and qualitative interviews.</p>
                <p>The trial is supported by the Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC). The trial will conform to the BRTC standard operating procedures. The BRTC central research team will help prepare the trial documentation and data collection forms, specify the randomisation scheme, develop and maintain the study database, check data quality, monitor recruitment and carry out analyses in collaboration with the investigators. Both an independent trials steering committee (TSC) and data monitoring committee (DMC) will be appointed.</p>

This trial is a low risk study, SAEs will only be reported if they are fatal or serious and potentially related to trial participation (ie, they result from advice provided by the intervention algorithm). As one of the outcomes for the trial is hospitalisation, we do expect some participants to be admitted to hospital (due to a deterioration of their underlying illness). Hospitalisation due to RTI is an expected SAE and will not be subject to expedited reporting. Both SAEs and hospitalisation rates will be regularly reported to the DMC who will raise any safety concerns to the trial team and TSC for further action. Expected SAEs include but are not limited to pneumonia, empyema, deteriorating bronchiolitis.</p>

                <p>Both sample size calculations assume 90% power and a conservative two-sided alpha of 0.025 to take account of the two coprimary outcomes. Both sample sizes also assume an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.03 (which has been described as the upper CI for ICCs in efficient cluster randomised trials,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> an estimated coefficient of variation of 0.65 (to take account of differences in cluster size<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and an assumption of 750 children on average aged 0–9 years registered per practice (based on Bristol &amp; Bath CCG data). Expected differences assumed: (1) a reduction in dispensing rate from 33 prescriptions per 100 registered children aged 0–9 years to 29 (or fewer) prescriptions (ie, ≥10% overall reduction); and (2) a hospitalisation rate that is no more than 2% in the intervention arm, compared with the control arm which is estimated to be 1%. This is based on a non-inferiority margin of 1%, however, the investigators wanted to err on the side of caution and use a two-sided alpha for the sample size calculation. This gave an overall sample size requirement of 310 practices; 155 intervention and 155 control practices.</p>

                <p>To address our secondary aims (S2) a focus on costs will clarify whether and by how much NHS costs might change in the event of a widespread deployment of the algorithm into routine clinical practice. Given the light-touch efficient design of the trial, the economic evaluation will be limited to a between-arm comparison of mean NHS costs in a cost–consequence analysis. NHS costs will be calculated from the costs of the intervention itself, prescriptions of amoxicillin and macrolides per the coprimary outcome, ED attendances and hospital admissions.</p>

                <p>Qualitative interviews with clinicians (GPs and practice nurses) and other practice staff (managers, pharmacists) and CCG staff (medicines managers) will explore the use of the intervention, how it was embedded into practice and whether it was used appropriately.

                <p>NPT proposes that implementation of interventions is dependent on the ability of participants to fulfil four criteria; ‘coherence’ (how people make sense of the intervention), ‘cognitive participation’ (the work to develop new practices), ‘collective action’ (the work to operationalise practices) and ‘reflexive monitoring’ (ways in which people appraise how new practices are working).</p>
                <p>Clinicians and other key staff from the intervention practices will be invited to participate in semistructured interviews to explore their views and experiences of the intervention. Audio recorded verbal consent will be taken from participants. The first set of interviews will be conducted during the internal pilot phase and findings fed back to help guide best practice during the rest of the study. A second phase of interviews will be conducted when the clinicians have been using the intervention for several months to investigate the normalisation and sustainability of using the intervention. Interviews are expected to take 30–45 min.</p>

A full CHICO statistical analysis plan will be developed and agreed by the TSC prior to undertaking analyses of the main trial. The statistical analysis plan will include health economics and qualitative analysis subsections. At the end of the trial, all outcomes will be described and compared with the appropriate descriptive statistics where relevant: mean and SD for continuous and count outcomes, medians and IQR if required for skewed data and numbers and percentages for dichotomous and categorical outcomes. Depending on the dispersion of the data we may use linear regression or a random effects Poisson regression (negative binomial regression) model to analyse both coprimaries, with CCG included as a random effect. This has the advantage of incorporating person-years follow-up (number of children at a practice multiplied by the length of follow-up for that practice) and examining clustering by CCG. Each coprimary will be adjusted for baseline dispensing rates or hospitalisation rates, using the 12 months of data collected prior to randomisation. Effects of number of practices within CCGs and number of patients within each practice will also be investigated in a sensitivity analysis. Other baseline characteristics between practices will be examined to ensure randomisation is balanced in the two arms. Any differences in excess of 0.5 SDs or 10% or more will be controlled for in sensitivity analyses to ensure that the imbalance does not affect the overall result. The effects of missing data will be explored using sensitivity analyses. We anticipate no more than 10% missing data and that it will be missing at random. The pattern and extent of missing data will be explored and any changes to the methods described in the analysis plan will be fully justified in the study report and publication. All quantitative data will be analysed using Stata version 15.</p>
