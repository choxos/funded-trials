                <p>Low-intensity cognitive behaviour therapy including behavioural activation is an
evidence-based treatment for depression, a condition frequently co-occurring
with autism. The feasibility of adapting low-intensity cognitive behaviour
therapy for depression to meet the needs of autistic adults via a randomised
controlled trial was investigated. The adapted intervention (guided self-help)
comprised materials for nine individual sessions with a low-intensity
psychological therapist. Autistic adults (n = 70) with depression (Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 score ⩾10) recruited from National Health Service adult
autism services and research cohorts were randomly allocated to guided self-help
or treatment as usual. Outcomes at 10-, 16- and 24-weeks post-randomisation were
blind to treatment group. Rates of retention in the study differed by treatment
group with more participants attending follow-up in the guided self-help group
than treatment as usual. The adapted intervention was well-received, 86%
(n = 30/35) of participants attended the pre-defined ‘dose’ of five sessions of
treatment and 71% (25/35) attended all treatment sessions. The findings of this
pilot randomised controlled trial indicate that low-intensity cognitive
behaviour therapy informed by behavioural activation can be successfully adapted
to meet the needs of autistic people. Evaluation of the effectiveness of this
intervention in a full scale randomised controlled trial is now warranted.</p>

              <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), thought to affect 1% of the UK adult population
(<xref rid="bibr5-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Brugha et al., 2011</xref>),
is characterised by qualitative impairments in social communication and a
stereotyped, repetitive or restricted pattern of activities, behaviours and
interests (<xref rid="bibr1-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric
Association, 2013</xref>). High rates of co-occurring mental health conditions
are reported across the life-span in ASD (e.g. <xref rid="bibr19-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Simonoff et al., 2008</xref>) including
depression. Depression, characterised by persistent sadness and low mood with a
range of accompanying physical, emotional and behavioural symptoms, is a
debilitating mental health condition (<xref rid="bibr41-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Whiteford et al., 2013</xref>). There is evidence
that autistic<sup><xref rid="fn1-1362361319889272" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup> people are disproportionately affected by depression (<xref rid="bibr30-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Rai et al., 2018</xref>) with an estimated current
and life-time adult prevalence of 23% and 37%, respectively (<xref rid="bibr17-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Hollocks et al., 2018</xref>). Effective
treatments for depression exist. ‘Low-intensity’ cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT),
to include behavioural activation (BA), is recommended as an evidence-based
psychological treatment for mild–moderate depression (CG90, <xref rid="bibr28-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE), 2009</xref>) in adults. Low intensity typically refers to low usage of
specialist therapist time (<xref rid="bibr4-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Bower
&amp; Gilbody, 2005</xref>) via the provision of evidence-based information
which can be accessed independently (self-help) or with the support of a mental
health worker (guided self-help (GSH)), or by the cost-effective use of specialist
therapist time such as group interventions.</p>
              <p>Accessing mainstream psychological therapies can be difficult for autistic people due
to communication and neurocognitive differences. In addition, many therapists have
not been trained in working with autistic people (<xref rid="bibr9-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>). Clinical guidance for
psychosocial interventions for co-occurring mental health problems in autism state
that the recommended intervention for the specific disorder in the general
population should be offered with adaptations made to meet the needs of autistic
people (NICE CG 142, 170). Where the recommended intervention is CBT, strategies to
adapt CBT to meet the needs of autistic people have been identified in the NICE
clinical guidance for autism in adults (NICE CG 142). Adapted CBT has been found to
be an effective treatment for anxiety co-occurring with autism (see reviews by <xref rid="bibr40-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Weston, Hodgekins, &amp; Langdon,
2016</xref>). A review by <xref rid="bibr40-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">White et al. (2018)</xref> highlight that there have been few studies
investigating depression. Studies of combined anxiety and depression treatment
(<xref rid="bibr26-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">McGillivray &amp; Evert,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Sizoo &amp;
Kuiper, 2017</xref>) have reported no convincing evidence of an effect of
treatment group on depression measures, although sample sizes have been small. There
has been a study of an adapted group CBT protocol for depression (<xref rid="bibr33-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Santomauro et al., 2016</xref>)
reporting a reduction in depression scores of 20 autistic adolescents. The authors
urge caution in the light of a small sample size and lack of control group at
follow-up. A study of adults (n = 42) randomised to mindfulness-based stress
reduction (MBSR) or treatment as usual (TAU) reported a significant effect of MBSR
on depression measures (<xref rid="bibr36-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Spek et
al., 2013</xref>). These studies suggest some preliminary evidence in support of
cognitive-behavioural interventions for depression adapted for autism. However,
there have been no adult studies with an exclusive focus on depression investigating
autism adaptations to low-intensity CBT for depression.</p>
              <p>Low-intensity CBT may offer benefits for the treatment of depression co-occurring
with autism for a number of reasons. First, BA is the recommended treatment model
for low-intensity CBT for depression. BA, informed by learning theory, is an
approach developed by <xref rid="bibr25-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Martell et
al. (2001)</xref> which aims to change an individual’s behavioural repertoire to
increase opportunities to access positive reinforcement and thereby reduce
depression. These aims are primarily achieved through activity scheduling, whereby
the individual plans and schedules specified activities in their weekly routine
based on a detailed analysis of their current behaviour. People are encouraged to
become more aware of the triggers for low mood and consequences of a range of
behaviours and to then use this information to make changes in line with individual
goals. BA may be highly suited as an intervention for depression in autistic adults.
First, a restricted, repetitive, stereotyped pattern of behaviour, interests and
activities is a core characteristic of autism. It is possible that when depressed,
autistic people do not easily generate shifts in routines, behaviours and thought
patterns towards activities and actions that may offer increased access to pleasure
and a sense of achievement, and thus reduce depression. This tendency towards
restricted activities and interests, including repetitive thinking, may form part of
the behavioural maintenance cycle of depression symptoms in autism with some
research evidence in support of this (e.g. <xref rid="bibr13-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Gotham et al., 2014</xref>). Second, the
well-documented executive function differences in autism (<xref rid="bibr11-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Demetriou et al., 2018</xref>) mean that
generating and implementing novel planned behaviour and activity can be compromised
in autistic people. To this end, BA adapted for the needs of autistic people may be
helpful in broadening behavioural and thought repertoires to ultimately improve
depressed mood.</p>
              <p>In addition, adaptations to CBT to meet the needs of autistic people recommend the
use of written information with visual aids (<xref rid="bibr29-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">NICE, 2012</xref>). The provision of written
information is at the core of a low-intensity intervention. Adapting the written
information to meet the needs of autistic people means that low-intensity
psychological therapists who do not have extensive experience in working with
autistic adults have less elements of their therapeutic practice to adapt, that is,
some of the key adaptations are delivered through the materials. This may confer
some advantages to a low-intensity intervention over individual talking therapy
which is solely verbally mediated. In a survey of CBT therapists, confidence in
adapting practice for autistic people was significantly associated with level of
therapist training (<xref rid="bibr9-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et
al., 2018</xref>). Low-intensity interventions were developed with the aim of
disseminating evidence-based practice to mental health professionals from a range of
backgrounds. This may be highly pertinent to autistic adults who can receive support
and healthcare from a range of professionals.</p>

                  <p>Potential participants were introduced to the study by clinicians in two NHS

research opportunity (Bristol) and a UK autism cohort study, across two
geographical regions of England (Bristol, Bath and North East Somerset; and
Northumberland, Tyne and Wear). The recruitment procedure is described in
full in the published protocol (<xref rid="bibr31-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2017</xref>). In brief,
those interested in the study who gave permission to be contacted by the
research team were provided with full study information and if they
expressed an interest had a telephone screening according to the inclusion
and exclusion criteria. The PHQ-9 (<xref rid="bibr22-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Kroenke &amp; Spitzer, 2002</xref>) could
be completed as part of the telephone screening or by return post if
preferred. The PHQ-9 is a reliable and valid nine-item self-report measure
of depression commonly used in primary care settings. A PHQ-9 score ⩾10
conferred eligibility for the study which was further confirmed at a
face-to-face meeting. The Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) (<xref rid="bibr24-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 1992</xref>)
was administered at this meeting to capture current depression. The CIS-R is

International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) psychiatric diagnoses.
Fully informed consent in writing was obtained from eligible participants

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>GSH comprised materials for nine weekly sessions which participants could work
through with the support of a ‘coach’, that is, a low-intensity psychological
therapist. The intervention (see <xref rid="bibr31-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2017</xref>), based on BA, was
tailored to meet the needs of autistic people. The feedback of two autistic
adults informed two iterations of the session materials. The materials had a
consistent structure and format. Visual images were used to supplement written
accounts of psychological principles. Emotional literacy and executive function
difference were supported throughout. The aim of the intervention was to
facilitate learning about links between situations, behaviours and feelings, and
use this learning to schedule activities promoting positive feelings. The
initial session was an orientation to GSH, the role of the ‘coach’ and an
opportunity for the coach to learn about individualised needs for autism
specific adaptations. Individual goal-setting for the intervention was completed
at the end of this session. Sessions 2 and 3 focused on mapping daily situations
and behaviours using a visual map and diary sheet. Session 4 took an educational
approach to noticing and rating positive feelings. Session 5 brought together
information about situations, behaviours and feelings. This information was used
to schedule activities to increase opportunities for positive mood which were
also in line with an individual’s goals and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. An
individual’s needs for support and prompts to implement the activity schedule
plans were also discussed. Recording information about situations, behaviours
and feelings using the map and/or diary sheets was a consistent between-session
task. Sessions 6–8 were spent refining activity scheduling to extend to novel
situations and novel behaviours if appropriate. Session 9 was a review of
treatment principles and goals. To simulate routine clinical practice, the PHQ-9
and General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) were administered at the
start of each session. The intervention was delivered face-to-face, weekly in
outpatient clinic settings and was intended to be delivered across 10 weeks.
However, participant and/or coach availability as a result of factors such as
illness, holidays and educational/work commitments meant that 16 weeks presented
a more realistic time-frame for delivery of the intervention. Each session
lasted between 30 and 45 min, with the exception of the initial planning session
which could last up to 90 min. The final two sessions could be delivered by
telephone according to patient preference. Engagement with five sessions
constituted a treatment ‘dose’ as the main therapeutic principles had been
presented at that stage.</p>
                <p>GSH coaches were graduate level psychologists with foundation knowledge of CBT
who attended 15 h of training in the intervention and working with autistic
people. Coaches received weekly supervision (1 h in duration) from the research
clinical psychologists who had designed the intervention (A.R., S.B. and K.C.).

one of the objectives of this feasibility study was to identify the most
appropriate outcome measure, and hence three depression measures were included

                <p>Eleven percent (n = 4/35) of participants randomised to GSH withdrew from
treatment. Of these, two participants did not attend any treatment sessions and
withdrew from the study, one participant attended two GSH sessions and withdrew
from the study and one participant attended five GSH sessions but did not
withdraw from the study, completing all outcome measures. Sixty-three percent
(n = 20/32) of participants who started GSH did so within 2 weeks of
randomisation. Ninety-one percent (n = 32/35) of participants attended at least
one session of GSH, and 71% (n = 25/35) attended all nine sessions. One
participant was unable to attend any sessions due to ill-health but did not
withdraw from the treatment or the study. The mean number of treatment sessions
was 7.6 (SD: 2.9, n = 35) with 86% (n = 30/35) completing the pre-specified
‘dose’ of treatment, that is, five sessions. By 10 weeks, 31% (10/32) had
completed the intervention, by 16 weeks, 73% (23/32) had completed the
intervention and by 24 weeks, 84% (27/32) had completed treatment. Information
about reasons for spacing of appointments and rate of attendance was not
systematically collected. However, participant and coach availability due to
holidays or ill-health, adverse events such as homelessness, organisational
difficulties and the impact of depression on behavioural motivation were factors
which affected attendance and pacing of appointments such that 16 weeks
presented a more practicable treatment window.</p>
                <p>The intervention was delivered face-to-face for most participants. A minority
accessed the intervention via Skype (n = 3/32, 9%) due to difficulties attending
face-to-face treatment for health and childcare reasons.</p>

10-weeks post-randomisation, it would be more appropriate to measure the primary
outcome at a later time point for a large-scale trial. Therefore, the

                <p>The sensitivity to change of the self-report measures of depression (PHQ-9 and
BDI-II) with the observer-rated HAM-D was assessed. At the beginning of the
study, 14 HAM-D assessments administered by two raters were double-rated
independently with inter-rater agreement on total HAM-D scores very high
(&gt;90%), with some variability in inter-rater agreement at the individual item
level (e.g. 37.5% on depressed mood and 87.5% for insomnia). Additional raters
were trained in HAM-D administration across the duration of the study, and
inter-rater agreement on the 28% of the HAM-D administrations assessed at the
end of the study indicated poor reliability. Only one pair of assessors had a
Cohen’s kappa of more than 0.8 (range 0.1–0.8), which had been pre-specified as
acceptable. Given these data, the planned sensitivity to change analyses of the
two self-reported depression measures was considered inappropriate.</p>

used antidepressant medication (43%–66%), attended an NHS outpatient or
community mental health team clinic for mental health problems (11%–49%) and/or
visited their GP (26%–46%). Twenty-nine percent of participants also used other
medication for mental health conditions. Participants did not report any
overnight stays in an NHS hospital, or visits to a private hospital or clinic
due to mental health problems, and rarely attended an A&amp;E department, an
out-of-hours clinic or NHS walk-in centre. Twenty-three percent of participants
had counselling or talking therapy during the trial outside of the trial
intervention. Participants used a variety of different types of help for mental
health problems including support groups and received help around or outside of
the home. Twenty-seven percent of participants took time off work due to mental
health problems. Many participants attended a social group (24%) or drop-in
service (26%) for autistic adults. Participants rarely had a home visit from any
other professional (for any medical condition). Thirty percent of participants
paid NHS prescription charges, and 43% received disability payments.
Participants did not come into contact with the criminal justice system (either
as a victim or as a potential suspect).</p>
                <p>It was possible to compare data from self-reported questionnaires and electronic
medical records (EMRs) only for those participants from the Bristol region due
to issues with collecting EMR data from the North-East site. There was a lack of
concordance between the self-reported and the EMR data for those variables where
both sources of information were available (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1362361319889272" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Material 3</ext-link>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>It was feasible to develop and implement a low-intensity intervention for depression
for autistic adults and recruit the planned number of participants into a RCT. Rates
of retention differed across the study according to treatment group. Noticeably,
fewer people remained in the TAU group of the study with the majority withdrawing
directly after randomisation. It was difficult to engage these participants in the
qualitative interview study to ascertain the reasons why. One participant did agree
to be interviewed and stated the outcome of randomisation was the reason for
withdrawal. More than 70% of the participants had prior experience of talking
therapy which may account for the potential lack of clinical equipoise. Participants
in the qualitative study talked about wanting to try something ‘new’ (<xref rid="bibr32-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., in press</xref>).
The findings of the qualitative study indicated that participants understood the
information provided about the trial and the randomisation procedure.</p>
              <p>Depression in this sample of autistic adults was relatively severe and persistent.
The majority of participants had depression for 2 years or more. The relative
severity of the depression in this sample raises questions about the appropriateness
of a low-intensity intervention. A number of individuals were assessed as not
eligible to take part in the study because of the severity of illness and were
referred for higher intensity treatment. Taken together, these findings highlight
the range of clinical need in this group.</p>
              <p>There was good engagement with the adapted low-intensity intervention and the
majority of participants attended all sessions. Rates of withdrawal from the
treatment group are similar to those reported by other trials of psychological
interventions with autistic adults (e.g. <xref rid="bibr23-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Langdon et al., 2016</xref>). Sixteen weeks
presented a realistic window for treatment delivery. The therapist GSH intervention,
with nine individual sessions of up to 45 min could be construed as at the upper
limit of ‘low intensity’. In addition to session duration, coaches made practical
adjustments to accommodate the needs of individual participants such as appointment
reminders and flexibility around timings and frequency of sessions. The findings of
the qualitative interview study (<xref rid="bibr18-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Horwood, Cooper, Harvey, Evans, &amp; Russell, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., in press</xref>)
indicated that the intervention was well-received by participants.</p>
              <p>The set of measures used in the study captured a broad range of outcomes with the aim
of characterising the sample and the feasibility of investigating the potential for
co-occurring conditions to influence treatment outcome in a larger study. In the GSH
group, the majority of participants completed the full set of measures, but the high
rate of attrition in the TAU group impacts on our ability to learn from these. To
our knowledge, this is the first adult study of a psychological intervention using a
randomised trial design with TAU as a comparator. Measures to improve participant
engagement with future trials of similar design may benefit from co-production of
study information and newsletters as well as including incentives for follow-up.</p>
              <p>In respect of findings related to measurement in this study, two main issues were
identified. First, it was not possible to conduct the planned analyses to identify
which of the two self-report measures of depression was most sensitive to change.
Poor inter-rater reliability of the ‘benchmark’ interview measure was at the root of
this. The expert raters commented that valid administration of the HAM-D in autistic
adults was difficult if interviewers were relatively new to the client group. Open
questions did not always work well, in particular questions about emotional states.
Less-experienced interviewers lacked the confidence to be more directive at
interview, for example, follow-up with direct/closed or forced-choice prompts to
elicit the information needed to rate items. The two self-report measures of
depression were well-aligned. There was some anecdotal evidence from researchers
that participants preferred the format of the BDI-II with item sets of descriptive
statements from which to choose. Researchers described how some participants
struggled to complete the PHQ-9 with the need to rate their experiences using
temporal categories requiring a degree of judgement, for example, distinguishing
between ‘not at all’ and ‘several’ days. Two studies have reported the BDI-II to be
an adequate screening tool for depression in autism (<xref rid="bibr8-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Cederlund et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Gotham et al., 2015</xref>). A
systematic review of the use of depression measures in autistic adults (<xref rid="bibr7-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Cassidy et al., 2018</xref>) found
that one study investigating psychometric properties of depression measures met
eligibility criteria for the review. This study (<xref rid="bibr14-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Gotham et al., 2015</xref>) reported the BDI-II to
have good internal consistency, adequate sensitivity and specificity and good
convergent validity when administered to autistic people. The psychometric
properties of the PHQ-9 for use in autistic adults have not been investigated. There
were no studies reporting the sensitivity to change of any measures. A number of
clinical trials with autistic children and adults have reported treatment effect
sizes to vary according to rater. The results of a meta-analysis report how
informant and clinician ratings show medium–large effect sizes when compared with
small effects of treatment as reported by patients themselves (<xref rid="bibr39-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Weston &amp; Hodgekins, 2016</xref>). Issues such
as alexithymia (e.g. <xref rid="bibr3-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">Berthoz
&amp; Hill, 2005</xref>) and the co-existence of multiple problems may mean
discriminating change at the individual symptom level is difficult. Nonetheless,
symptom change is reported across a number of measures including the depression
measures in the present study, suggesting that the use of self-report in adults who
are able to do so may be viable as part of a larger treatment study. On the basis of
the research evidence and the findings of this study, we conclude that the BDI-II
presents as the most suitable outcome measure for a future randomised controlled
trial.</p>
              <p>Second, there was a discrepancy between self-report and EMR reports about a number of
variables including antidepressant prescriptions and primary and secondary
healthcare attendance. Discrepancies were not in a single direction. It is likely
that practice records are the most accurate records of primary care attendance and
antidepressant medication. However, the interface between primary and secondary care
in respect of the latter may make it more difficult to accurately capture
prescriptions.</p>
              <p>This study was not powered to detect differences between the treatment groups.
However, review of scores on the main measures indicates that the intervention
merits further investigation. In conclusion, it was feasible to develop a
low-intensity cognitive-behavioural intervention adapted for the needs of autistic
people which was time-limited, structured, protocol-driven and used the principles
and elements of BA including functional analysis, attending to behaviours that
increase positive affect, activity scheduling and consolidation of learning to
sustain treatment gains. Differences to standard treatment comprised greater
therapist flexibility about location, timing and spacing of appointments, a longer
introductory session to build working alliance, increased awareness of and literacy
about positive mood via visual material, use of spatial cognition to link
behavioural antecedents and consequences and linking behaviours and positive affect
to personal needs to encourage self-regulation and self-care. These adaptations to
standard treatment are in line with those recommended by UK clinical guidance (NICE
CG142) for adapting psychosocial treatments for autism and also align well with the
outline of candidate mechanisms of action for therapeutic intervention proposed in
the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix (e.g. <xref rid="bibr40-1362361319889272" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2018</xref>). The intervention was
well-received, and it was feasible to run a clinical trial with a randomised design.
We now need evidence from a fully powered, large-scale trial to inform guidance as
to whether this low-intensity psychological intervention is an effective treatment
for autistic adults with co-occurring depression.</p>
