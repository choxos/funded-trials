                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) can be devastating and is a common cause of death and disability worldwide. Pre-ICH antiplatelet drug use is associated with a 27% relative increase in 1â€‰month case fatality compared with patients not using antithrombotic drugs. We aim to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled testing the safety and efficacy of desmopressin for patients with antiplatelet-associated ICH.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We aim to include 50 patients within 24â€‰hours of spontaneous ICH onset, associated with oral antiplatelet drug(s) use in at least the preceding 7â€‰days. Patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive intravenous desmopressin 20â€‰Âµg in 50 mL sodium chloride 0.9% infused over 20â€‰min or matching placebo. We will mask participants, relatives and outcome assessors to treatment allocation. Feasibility outcomes include proportion of patients approached being randomised, number of patients receiving allocated treatment, rate of recruitment and adherence to treatment and follow-up. Secondary outcomes include change in ICH volume at 24â€‰hours; hyponatraemia at 24â€‰hours, length of hospital stay, discharge destination, early death less than 28 days, death or dependency at day 90, death up to day 90, serious adverse events (including thromboembolic events) up to day 90; disability (Barthel index, day 90), quality of life (EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), day 90), cognition (telephone mini-mental state examination day 90) and health economic assessment (EQ-5D).</p>

                  <p>The Desmopressin for reversal of Antiplatelet drugs in Stroke due to Haemorrhage (DASH) trial received ethical approval from the East Midlandsâ€”Nottingham 2 research ethics committee (18/EM/0184). The DASH trial is funded by National Institute for Health
and Care Research RfPB grant: PB-PG-0816-20011. Trial results will be published in a peer reviewed academic journal and disseminated through academic conferences and through patient stroke support groups. Reporting will be in compliance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials recommendations.</p>

                <title>Desmopressin</title>
                <p>Desmopressin is a licensed pro-haemostatic drug that can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, intranasally or orally and is used in a number of inherited bleeding conditions to treat or prevent bleeding.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10â€“12</xref> Platelet function remains inhibited for 5â€“7 days after stopping antiplatelet drugs. Desmopressin stimulates release of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and factor VIII from endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies. VWF is responsible for platelet adhesion to collagen and may also bind platelets through their glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> so increased levels of VWF have the potential to compensate for the platelet function defect associated with antiplatelet drugs. Desmopressin may also increase the formation of procoagulant platelets.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
                <p>Desmopressin is recommended for the reversal of antiplatelet drugs in guidelines from the USA<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> but not in UK guidelines.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In a recent meta-analysis evaluating desmopressin for reversal of antiplatelet drugs for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, desmopressin was found to reduce blood loss, transfusion requirements and the need for a further operation due to bleeding.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
                <p>There are potential risks with use of desmopressin, including tachycardia hypotension, hyponatraemia and hyponatraemic seizures. A meta-analysis of 65 surgical randomised controlled trials, comparing desmopressin to placebo found no significant difference in rates of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or venous thromboembolism.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
                <p>Desmopressin has been tested in ICH in four case series where it appears to be safe.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19â€“22</xref> However, the series were small, non-randomised and did not have a placebo control arm, so it is not possible to make a clear assessment of the benefits and harms of administering desmopressin for these patients. American neurocritical care guidelines for the treatment of intracranial haemorrhage recommend consideration of 0.4 Î¼g/kg desmopressin for treatment of antiplatelet-associated ICH,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> although the level of evidence supporting this recommendation was recognised as very uncertain.</p>
                <p>Searches of clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Trials Clinical Registry Platform found no other ongoing randomised controlled trials of desmopressin vs placebo for reversal of antiplatelet drugs in stroke due to haemorrhage.</p>

                <p>Participants will be randomised centrally using a secure internet site in real-time. Treatment allocation will be concealed from all staff and patients involved in the trial. Randomisation involves minimisation on key prognostic risk factors: age (70 years or more); sex (male); time since onset (3â€‰hours or more); systolic blood pressure (170â€‰mm Hg or more); and presence (or no information on presence or absence) of intraventricular haemorrhage. This approach ensures concealment of allocation, minimises differences in key baseline prognostic variables and slightly improves statistical power.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Randomisation will allocate a number corresponding to a treatment pack and the participant will receive treatment from the allocated numbered pack. It was considered not possible to mask/blind personnel preparing the injection for administration to the treatment allocation because the ampoules of active and placebo injections are different and carry the manufacturerâ€™s identifying information. Clinicians, patients and outcome assessors (clinical, radiological and haematological assessors) will be blinded to treatment allocation.</p>
                <p>In general, there should be no need to unblind the allocated treatment. If some contraindication to desmopressin develops after randomisation, the trial treatment should be stopped. Unblinding should be done only in those rare cases when the doctor believes that clinical management depends importantly on knowledge of whether the patient received desmopressin or placebo. In those few cases when urgent unblinding is considered necessary, the doctor will call an emergency telephone number. The caller will then be told whether the patient received desmopressin or placebo. The rate of unblinding will be monitored and audited.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Patients will be randomised to either 20â€‰Âµg intravenous desmopressin (DDAVP, 4â€‰Âµg/mL 1â€‰mL glass ampoules, Ferring Pharmaceuticals) or placebo of intravenous sodium chloride 0.9%. Placebo was selected for comparison because at present there are no established haemostatic therapies for ICH. Either desmopressin 20â€‰Âµg (5Ã—4â€‰Âµg/mL) will be added to 50â€‰mL sodium chloride 0.9% and infused over 20â€‰min, or three 2â€‰mL sodium chloride 0.9% will be added to 50â€‰mL sodium chloride 0.9% and infused over 20â€‰min. The investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be stored between 2Â°C and 8Â°C until use. All patients will receive all usual standard care including venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression devices, blood pressure lowering therapy and neurosurgery if appropriate.</p>
                <p>We will administer a single dose as the risk of continued bleeding and haematoma expansion after ICH is greatest in the first few hours. High levels of factor VIII and VWF are maintained for 6â€“8â€‰hours after intravenous infusion therefore we believe a repeated dose at 12â€“24â€‰hours would not be indicated. This dose regime (0.4 Î¼g/kg body weight administered by intravenous infusion) is recommended in American neurocritical care guidelines for the treatment of intracranial haemorrhage,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> although the level of evidence supporting this recommendation was recognised as very uncertain.</p>

                <p>Participantsâ€™ age, sex, medical history, antiplatelet drug use, ICH location, intraventricular haemorrhage and mRS will be assessed at baseline by local investigators. Participants will be reviewed again on day 2, hospital discharge and on day 90 to gather information on interventions, adverse events, discharge date and discharge destination. Data collection forms can be found in online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dash-1.ac.uk/">https://dash-1.ac.uk/</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>At day 90 central assessors trained in the appropriate questionnaires and masked to treatment allocation will follow-up each patient by telephone. Barthel index, mRS, EuroQOL, cognition (mini-mental state examination) and serious adverse events will be assessed by telephone.</p>
                <p>Brain imaging (CT head) will be undertaken as part of routine care before enrolment. A second research CT head scan will be performed 24â€‰hours after treatment with the IMP to measure parenchymal haematoma volume. Haematoma volume will be measured centrally by trained assessors masked to treatment allocation using semi-automated segmentation. We will assess change in haematoma volume at 24â€‰hours, and proportion of patients with haematoma expansion, defined as an absolute increase of greater than 6â€‰mL or relative growth of greater than 33%.</p>
                <p>To assess baseline platelet function, platelets will be stimulated with arachidonic acid (which is inhibited by aspirin) or adenosine diphosphate (which is inhibited by P2Y12 inhibitors). Platelet cell surface P-selectin expression (a measure of platelet activation) will then be measured using a standardised assay (Heptinstall; patent pending (PTC/GB2008/050169)) to assess retrospectively whether patients were taking antiplatelet drugs, as previously described.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> VWF antigen, VWF activity and factor VIII (1-stage) will be measured centrally by assessors masked to treatment allocation. Blood samples will be drawn into 0.109M citrate and centrifuged at 2500g for 15â€‰min. Platelet poor plasma will be aspirated and stored at âˆ’80Â°C at each site and then transferred to the central laboratory at the end of the trial for analysis. These tests will be performed for research only and the results will not be fed back to the clinical team.

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be agreed prior to database lock and release of randomisation codes. The trial will be reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines including the extension to pilot and feasibility trials, as appropriate.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> This is a feasibility trial and the main analysis will be with descriptive statistics only. Counts will be summarised using N and %, and continuous variables will be summarised using means and SD or medians and IQRs depending on their distribution. While some variables will be summarised by treatment group, no formal statistical comparisons will be made and any analyses will be considered purely exploratory. We will assess the feasibility of recruiting, treating and following up patients from 10 centres over 1â€‰year. We will estimate a recruitment rate, treatment rate and follow-up rate. It is likely that a large definitive trial would be feasible if at least 50 participants were recruited into this study, that compliance with randomised treatment was high and that a high proportion of follow-up data were available. Lower recruitment would not preclude progression if there was some evidence that the barriers to recruitment identified could be overcome. A decision about feasibility for a larger trial will be made in conjunction with the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) taking into account recruitment rates, differences between centres and other relevant information.</p>
                <p>This is a feasibility trial and as such will have no formal assessment of efficacy. The proposed primary efficacy outcome in a definitive trial would be death or dependency at day 90, measured using the mRS. Shifts in the mRS will be summarised for this trial but no formal confirmatory statistical analyses will be performed. Similarly, all other efficacy variables will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Serious adverse events will be summarised using descriptive statistics according to the treatment the participant received. Missing data will be reported. The investigation of this data and methods implemented to address the missing data, if appropriate, will be detailed in the SAP.</p>
                <p>All available data will be used including overall numbers of patients presenting in clinic and screening data (where available). Where summaries by treatment group are provided, these will be based on an intention to treat population that is, according to the treatment the participant was randomised to, with the exception of safety data. A safety population will be defined to summarise the safety data in this study where participants will be summarised according to the treatment they received irrespective of randomisation. Summaries of the number and proportion of participants who would form a per protocol population in a larger trial, and reasons for exclusion from a per protocol population will be provided to allow future planning.

                <p>Since this is a feasibility study with one of the objectives being to determine potential recruitment rates, a formal sample size calculation is not appropriate. If more than 50 participants were randomised from 10 centres in a 12-month period, it is likely that, assuming similar recruitment rates in additional centres, a larger study recruiting approximately 1200 participants in around 50 centres recruiting for 60 months would be feasible. Depending on the final sample size calculation for the definitive study, the number of centres and recruitment period could be determined using the information from the rates and patterns observed in the feasibility study. Information about set up times for centres will also better inform recruitment projections for a larger study. TICH-2 and other studies indicate approximately 25% of all people presenting with ICH are taking antiplatelet drugs.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>

                <p>This study was developed in collaboration with, and is supported by Nottingham Stroke Research Partnership Group, made up of stroke survivors and carers. Members of the group have reviewed the proposed study, and in an iterative process, commented on its design and conduct. In particular, the group has influenced the approach to taking informed consent within the study. In addition, the proposal was also reviewed by the Research to Understand Stroke due to Haemorrhage patient reference group in Edinburgh (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/research/diagnoses-diseasetargets/rush/rush-patient-reference-group">http://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences/research/diagnoses-diseasetargets/rush/rush-patient-reference-group</ext-link>).</p>

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the data at 6â€‰months. Study data will be collected, monitored and analysed in Nottingham. The data management policy is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dash-1.ac.uk/docs/public.php">http://dash-1.ac.uk/docs/public.php</ext-link>. The trial will be run in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The DASH trial has been granted ethics approval by the East Midlandsâ€”Nottingham 2 research ethics committee (18/EM/0184). The trial has been adopted in the UK by the National Institute for Health and Care Research.</p>
                <p>Trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Reporting will be in compliance with CONSORT<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> recommendations. When the study is complete summary findings will be posted on the patient support group website. Findings will also be presented at conferences such as the UK Stroke Forum, European Stroke Conference, World Stroke Congress, British Society for Haematology annual meeting and International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis annual meeting.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This will be the first randomised controlled trial comparing desmopressin to placebo for patients with ICH who are taking antiplatelet drugs. ICH is a common cause of death and disability worldwide. Patients taking antiplatelet drugs are more likely to have haematoma expansion and to have poorer outcomes than those who are not taking an antiplatelet drug. Early treatment with drugs to reduce the effect of antiplatelet drugs may reduce haematoma expansion. Desmopressin is a promising drug, which is commonly used in the treatment of inherited bleeding disorders and may reduce the effects of antiplatelet drugs.</p>
              <p>In this trial we aim to determine if it is feasible to administer desmopressin within 24â€‰hours to patients with ICH taking an antiplatelet drug. One potential barrier is that some patients will have delayed presentations to hospital. For those that reach hospital within 24â€‰hours, we have aimed to make recruitment to the trial streamlined by minimising barriers to recruitment. This includes use of broad inclusion criteria and using a simple trial design. The design of this trial is based on the successful TICH-2<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and PATCH<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> multicentre trials. The use of consent from a relative, close friend or professional representative is essential in this trial because the majority of patients will lack capacity.</p>
              <p>If it proves feasible to run a trial of desmopressin compared with placebo for these patients then we aim to proceed to a large efficacy study. This will have an important impact on clinical practice. Desmopressin is widely available and inexpensive. It has the potential to reduce the risk of death and disability for patients with ICH who are taking antiplatelet drugs. Desmopressin could be rapidly adopted into clinical guidelines if it proves to reduce the risk of death or disability for patients with ICH.</p>
