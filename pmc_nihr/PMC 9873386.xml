                  <p>SlowMo is the first blended digital therapy for paranoia, showing significant small‐moderate reductions in paranoia in a recent large‐scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). This study explored the subjective service‐user experience of the SlowMo therapy content and design; the experience of the blended therapy approach, including the triangle of the therapeutic alliance; and the experience of the digital aspects of the intervention.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants were 22 adult service users with schizophrenia‐spectrum psychosis and persistent distressing paranoia, who completed at least one SlowMo therapy session and a 24‐week follow‐up, at one of 3 sites in Oxford, London, and Sussex, UK. They were interviewed by peer researchers, using a topic guide co‐produced by the Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) team. The transcribed data were analysed thematically. Multiple coding and triangulation, and lay peer researcher validation were used to reach a consensus on the final theme structure.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Six core themes were identified: (i) starting the SlowMo journey; (ii) the central role of the supportive therapist; (iii) slowing things down; (iv) value and learning from social connections; (v) approaches and challenges of technology; and (vi) improvements in paranoia and well‐being.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>For these service users, slowing down for a moment was helpful, and integrated into thinking over time. Learning from social connections reflected reduced isolation, and enhanced learning through videos, vignettes, and peers. The central role of the supportive therapist and the triangle of alliance between service user, therapist, and digital platform were effective in promoting positive therapeutic outcomes.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Paranoia, or fear of harm from others, is common, occurring frequently in as many as 20% of the general population and up to 70% of people with non‐affective psychosis, and severely impacting mental health and quality of life (Coid et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Freeman &amp; Garety, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Freeman et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Johns et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Yet there are issues with the delivery and uptake of standard psychological therapies for paranoia and psychosis (Greenwood et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In addition, meta‐analyses of traditional cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for psychosis therapies have revealed only small–moderate effects on delusions and positive symptoms (e.g. Bighelli et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Small to moderate treatment effect sizes have also recently been found for the impact on the paranoia of briefer causal‐interventionist therapies that specifically target sleep, worry, and self‐schema, with much greater effects on the specifically targeted process (Freeman et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>). However, the psychological mechanisms underpinning paranoia, also comprise reasoning biases of jumping to conclusions (fast decision making based on limited evidence), and reduced belief flexibility (meta‐cognitive ability to reflect on and adjust beliefs) (Garety &amp; Freeman, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Garety et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ward &amp; Garety, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Targeting these mechanisms, in a brief engaging, digitally supported intervention might enhance both engagement and paranoia outcomes.</p>
              <p>SlowMo therapy takes a causal‐interventionist approach, focusing on underlying causal mechanisms and is the first blended (therapist delivered and technology‐enhanced) digital therapy for paranoia. It involves 8 cognitive‐behavioural sessions that target ‘fast thinking’ reasoning biases that are thought to underlie paranoia (Garety et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), by encouraging people to slow down for a moment and find ways of feeling safer. Sessions are assisted by the SlowMo ‘webapp’, delivered via touchscreen laptop, which has interactive features including animated vignettes and personalized thought ‘bubbles’, and by a mobile phone app which provides access to SlowMo strategies in daily life. The therapy is brief, so has the potential to support access to therapy for a larger number of service users than current provisions, and is designed in line with recommendations for improving implementation of digital therapies for psychosis (Allan et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Berry et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Sarkar et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The structured blended approach, with face to face sessions supported by session‐by‐session digital content reduces the risk of therapist drift (Kooistra et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and the inclusive human‐centred‐design (Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), aims to ensure the therapy is usable, trustworthy, enjoyable, personalized, normalizing, and offers flexible interpersonal support. The recent large‐scale SlowMo randomized controlled trial clearly indicated that SlowMo was beneficial, with 10 /11 paranoia measures at 12 weeks, and 8/11 at 24 weeks demonstrating significant small‐moderate effects in 181 participants with schizophrenia‐spectrum psychosis in London, Sussex, and Oxford compared to 180 participants who received usual care alone (Garety et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Improvements were also found on measures of self‐esteem, worry, well‐being, and quality of life.</p>
              <p>In addition to the positive effects on paranoia and well‐being, understanding service user experiences of therapy are also critical. The therapeutic alliance is one aspect of the service user experience, which can have a causal impact on the effectiveness of treatments in psychosis (Goldsmith et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Indeed, alliance with online digital interventions may promote better engagement (Clarke et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Historically, the therapeutic alliance is defined as the quality of the working relationship, or connection, between service user and therapist, that aims to produce positive therapeutic outcomes, through shared goals, tasks, and bonds characterized by interest, warmth, empathy, authenticity, genuine concern, understanding, and hope (Bordin, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; Henson et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Lopez et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In blended therapies, this working relationship is extended to a ‘triangle of alliance’ between the service user, clinician, and digital platform (Cavanagh, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); the digital therapeutic alliance being the therapeutic connection between the user and the mental health app (D'Alfonso et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The working relationship with the therapist remains a predictor of change (Vernmark et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) but the alliance can be further enhanced by the incorporation of technology, leading to greater commitment to goals and tasks (Lopez, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Alliance varies across platforms and levels of therapist involvement, and alliance with digital platforms independently predicts engagement and outcome (Cavanagh et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In SlowMo therapy, the triangle of the alliance is extended to include both the service user and therapist connection with the web app, but also the mobile phone app within and outside of sessions.</p>
              <p>Data on the user experience of digital therapy in psychosis is only recently emerging, focused largely online and the mobile phone supported self‐management (Berry et al.,<xref rid="papt12393-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Service users with psychosis have reported a sense of autonomy and control while using self‐guided digital health apps to manage their symptoms (Berry et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A proof‐of‐concept trial found high feasibility and acceptability, and large treatment effects for a self‐guided smartphone app (Acticisst) compared to a symptom tracking app (Bucci et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>), whilst a smartphone and web‐based cognitive self‐management app (FOCUS) found that 87% of app users found it easy to use and 87% found it helpful for symptoms, but some reported difficulties with the technology and requested more technical support (Ben‐Zeev et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>There is still much to be understood about the implementation of digital interventions for psychosis. Whilst implementation frameworks have been created (Allan et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), no study to our knowledge has yet evaluated a blended therapy with digitally supported face‐to‐face therapy sessions for paranoia. Research has demonstrated excellent adherence to SlowMo sessions and the mobile phone app, and self‐reported ease‐of‐use, usefulness, and enjoyment (Garety et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). SlowMo therapy design was able to bridge the ‘digital divide’ (Robotham et al, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), whereby people from minority populations report lower digital literacy, as age and ethnicity did not impact user experience (Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Given recommendations from researchers to employ multidimensional objective and subjective assessments of user experience to support implementation, in light of suboptimal uptake and use of mental health apps (Ng et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), this qualitative study evaluates service users’ subjective experience of and alliance with the SlowMo therapy, including therapist, digital elements, and their interaction.</p>

                <p>The study is a co‐produced thematic analysis of service user experiences of SlowMo therapy in UK mental health services. The data collection, analysis, and interpretation were co‐produced with peer researchers, to enhance the methodological rigour and provide a rich subjective perspective, as service users may be more forthcoming when interviewed by peers (Simpson &amp; House, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and peer researcher involvement in the analysis may lead to the identification of novel themes and reflections (Gillard et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).

                <p>Participants were 22 service users recruited for the SlowMo RCT at the 3 sites (London, Sussex, and Oxford). Sampling was consecutive and purposive: participants were invited to take part in the qualitative sub‐study consecutively, following completion of (i) at least one SlowMo session and (ii) the 24‐week follow‐up. Additional inclusion criteria were the same as for the main trial: aged ≥18 years; persistent (3+ months) distressing paranoia (assessed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry [<xref rid="papt12393-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>]; scoring &gt;29 on the Green et al.

                <p>A topic guide for the qualitative interviews was initially drafted by the study team to enable a detailed evaluation of the user experience of the therapy, therapist, and technology. It was revised iteratively in collaboration with the SlowMo PPI team, initially in 2 central PPI meetings to which all 9 PPI members were invited (6 women and 3 men, from Sussex (3), Oxford (2), and London (4)), and subsequently in a series of local PPI meetings, by the PPI interviewers (1 woman in Oxford, 1 woman/1 man in Sussex, and 1 woman in London), who revised it further for flow and ease of use.

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>PPI team members received either the SlowMo therapy as part of a previous project, or an introduction to the therapy and materials at the start of the current project, to enable them to better understand and contextualize the interview discussions. They also received training in peer researcher roles and role‐play practice in conducting qualitative interviews using the topic guide. Supervision was provided by the PPI lead (Sussex) or trial coordinators (London/Oxford). After gaining additional written informed consent for participation in the qualitative study, all interview data were collected in‐person, either by 2 peer researchers working together (Sussex) or by 1 peer worker and a graduate researcher (London and Oxford). Participants were reimbursed £20 for their time. All interviews were audio‐recorded with the exception of one (see below) and transcribed verbatim.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>A thematic analysis was applied to the transcribed data, using a constructionist framework in 6 steps: familiarization, initial coding, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining, and naming themes, and producing the report (Braun &amp; Clarke, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The data were analysed in two phases: each comprised 11 transcripts, and used multiple coders and triangulation to reach a consensus on theme structure. In the first phase, an independent graduate psychologist, clinical, and peer researchers, and site co‐ordinator/trial therapists each coded the same transcript and met to agree with the initial coding frame. Further transcripts were coded by the graduate psychologist and clinical researcher. Codes were summarized and reviewed by the wider group to clarify the theme structure. The graduate psychologist and clinical researcher then coded the remaining transcripts to produce the phase 1 theme structure. The second phase was conducted by a second graduate researcher, mirroring the phase 1 approach. The two coding frames were then combined. Discrepancies between phases 1 and 2 were discussed, quotes were reviewed, and the consensus was reached on theme descriptors. Finally, themes and quotes were presented to the whole PPI team in two meetings across all sites for final validation.</p>

                <title>Epistemological position</title>
                <p>Lack of consistency and coherence in thematic analysis (Holloway &amp; Todres, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) can be reduced through the transparent application of an epistemological position that underpins study findings (Nowell et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The study is underpinned by a critical realist perspective (Bhaskar, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Collier, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), which recognizes that whilst reality exists, knowledge is socially produced and influenced by the observer's context and worldview (Bhaskar, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ponterotto, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). There may be multiple equally valid accounts of the same phenomenon (Hammersley, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) such that reality is only imperfectly known (Letourneau &amp; Allen, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Porter, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Multiple approaches were taken to best capture the reality of participant perspectives, including data collection by peer researchers, multiple coding of themes from different perspectives, triangulation which is a process of discussion to reach consensus on theme structure involving all peers and researchers, final validation, and transparency in reporting.</p>

                <p>The peer researchers were not experienced in qualitative research and brought a ‘lay’ perspective to the approach, but they had worked as SlowMo PPI members for 1.5 years before they commenced data collection, and 2 of the 4 peer researchers had received a version of SlowMo therapy.

                <p>The primary coder in phase 1 was independent of the SlowMo study, which enabled objectivity and reduced the risk of bias, but also limited understanding of participants’ responses, and required discussion with the broader study team.

              <p>Of 28 eligible participants approached in Sussex and London, 5 declined to participate, and 3 were unreachable. One did not consent to audio‐recording, and notes were taken during their interview instead. Two additional participants took part from Oxford to give 22 participants, comprising 12.2% of the total SlowMo therapy sample. Basic demographic details are provided in Table <xref rid="papt12393-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Some data are not presented individually to preserve anonymity. Eighteen were male (82%), 18 were White British (82%), 19 were single (86%), 17 were unemployed (77%), and 14 lived alone (64%). Only 3 participants (14%) had received education beyond A levels. Their mean age was 44.9 years (range 20–64), and their mean GPTS Part B score was 51.8 (range 29–79). The qualitative sample was broadly representative of the whole therapy sample, which had slightly fewer men (70%), slightly more ethnic diversity (70%) and unemployment (80%), slightly fewer people living alone (58%), a slightly lower average age (42.6), and slightly higher GPTS Part B score (56.2) (Garety et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p>

                <p>The final theme structure comprised 6 core themes and 20 sub‐themes. Two core themes remained unchanged from phase 1 to 2 (‘Slowing things down’ and ‘Improvements in paranoia and well‐being’), the wording changed slightly for one (‘Starting the SlowMo journey’); the wording and focus (changed slightly for another ‘Approaches and challenges of Technology’). The final two themes became more distinct: ‘Feeling connected and understood’ became ‘Value and learning from social connections’; ‘Drivers of Progress’ became specifically, ‘The central role of the supportive therapist relationship’. Of the final 20 sub‐themes, 6 were identical from phase 1 to phase 2, 9 changed wording or focus, and 5 were new in phase 2.</p>
                <p>Figure <xref rid="papt12393-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a representation of the organization of the core themes. The initial theme captures the experience of (i) starting the SlowMo Journey. The inner two themes, depicted in orange, reflect core and unique elements of the SlowMo therapy as perceived by service users: (iii) slowing themes down and (iv) value and learning from social connections. The two flanking themes, (ii) the Central role of the supportive therapist relationship and, (v) approaches and challenges of technology, emphasize the critical connections with both therapist and technology in leading to the therapeutic outcomes of (vi) Improvements in Paranoia and well‐being.</p>

                  <p>People described that the SlowMo therapy was something offered and encouraged by clinicians. It felt like an opportunity to try something new and potentially helpful. It created a mix of emotions. Some people described hope and readiness, especially if they felt they had been stuck with their experiences for a long time. Other people felt nerves and uncertainty about meeting someone new, and if they struggled with voices and anxiety. Importantly, no nerves or uncertainty were expressed in relation to use of technology. For many, this was their first therapy experience.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This study provided an in‐depth exploration of the subjective user experience of SlowMo therapy and generated insights to aid future development and support implementation. The 6 core themes captured (i) the experiences of starting the SlowMo journey; (ii) the central role of the supportive therapist as a guide to accessing the therapy and technology; (iii) the approaches and challenges in the use of the technology; (iv) key features of the therapy including slowing things down, which was learnt and internalized through time and practice; and (v) the value and learning achieved through relating to the vignette characters, which helped to normalize experiences and model coping strategies. Finally, (vi) positive impacts of the SlowMo therapy were reported for paranoia, worry, other mental health difficulties, engagement with social and daily life, confidence, and a positive outlook for the future.</p>
              <p>Primary reasons for starting the SlowMo therapy were often a sense of feeling stuck and an opportunity for help. One peer researcher noted that ‘people on the SlowMo trial had not generally been offered any other therapies’. Some of the quotes make it clear that problems had never been discussed before.</p>
              <p>Consistent with other blended therapies (Vernmark et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), the presence of the therapist during the session was viewed as central to the process. The therapist was seen as crucial in bridging the link between the service user and the technical features of the app, which in turn led to more favourable experiences of the technology, cementing the triangle of alliance (Cavanagh, <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The majority opinion was that the digital component of the therapy augmented the rich therapeutic relationship, as opposed to the app being seen as central (Aref‐Adib et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This is supported by a recent systematic review which found that when peer‐to‐peer interactions on mHealth apps were not moderated by clinicians or researchers, the retention rates slipped from very high (94.5%) to very low (14%), highlighting the role of the therapist in improving adherence (Biagianti et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Importantly in the current study, participants also described a relationship with the phone app itself. The app reminded participants of the learning gained in therapy and became a ‘best friend’ for one person.</p>
              <p>As therapy progressed, multiple participants in this sub‐study, found that the interactive multimedia features of the vignettes made them feel more connected and understood, and less isolated in their experiences. Studies have shown that participants enjoy digital platforms which are tailored, personalized, and communicative (Berry et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Some participants learned and retained their therapy skills better by observing the animated vignettes, and several participants requested further tailoring through a greater variety of characters, covering a broader set of worries that occur in paranoia. This experience of viewing others who are coping with similar experiences to oneself is an important factor that enhances acceptability and engagement with interventions (Biagianti et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>Many participants recognized the importance of slowing down thinking and were able to modify their thinking style to be more flexible and to seek more information. This is consistent with the main RCT finding that the SlowMo therapy increased belief flexibility and slow thinking compared to treatment as usual (Garety et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p>
              <p>The within‐app thought bubbles helped to develop skills to slow down thinking, and were an accessible resource that offered coping strategies. Participants were more likely to use the app earlier in the therapy, when paranoia was arguably more acute, with use appearing to reduce as participants’ mental state improved, and new thinking processes became internalized. This is consistent with the concept of e‐attainment of personal goals when these have been sufficiently supported (Sanatkar et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>While SlowMo offers a normalizing, supportive platform for participants, some described that suspiciousness and pre‐existing views towards technology might affect use. This is consistent with previous reports (Aref‐Adib et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), although importantly, baseline paranoia did not predict adherence to or self‐reported user experiences of the SlowMo app (Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). The stigma surrounding mental health continued to be a barrier, especially for people suffering from paranoia, who on occasion felt self‐conscious when using the app in public. Participants also described technical challenges, as expected given the trial tested a working prototype (minimal viable product) of SlowMo therapy (Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Technical recommendations have been integrated into a product specification for an updated version of SlowMo therapy; including improved syncing of content from computer to the mobile app, increased font size, additional instruction guide (on‐boarding) for use of the mobile phone app, and coding to enable cross‐platform use of the mobile app. These recommendations are consistent with previously published recommendations to support the implementation of digital health interventions, whereby interventions that are adaptable to users’ needs and available on participants’ own phones led to better engagement (Aref‐Adib et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>Lastly, participants reported improvements in paranoia, worry, confidence, distress, outlook, and social life, mirroring the quantitative results from the main trial which showed positive impacts of the therapy on paranoia and worry alongside other well‐being, self‐concept, and quality of life outcomes (Garety et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The therapy proved to have far‐reaching impacts: participants mentioned enhanced social lives, and improved co‐existing conditions, in keeping with the broad pattern of improvements across secondary outcomes reported in the main trial. Participants reported increased self‐confidence and better management of other stresses, which is consistent with the use of technology to promote a sense of autonomy, and for mobile phone apps to offer real‐time help (Bucci et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>).</p>
              <p>To conclude, participants of the SlowMo therapy reported a positive experience of the digitally supported therapy, reductions in paranoia, and improved overall well‐being. This was linked to feeling understood, relating to vignettes, accepting and learning a new slow thinking style, and being supported by a therapist to reinforce their learning through the therapy sessions and mobile phone app use.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This is the first study to gather detailed personal and contextual information to aid understanding of the factors influencing subjective user‐experience of a specific blended digital therapy for paranoia. The data were gathered from a representative sample of over 12% of all participants randomized to SlowMo therapy. Peer researchers co‐delivered the study, conducted all interviews with participants, and co‐produced the final thematic analysis, which it is hoped, enhanced the robustness of the results and the validity of the service user perspective. A number of steps were taken during the course of the analysis to enhance the overall rigor of the study and limit sources of bias. The initial coding was conducted by an independent researcher, with multiple coding and triangulation to reach a consensus on the theme structure. Regular meetings involved a diverse mix of professionals, and peer researchers to ensure that participants’ responses were considered from a variety of viewpoints.</p>
                <p>The participants recruited in previous qualitative studies (e.g. Aref‐Adib et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Bucci et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>) were mostly young, digital‐natives with a mean age of 28 and 26 years, respectively. A systematic review found that younger ‘at risk’ or first‐episode psychosis individuals used the internet and mobile technologies for their mental health difficulties more frequently than those with longer‐term psychosis (Killikelly et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The mean age of SlowMo participants was 45, thus a notable aspect of the current study was the broadly positive experience of blended therapy in this older age group. This is further supported by a linked study that showed no impact of the digital divide, as neither age, ethnicity nor paranoia impacted adherence to or user experience of the SlowMo mobile app (Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p>
                <p>Limitations included the limited sampling of participants from one site, and limited ethnic diversity, in this qualitative study, especially from black ethnic groups, who reported lower computer access, smartphone use, and confidence prior to therapy in a linked study (Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). In addition, only 4 participants (18%) were female. The diversity of the sample with respect to digital literacy, digital access, socioeconomic status, and cognitive ability was not investigated in this qualitative study, although it was investigated in the linked SlowMo study (Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Although participants were invited consecutively, it is unclear whether those who agreed to take part were those who were more positive about the therapy. Finally, the derived themes reflected a majority view of the participants in this study but did not necessarily reflect the views of all participants in this study or indeed in the main trial.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>These findings offer valuable insights into participants’ experiences with SlowMo therapy. Importantly, many participants described feeling stuck prior to starting the therapy. They valued the central role of the supportive therapist who guided them through the therapy, and the use of the technology. They described that key concepts of slow and fast thinking were helpful, and they valued learning from the connections with the vignette characters. The relationship with the mobile phone app was experienced positively. Furthermore, the integration of the slow thinking style over time in a form of e‐attainment (whereby technology has sufficiently supported the attainment of therapy goals or skills) may have contributed to the subjective improvements in paranoia, well‐being, and social integration, and reductions in worry, stress, and depression. In this respect, the ‘triangle of alliance’ between service users, therapists, and digital platforms appeared to be highly effective, and there was a clear sense of a shared bond, goals, and tasks to support improved paranoia and mental well‐being. In the future, blended therapies for psychosis may benefit from a wide variety of true stories and experiences on which service users’ could model their recovery, to optimize impact. Important reflections were provided on the less visible personal and social barriers that affect the uptake of digital therapies such as the need for further instructions on how to use mobile phone apps, preferences for using apps on one's own phone, and the impact on usage pattern when symptoms become acute. This study in combination with the quantitative user experience study (Hardy et al., <xref rid="papt12393-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) provides critical information to support the development of the next iteration of the SlowMo and other blended therapies for future implementation in clinical practice.</p>

All of the questions are guidance for what you might say to a service user in an interview. The bold questions are important to ask and the remaining questions are prompts that you might find helpful, dependent on what the person has already told you.</p>
                  <p>INTRODUCTIONS: The following questions ask for your opinions about what it was like for you to attend SlowMo therapy sessions with [therapist name]. Your responses will be used to help us to understand more about what it is like to do this new therapy and how it might be improved.
