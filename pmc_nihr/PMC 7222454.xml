                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common knee injury that can lead to poor quality of life, decreased activity and increased risk of secondary osteoarthritis of the knee. Management of patients with a non-acute ACL injury can include a non-surgical (rehabilitation) or surgical (reconstruction) approach. However, insufficient evidence to guide treatment selection has led to high variation in treatment choice for patients with non-acute presentation of ACL injury.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">The objective of the ACL SNNAP trial is to determine in patients with non-acute anterior cruciate ligament deficiency (ACLD) whether a strategy of non-surgical management (rehabilitation) (with option for later ACL reconstruction only if required) is more clinically effective and cost effective than a strategy of surgical management (reconstruction) without prior rehabilitation with all patients followed up at 18 months.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The study is a pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority, randomised controlled trial with two-arm parallel groups and 1:1 allocation. Patients with a symptomatic non-acute ACL deficient knee will be randomised to either non-surgical management (rehabilitation) or surgical management (reconstruction). We aim to recruit 320 patients from approximately 30 secondary care orthopaedic units from across the United Kingdom. Randomisation will occur using a web-based randomisation system. Blinding of patients and clinicians to treatment allocation will not be possible because of the nature of the interventions. Participants will be followed up via self-reported questionnaires at 6, 12 and 18 months. The primary outcome is the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 18 months post randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include a return to sport/activity, intervention-related complications, patient satisfaction, expectations of activity, generic health quality of life, knee specific quality of life and resource usage.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">At present, no evidence-based treatment of non-acute ACL deficiency exists, particularly in the NHS. Moreover, little consensus exists on the management approach for these patients. The proposed trial will address this gap in knowledge regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of ACL treatment and inform future standards of care for this condition.</p>

              <title>Background and rationale</title>
              <p id="Par19">Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury, mainly affecting young, active individuals with estimated 200,000 injuries annually in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. ACL injury can have a profound effect on knee kinematics (knee movement and forces), with recurrent knee instability (giving way) as the main problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, the injury can lead to poor quality of life, decreased activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and increased risk of secondary osteoarthritis of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Some patients, once recovered from the initial injury, are able to function well without their ACL (copers), usually after undergoing some formal rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Other patients continue with episodes of knee instability, and surgery (ACL reconstruction using a graft) is thought necessary to stabilise the knee.</p>
              <p id="Par20">In the United Kingdom, a surgical management strategy has become the preferred treatment for individuals with ACL injuries. Our recent survey shows that the ratio of surgical intervention to non-surgical conservative intervention is 4:1 (unpublished data). Our data suggest that 80% of non-acute patients are now directly listed for surgery in the NHS. In England, an estimated 15,000 primary ACL reconstruction surgeries are performed each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, this is a modest estimate based on Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, and the real figure for a UK population of 63 million may be closer to 50,000 pa (based on Swedish ACL registry data - incidence 71/100,000 pa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Based on the conservative estimate (<italic>n</italic> = 15,000), the costs of ACL reconstruction to the NHS in 2015 was approximately £63 million.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Despite ACL reconstruction being common, the current management for ACL injury is based on limited evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A Cochrane systematic review examined whether surgery or non-surgical (conservative) management was superior for ACL injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and concluded no high-quality evidence exists on which to base practice. This uncertainty in the treatment of ACL patients is supported by the findings on the UK Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treatment NHS (DUETS). Surgical stabilisation of the knee joint appears a beneficial intervention, but whether the surgery is more beneficial than non-surgical intervention is unclear, particularly in the non-acute patient.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The unsupported preference for surgical management of the ACL deficient knee has recently been questioned further by evidence obtained in a Scandinavian trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The benefit of surgery, for all injured patients, was shown to be uncertain, with an operation being unnecessary in many cases. Frobell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] showed that a period of prior rehabilitation before considering operation can reduce ACL surgery by up to 50%. The clinical implication is that a period of rehabilitation should always be offered prior to surgical reconstruction, and this has become accepted practice, particularly with isolated ACL tears without comorbidity. However, whilst this clinical decision making evidence is valid for acutely injured individuals, it is not considered applicable to those more typically seen in the NHS, where patients are often non-acute, having sustained injury sometime earlier. By the time NHS patients are diagnosed and begin dedicated ACL injury management, up to 12 months can have passed since initial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">The mixed acknowledgement and uptake of this evidence and the uncertainty over the applicability to a less acute UK population has resulted in a highly varied approach to managing ACL injury in the NHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An overuse of surgical management may occur in the non-acute population, yet conversely, an argument may be made to bypass any formal rehabilitation and undergo immediate reconstructive surgery. Which strategy is the most clinically and cost effective remains unknown. Because surgery is expensive and may also have greater complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], generating evidence for automatic default ACL reconstruction is even more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Likewise, the routine prescription of formal rehabilitation, if not beneficial, is considered wasteful and may disadvantage individuals with ACL injuries. The need exists to identify the most appropriate treatment strategy.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In terms of current research, a review of the Clinical Trials Registry found one other study examining the clinical and cost effectiveness of two treatment strategies for ACL rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This trial is being carried out in the Netherlands and has a sample size of 188 participants. As it also evaluates the newly injured (acute) patients, this study replicates the Scandinavian study setting and, again, cannot be directly applied to the typical NHS pathway.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In summary, at present no evidence-base management of non-acute ACL deficiency is occurring, particularly in the NHS. Moreover, little consensus exists on the management of these patients. The proposed ACL SNNAP trial will address the gap in the evidence base regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of these approaches and inform standards of care for ACL deficiency management in non-acute patients.</p>

                  <p id="Par26">The primary objective of the ACL SNNAP study is to determine in patients with non-acute anterior cruciate ligament deficiency (ACLD) whether a strategy of non-surgical management (rehabilitation) (with option for later ACL reconstruction only if required) is more clinically effective and cost effective than a strategy of surgical management (reconstruction) without prior rehabilitation with all patients followed up at 18 months.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par28">The ACL SNNAP trial is a pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority, randomised controlled trial with 2-arm parallel groups and 1:1 allocation ratio to compare non-surgical management (rehabilitation) or surgical management (reconstruction) options for patients with a symptomatic non-acute ACL deficiency. An internal pilot is included with clear progression criteria regarding recruitment.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec7">
                <title>Internal pilot</title>
                <p id="Par29">A two-stage pilot study will be conducted to ensure recruitment and guarantee progression. For the first stage, the trial will not progress without the recruitment of a minimum of 25 patients (from eight centres) in the first 6 months of being open to recruit to the study. At this stage, a recruitment target for each centre will be at least one participant recruited or evidence provided through screening data of an active approach to recruitment. This will provide early evidence that centres are able to identify and recruit patients. A further review of progress will be made at 1 year from the start of recruitment, where 94 patients (from 12 to 18 sites) will meet the progression criteria, with a target set for each centre open to recruitment to achieve an average of one participant per month. Recruitment and screening data will be monitored at individual sites, and reasons for not meeting the targets, explored. Where applicable and if necessary, the need to substitute sites for those unable to meet the target will be considered.</p>

                <title>Qualitative sub-study</title>
                <p id="Par30">A qualitative study with a subset of trial participants (approx. 30–40) has also been incorporated. This nested study will aim to assess the acceptability and adherence to the treatment interventions in the trial. This approach will facilitate evaluation of the interventions based on the experiences of patients receiving the intervention and will be used to inform the results of the main trial.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par32">A total of 320 patients will be recruited from approximately 30 NHS orthopaedic units, including district general and teaching hospitals, from across the United Kingdom over a period of 2 years. Application to the UK Clinical Research Network (UKCRN) will be made to help facilitate recruitment and support the study.</p>
                <p id="Par33">The sites will be selected on the basis of having an established practice of ACL reconstruction and an experienced ACL reconstruction knee surgeon and physiotherapy team capable of providing contemporary care. All orthopaedic surgeons involved in performing the surgical intervention of the study will be designated as having expertise in soft tissue knee surgery as indicated in the Best Practice for Primary Isolated Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction guidelines (BOA, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]), with a minimum experience of 50 procedures in their career. Non-surgical management (rehabilitation) will be delivered (or closely overviewed) by senior physiotherapists (UK Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) registered) with experience of ACL injury regimens.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Before a site is included, evidence of its patient throughput will be reviewed. In addition, the protocol will be discussed with the clinical team to ensure that it would be feasible to run the study at the site. As the time interval between referral and treatment can be variable in the current care pathway, the time period between randomisation and intervention will be standardised (as much as possible) within the study. Only sites that can offer treatment (ACL surgery or rehabilitation) within the 18 week pathway, (in line with current NHS waiting time targets) will be recruited. In addition, as part of the site selection process, documentary evidence of the use of a rehabilitation protocol that reflects the guidelines set will be required. Agreement to maintain consistency (adhere to the guidelines) with the aspects of the surgical intervention as laid out by the study protocol, will also be a requirement.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Regular contact and support will be maintained with study sites to help ensure that the protocol is carried out as planned.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par52">The study compares two routine and well-established management strategies for patients with symptomatic non-acute ACL deficient knees: a) non-surgical management (rehabilitation) and b) surgical management (reconstruction).</p>
                <p id="Par53">Both interventions are routine NHS treatments. Intervention content is based on a minimal set of pre-established criteria in order to ensure the integrity of the comparison while allowing for varying in practice in delivering the interventions between both surgeons and physiotherapists (see below). This pragmatic approach to the delivery of the intervention will allow the management approach to reflect current practice and outpatient resources within the NHS thus aiding generalisation, yet include minimal levels of standardised quality and content for both interventions.</p>
                <p id="Par54">The description and standardisation of the interventions for the trial has been informed from several sources. These include an overview of the best evidence to date, the results of a survey of ACL surgeons, synthesis of current practice guidelines/rehabilitation protocols from UK Trusts and consensus meetings (surgeon/physiotherapist).</p>
                <p id="Par55">Operations will be carried out according to the discretion of the participating surgeon. Two types of ACL reconstruction are commonplace and acceptable: one using a patella tendon graft and the other using a hamstring graft. The rehabilitation content for the conservative arm will be based on standard care for the participating site. Minimal levels of quality and content have been set for both interventions (see below).
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par56">Non-surgical management (rehabilitation)</p></list-item></list>Patients randomised to rehabilitation will be referred to their nearest physiotherapy department and undergo non-surgical management (rehabilitation) delivered (or closely overviewed) by a senior physiotherapist with experience of ACL injury regimens. The routine rehabilitation protocol used at the participating site will be followed.</p>
                <p id="Par57">As part of the site selection process, documentary evidence of the use of or willingness to adopt a rehabilitation protocol that reflects the guidelines of the mandatory aims/goals set for the study rehabilitation intervention (see below) will be required. Part of the requirement will be for the site to be in a position to provide a minimum of six rehabilitation sessions delivered over at least a 3-month period.</p>
                <p id="Par58">The rehabilitation protocol will include the following components:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par59">Evidence of interventions aimed at achieving the mandatory aims/goals:</p></list-item></list><list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par60">Control of pain and swelling</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par61">Regaining range of movement</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par62">Improving neuromuscular control</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par63">Regaining muscle strength</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par64">Achieving normal gait pattern</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par65">Returning to function/activity/sport</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par66">Clearly identified progression milestones.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par67">Return to sport criteria.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par68">Identification criteria for poor or non-progression.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par69">Rehabilitation protocols commonly used in clinical practice consist of a progressive programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], designed to rebuild muscle strength, re-establish joint mobility and neuromuscular control, and enable patients to decrease the risk of re-injury and return to previous levels of activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par70">As little consensus exists in the literature over the most effective rehabilitation protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], variation in the specific exercises carried out and the use of adjuncts (such as cryotherapy) to reach these aims is permitted. Examples of exercises used to reach the aims will be documented in a physiotherapy case report form (PCRF). Flexibility is permitted to adapt treatment to individual needs with no timelines specified for progression. Evidence of individual progression, however, will be documented in the PCRF. A physiotherapy case report form (PCRF) will be used to facilitate recording of the rehabilitation interventions to monitor for fidelity to these guidelines.</p>
                <p id="Par71">The progress of patients who have been randomised to non-surgical management (rehabilitation) will be monitored by their treating physiotherapist. If, after a minimum period of at least 3 months of rehabilitation (or before, if instability or symptoms are deemed substantial), the participant continues to experience symptomatic knee instability and/or symptoms related to associated pathology, i.e., pain or locking, the suggestion is that the non-surgical management has failed. If the patient meets the criteria listed below, a review appointment with the surgeon will be arranged. If following surgical assessment, a decision is made to proceed with ACL reconstruction surgery, the participant will be listed for surgery, as per usual practice.</p>
                <p id="Par72">All other clinical follow up will occur as per routine practice at each participating site. The criteria for change in status (from non-surgical to surgical intervention) after a minimum of 3 months of rehabilitation were confirmed at a consensus meeting (surgeon/physiotherapist) 20 January 2016. The consensus group agreed that 3 months is considered the minimal time needed for the rehabilitation to provide any effect. The criteria for surgery include one or more of the following:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par73">Continued feeling of knee instability and/or symptoms, i.e., pain or locking, related to the associated pathology</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par74">At least two episodes of physical giving way of the knee</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par75">Unable to return to a Tegner activity level 2 points below pre-injury status</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par76">Outside early conversions (inside 3 months), the above criteria assume all patients will have undergone a comprehensive rehabilitation regime according to the study protocol – the physiotherapy case report form will provide evidence of completion and fidelity.</p>
                <p id="Par77">The operation case report form (OCRF), detailed below, will be used to document the operation and monitor compliance with the intervention guidelines. Post-operative rehabilitation will also be recorded for this group.

                <p id="Par79">Patients randomised to reconstructive surgery will be placed on a waiting list to undergo a standard ACL reconstruction procedure (ACLR). All surgical reconstructions will be patella tendon or hamstring tendon, depending on the surgeon’s preference. Any physiotherapy advice and any treatment aimed at the acute presentation (i.e., swelling, regaining range of motion, etc.) prior to surgery can be given, but no formal ACL rehabilitation programme or specific ACL remedial exercise prescription beyond basic maintenance exercises. All other care will be routine, including immediate post-operative care.</p>
                <p id="Par80">For the purpose of this pragmatic trial, the surgical ACL reconstruction will be performed according to standard local policy, provided the minimal quality and care components as described below are consistent.</p>
                <p id="Par81">All patients will undergo pre-operative evaluation to assess their clinical condition and co-morbidities. During the trial, the operative intervention will take place adhering to their local trust policies for anaesthesia, DVT prophylaxis and antibiotic use.</p>
                <p id="Par82">Surgery will be performed or supervised in theatre by a specialised consultant knee surgeon with recognised expertise in ACLR (will have performed at least 50 previous ACL reconstructions). Patients will be placed supine on the operating table and set up for an arthroscopic knee procedure. Tourniquet use will be applied as per local protocols. The incisions (commonly anteromedial and anterolateral) will be placed at the surgeon’s discretion. Under arthroscopic guidance, any remaining remnants of the torn ligament will be removed, and anatomical landmarks within the knee, identified. The desired graft will be harvested from a separate incision. Using a combination of direct vision and instrumentation, tibial and femoral tunnels will be placed to receive the graft. The graft will be introduced into the pre-prepared tunnels and once it is in situ and under tension, the graft will be fixed in position. Any additional surgery to other structures in the knee, e.g., menisci, will be conducted as per routine practice. All incisions will be sutured and bandaged, as per local protocols.</p>
                <p id="Par83">Patients will be engaged in a post-operative rehabilitation programme as per standard care at the participating hospital. Note the initial content of post-operative physiotherapy is different from that for non-surgical management in that some aspects of graft protection and caution are necessary following ACL reconstruction.</p>
                <p id="Par84">An operation case report form (OCRF) will be used to document the operation and monitor compliance with the intervention guidelines. The content of and attendance (adherence) to the post-operative rehabilitation will also be recorded for this group.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par86">The primary outcome for the study is the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS4) at 18 months post randomisation. This outcome measure is derived from four of five subscales: pain, symptoms, difficulty in sports and recreational activities and knee-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], with scores ranging from 0 to 100, and a higher score indicating better health. KOOS is a validated patient-reported outcome used in ACL research (including recent RCT of acute ACL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and large scale databases, i.e., the National Ligament Registry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]). The KOOS4 is sensitive and specific for detecting functional deficits due to knee instability.</p>
                <p id="Par87">The secondary outcomes are as follows:</p>

The process of patient identification and recruitment will vary depending on the local treatment pathways at each participating site. The flowchart in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> details the recruitment process.

                <p id="Par99">As per routine practice anterior cruciate ligament deficiency (ACLD), either partial or complete tear, will be confirmed at an outpatient appointment through clinical assessment and MRI scan.</p>
                <p id="Par100">Anterior cruciate ligament tears can occur as isolated injuries but more commonly occur in conjunction with injuries to other structures of the knee, including the menisci, articular cartilage and collateral ligaments. Apart from the pathology detailed in the exclusion criteria above, i.e., grade 3 MCL/LCL, associated PCL/PLC and meniscal pathology considered significant enough for immediate repair/resection, all other patients with an ACL tear combined with associated injuries can be considered for participation in the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par101">The participating surgeon or member of the clinical team will initially approach potential participants who meet the eligibility criteria and inform them of the study. Patients who express a potential interest in participating would then be referred to a research nurse/physiotherapist for further details about the study and written information. Patients who wish to participate will complete an informed consent form and baseline questionnaire. If a patient would like more time to consider participation, the research team will agree an arrangement with the patient to confirm their decision.</p>
                <p id="Par102">Situations may arise where a MRI scan is requested by the clinician prior to the confirmation of ACL deficiency. In these cases, information can be provided to the patient to inform them of the study, and possible participation can be discussed once the diagnosis is confirmed.</p>
                <p id="Par103">The baseline questionnaire will include the following outcome measures: KOOS, EQ-5D-5 L, Modified Tegner and ACL-QOL, as detailed in the outcomes section above.

                  <p id="Par126">In total, 320 participants will be recruited to the study. The minimal clinically important change (MIC) for the KOOS score is 8–10 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Estimates of the minimal detectable change (MDC) for the two KOOS subscales most relevant for ACLD vary between five and 12 points (Symptoms 5–9, and Sport/Rec 6–12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A mean target difference of eight points in the primary outcome, KOOS4, along with a standard deviation of 19 (the highest value observed in a trial of acute patients at baseline amongst the KOOS subscales) were assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Given these assumptions, 120 participants per group are required (1:1 allocation, 240 in total) to achieve 90% power at two-sided 5% significance level in the absence of any clustering of outcome. However, to ensure sufficient power, clustering (clsampsi Stata command [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]) has been allowed for by conservatively assuming an intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.06 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and cluster size n, mean (SD) of 26, 5 (12) and 43, 3 (5) for the ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation groups, respectively. This leads to the larger number of 130 participants per group (260), which has just over 80% power. Given the conservative nature of the assumed values and the anticipated gain in precision from adjusting for the baseline scores and other randomisation factors, actual power is likely to be higher even in the presence of clustering. To allow for just over 15% missing data (response in a similar trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]), 320 participants will be needed.</p>
                  <p id="Par127">An interim analysis will be carried out to estimate the magnitude of clustering for the 6 months KOOS4 outcome once data is available for 100 participants.

Sampling uncertainty around the ICER will be explored using non-parametric bootstrapping. Parameter uncertainty will be examined using sensitivity analysis. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be used to estimate the probability of the interventions being cost-effective at a maximum willingness to pay of £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained.</p>
                  <p id="Par134">Potential longer-term cost-effectiveness will be estimated by extrapolating costs and health outcomes beyond the time horizon of 18 months. Extrapolations will be based on a modelling of the rates of re-operations observed in the surgery arm of the trial and subsequent surgeries observed in the rehabilitation arm of the trial.</p>

                <p id="Par148">The study involves routine ACL reconstruction surgery and rehabilitation for the management of symptomatic ACL deficiency. No additional risks to patients exist. The participants will either undergo ACL reconstruction or rehabilitation as per standard management. Patients will be informed of the standard risks associated with anaesthetic and ACL reconstruction operations.</p>
                <p id="Par149">Possible (expected) complications and consequences are as follows:</p>
                <p id="Par150">All ACL reconstruction procedures, whether primary surgery or revision, carry a risk of anaesthesia-related problems, which can include death; morbidity, including wound infection; bleeding, intra- and post-operatively; PE; DVT; confirmed CVA; confirmed MI; and complications secondary to existing co-morbidity, e.g., ischaemic heart disease, septicaemia, the need for blood transfusion and revision operation.</p>
                <p id="Par151">Specific complications following ACL reconstruction procedures include patella fracture, patella tendon avulsion, anterior knee pain, vascular injury and bleeding, femoral tunnel blowout, nerve damage (including numbness or weakness), complex regional pain, lack of extension/fixed flexion deformity, stiffness, infection, graft failure and continued instability, delayed wound healing, continued or worsened pain, fracture, compartment syndrome, swelling, contralateral graft harvest and newly acquired meniscal pathology.</p>
                <p id="Par152">Specific complications following rehabilitation include continued instability and subsequent newly acquired meniscal pathology and pain. These complications may result in the need for further surgery. Details of all complications will be collected and recorded as detailed on a clinical events form. A final readmission checklist will be undertaken by the research staff on hospital records at 18 months post-randomisation to ensure that all complications data is collected from all participants (i.e., those who had not returned a questionnaire). Data from any readmission events identified will be recorded on the clinical events forms.</p>
                <p id="Par153">A serious adverse event for ACL SNNAP is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that was both unexpected and related to the study treatments that 1) resulted in death, 2) was life threatening, 3) required inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation or 4) resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.</p>
                <p id="Par154">If a SAE form is completed detailing any possible related and unexpected SAEs, the chief investigator (CI) or delegate will be notified. If, in the opinion of the local PI and CI, the event is confirmed as being related (resulted from administration of any of the research procedures) and unexpected (i.e., not listed as a possible expected occurrence detailed above), the CI will submit a report to the main REC and the study sponsors within 15 days of the CI becoming aware of it.</p>

Authorship will be determined in accordance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines, and other contributors will be acknowledged.</p>
                <p id="Par157">We plan for the findings to be published in a high impact peer-reviewed journal, which will allow for the results to be disseminated across the orthopaedic and rehabilitation communities, the wider medical community and NICE. In addition, we plan for the findings of the study to be presented at several conferences such as, the annual meeting of the British Association of Knee Surgery (BASK), British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and the Physiotherapy Research Society (PRS). We anticipate the findings will be used to develop evidence-based guidance to inform the management of patients with non-acute ACL deficiency.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par158">The ACL SNNAP trial will aim to address the gap in the evidence base regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of two routine management approaches, non-surgical (rehabilitation) and surgical (reconstruction), and inform standards of care for patients with non-acute ACL deficiency. Conducting trials that include non-surgical and surgical intervention comparators, however, can be challenging. Factors such as crossover between intervention groups, treatment preferences of patients and clinicians, if not adequately addressed, may introduce significant bias and threaten the viability of the trial, and also the validity of the results. Several aspects therefore warrant further discussion in relation to this trial.</p>
              <sec id="Sec49">
                <title>Threats to recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par159">The treatment preference of the population under investigation and the equipoise and preference of the surgeon delivering the intervention are considered as potential threats to recruitment and the successful completion of this study.</p>
                <p id="Par160">Eligible patients for the study will present with non-acute ACL deficiency; that is, they have recovered from any acute symptoms relating to their initial ACL injury. Depending on time since injury, some patients will feel they have already attempted conservative treatment during this period. These patients, who have the potential to be allocated to continued non-surgical treatment, are likely to have a stronger preference for surgery.</p>
                <p id="Par161">On the clinical side, recruiting surgeons are often the primary management decision makers for this population (sometimes with input from therapists). Some issues of bias and preference for surgery may occur in the recruitment process. The internal pilot will evaluate the safeguards established to counteract this potential bias.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec50">
                <title>Compliance to treatment</title>
                <p id="Par162">Compared with trials of similar procedures (for example, two surgical procedures), non-compliance between intervention groups can potentially result in an imbalance between treatment arms in trials comparing non-surgical and surgical procedures, as “crossover” can only occur in one direction (towards surgery). This potential imbalance could result in complexities with interpretation of the results in these types of trials. ACL SNNAP was designed as a management trial with the option for later ACL reconstruction included as part of the Rehabilitation arm, frequent change in status to surgical management from non-surgical management therefore is not considered a threat to study completion or a problem for analysis. The need for surgery, based on the firm standardised criteria outlined in the protocol, would indicate failed management and will be an outcome measure in itself. Obviously, patients will not be able to change from surgery to conservative management once surgery has been performed, in that the operation cannot be undone. However, some patients may wish to change status immediately after randomisation after finding themselves allocated to a (self-perceived) inferior management group. Lessons learnt from previous qualitative work (CSAW study, Arthritis Research UK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] will be utilised to avoid this.</p>

              <sec id="Sec51">
                <title>Loss to follow-up</title>
                <p id="Par163">Data collection for this population—the ACL injury group tends to be younger (18–40 years old) and therefore very geographically mobile—can also be potentially challenging. Follow-up is by self-report questionnaire only at 6, 12 and 18 months and therefore not too onerous for patients. The internal pilot will check that such patients can be followed up consistently, and any innovative methods used to follow up a young mobile population are successful, i.e., web-based questionnaires, phone and text.</p>
