                  <p>Personalised Exercise-Rehabilitation FOR people with Multiple long-term conditions (PERFORM) is a research programme that seeks to develop and evaluate a comprehensive exercise-based rehabilitation intervention designed for people with multimorbidity, the presence of multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs). This paper describes the protocol for a randomised trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PERFORM intervention, study design and processes.</p>

                  <p>A multicentre, parallel two-group randomised trial with individual 2:1 allocation to the PERFORM exercise-based intervention plus usual care (intervention) or usual care alone (control). The primary outcome of this feasibility trial will be to assess whether prespecified progression criteria (recruitment, retention, intervention adherence) are met to progress to the full randomised trial. The trial will be conducted across three UK sites and 60 people with MLTCs, defined as two or more LTCs, with at least one having evidence of the beneficial effect of exercise. The PERFORM intervention comprises an 8-week (twice a week for 6 weeks and once a week for 2 weeks) supervised rehabilitation programme of personalised exercise training and self-management education delivered by trained healthcare professionals followed by two maintenance sessions. Trial participants will be recruited over a 4.5-month period, and outcomes assessed at baseline (prerandomisation) and 3 months postrandomisation and include health-related quality of life, psychological well-being, symptom burden, frailty, exercise capacity, physical activity, sleep, cognition and serious adverse events. A mixed-methods process evaluation will assess acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of intervention delivery and feasibility of trial processes. An economic evaluation will assess the feasibility of data collection and estimate the costs of the PERFORM intervention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) (or ‘multimorbidity’), defined as the presence of at least two long-term conditions (LTC) within an individual,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> are a major global public health problem. Over one in five adults are estimated to be living with MLTCs<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> and this is associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalisation, higher healthcare costs and functional decline resulting in reduced health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–7</xref> The 2021 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions shows there to be few or no evidence-based therapies to support the management of people living with MLTCs.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>In contrast, a substantial body of evidence has demonstrated improvements in functional capacity, health-related quality of life and reduced risk of hospital admissions following structured exercise-based rehabilitation for several different single LTCs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–15</xref> However, the current models of delivery of exercise-based rehabilitation across many international healthcare systems have important limitations for adults with MLTCs.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> First, current provision is dominated by rehabilitation services targeted at cardiovascular or pulmonary conditions. Second, these rehabilitation programmes are effectively single disease in their focus, and therefore, not formally designed to consider the more complex and wider health needs of people living with MLTCs. Consequently, while these rehabilitation health professionals may be specialists in cardiopulmonary disease, they are not necessarily all trained to manage the broader rehabilitation needs for other LTCs. As a result, the potential benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation are not currently available to many people with MLTCs.</p>
              <p>The Personalised Exercise-Rehabilitation FOR people with Multiple long-term conditions (PERFORM) is a research collaboration and programme funded by the National Institute of Health Research that seeks to develop and evaluate a comprehensive exercise-based rehabilitation intervention specifically designed for people with MLTCs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This paper describes the protocol for a trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PERFORM intervention, study design and processes.</p>

                <p>The intervention comprises an 8 week supervised group-based rehabilitation programme that will be offered in either a primary or secondary care setting. Sessions will be delivered twice a week for the first 6 weeks and once a week for the last 2 weeks (n=14). Each session will last for 2 hours (1 hour of supervised exercise and 1 hour of self-care support including discussion and self-care planning around a range of common issues for people with MLTCs). The intervention will be offered within 4 weeks of the initial assessment. Participants will also be offered group-based maintenance sessions at 4 months postrandomisation and 6 months postrandomisation (n=2). These sessions will provide an opportunity to review long-term progress, provide additional support to participants and address any further questions they may have after the 8-week supervised intervention period.</p>
                <p>Exercise training sessions will be individually prescribed and progressive, focusing on both increasing aerobic fitness and improving physical functioning. Training intensity will be set at &gt;70% of maximum, based on performance of the incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) as a measure of maximal capacity.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The programme will aim for bouts of 30 min of exercise, 5 days per week. Resistance training of the major muscle groups will be delivered based on ACSM guidance for older adults (3 sets of 10–12 exercises performed on at least 2 non-consecutive days per week).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 26</xref> Participants will also be asked to supplement supervised sessions with an individually tailored home exercise programme, which will be closely monitored, with the exercise prescription progressed as appropriate. The home exercise programme and self-care activities will be captured in a standardised ‘Progress Tracker’ diary that requires the participants to record exercise frequency, duration and effort scores, their overall goals for change and specify changes in self-care behaviours and identify any changes in self-care that impact on their physical and mental well-being.</p>
                <p>‘Health and Well-being’ self-care support sessions aim to support self-management of common symptoms and risk factors and to enhance self-management skills, including problem-solving, planning, self-monitoring and cognitive adaptation. The list of core sessions that will be delivered to participants randomised to the intervention arm (in no particular order) are detailed:</p>

The 3-month time point coincides with the end of the 8-week intervention delivery period for participants in the intervention arm and allows a 1-month period after the baseline visit for completion of randomisation and referral processes. The baseline assessment will be completed by a member of the research team and includes participant outcomes listed below plus participant demographics and medical history (age, gender, ethnicity, marital/civil partnership status, living situation, smoking status, employment status, education status, postcode, caring responsibility, medical history (including LTCs, height, weight, resting blood pressure/heart rate and respiratory frequency) and concomitant medicines. A blinded assessor, with no knowledge of treatment allocation, will collect outcomes at follow-up. Efforts to maximise participant retention include a trial newsletter sent to sites and payment to participants for data collection visits. We will attempt to collect follow-up data from all participants regardless of whether they discontinue or deviate from the intervention.</p>

                <title>Process evaluation</title>
                <p>The process evaluation will explore the feasibility and acceptability of both the intervention and the study design, and it will be conducted following the Medical Research Council guidelines for process evaluation of complex interventions.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> A key aim of the process evaluation will be to assess and refine the programme theory in preparation for a full trial. In addition, it will assess: (1) intervention elements, that is, acceptability, context, fidelity, exposure, reach and (2) study-related elements, that is, acceptability of trial methods including recruitment, outcome measures and contamination.</p>
                <p>Quantitative process data will include attendance at sessions and fidelity assessments. The fidelity assessment will be completed using randomly selected audiorecorded and videorecorded sessions and a fidelity checklist developed by the trial team, building on methods used in our prior intervention studies.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> We will assess up to 24 individual initial assessments and 24 follow-up phone calls (~8 per site). We will assess (by direct observation/researcher site visit) 9–12 of the group exercise sessions (3–4 visits per site), these will include a mixture of early, mid and late sessions per group. Finally, we will audiorecord all the postexercise self-care support sessions and assess a sample of 24–30 of these (8–10 per site), reflecting the full range of session topics. Two team members will rate these sessions and inter-rater reliability will be assessed using a simple percentage agreement score for each checklist item. We will also: (1) ask staff delivering the PERFORM intervention to report confirmation that intended content (ie, exercises, self-care topics, facilitation techniques) were taught, (2) ask therapists to report both clinic observations of adherence to exercise and their assessment of home exercises performed by patients unsupervised and (3) patient reports of exercise adherence (based on intervention participants completing a weekly Progress Tracker diary during the supervised first 8 weeks).<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
</p>
                <p>Qualitative process data will include semistructured telephone interviews with intervention participants (~30) and delivery staff (~12). Participants will be purposively sampled to include a range of conditions, gender, age, socioeconomic status and engagement with the intervention. We will also aim to interview those who did not attend the PERFORM intervention or those who were low attenders to inform improvements to the intervention. We will recruit from trial participants who will be asked to consent to be contacted about the interviews as part of the baseline assessment. They will then be contacted to see if they are willing to take part in the interviews, and if so, informed consent will be obtained (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix B</xref>). Two intervention staff and 2 referrers per site (12 in total) will be interviewed to inform recruitment for the main trial and identify any implementation issues.</p>

                <p>Interviews will take place after the 8 weeks PERFORM intervention supervised period is completed and will explore the acceptability of the recruitment process and outcome measures; acceptability of the intervention; impact of the intervention on behaviour; barriers and facilitators to engagement, staff training, suggestions for improvements as well as contextual factors influencing intervention impact. Interview schedules will be guided by the PERFORM programme theory and normalisation process theory (NPT),<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> an implementation theory that has been used extensively to explore the processes underpinning implementation, embedding and integration of service innovations.

All healthcare, personal social service resource, employment data and personal costs will be documented at the 4-month follow-up by completion of healthcare resource use questionnaires and collection of concomitant medication usage as reported by participants. The questionnaire will be tailored to the resource use requirements of people with MLTCs (and informed by resource use analysis conducted in work package 1 of the PERFORM research programme<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Incorporation of the full spectrum of outcomes beyond the quality-adjusted life-year/EQ-5D within a feasibility cost–consequences analysis framework will further provide initial insights to this pragmatic economic evaluation for a population with MLTCs. This feasibility economic evaluation component will also provide an opportunity to inform broader workforce impacts and other service configuration resources required to deliver the PERFORM intervention (eg, facilities, equipment) identified during the intervention development stage.</p>
