                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Remote monitoring of home physiological measurements has been proposed as a solution to support patients with chronic diseases as well as facilitating virtual consultations and pandemic preparedness for the future. Daily home spirometry and pulse oximetry have been demonstrated to be safe and acceptable to patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) but there is currently limited evidence to support its integration into clinical practice.</p>

                  <title>Aim</title>
                  <p>Our aim is to understand the clinical utility of frequent remote physiological measurements in ILD and the impact of integrating these into clinical practice from a patient, clinical and health economic perspective.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>132 patients with fibrotic ILD will be recruited and randomised to receive either usual care with remote digital monitoring of home spirometry and pulse oximetry or usual care alone for 12 months. All participants will complete health-related quality of life and experience questionnaires.</p>
                  <p>The primary outcome compares the availability of spirometry measurements within the 2 weeks preceding planned clinic appointments. Secondary outcomes will explore other aspects of clinical and cost-effectiveness of the remote monitoring programme.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is an umbrella term describing a spectrum of diseases of progressive scarring of the lungs causing progressive breathlessness.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In some cases, for example, in association with autoimmune disease, fibrosis develops following an inflammatory process in the lung parenchyma. In others, fibrosis develops without pre-existing inflammation. The most common form of ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which has a reported mean incidence of 0.12 cases/10000<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and is rising by up to 5% per year.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Treatment of ILD aims to reduce any inflammation to prevent development to fibrosis, reduce development of further fibrosis, reduce lung inflammation and treat symptoms.</p>
              <p>Current guidelines for the management of IPF<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> recommend that patients are reviewed by a respiratory specialist every 4â6 months with lung function testing beforehand to monitor progression of disease and response to their current therapeutic regime. There is no formal guidance for the monitoring of patients with other forms of ILD but in the UK most patients are seen approximately 6 monthly with lung function testing.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Lung function monitoring in ILD usually includes assessment of oxygen saturations, spirometry and gas transfer measurements.</p>
              <p>Remote monitoring of physiological measurements has been proposed as an additional approach to monitoring chronic diseases. Benefits of remote spirometry and oximetry for patients with ILD have been suggested to include earlier detection of deterioration<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> or acute illness and personalisation of care,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> reduced travel to hospitals,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> support of virtual consultations, and increased patient awareness and engagement in management of their lung disease which may support better psychological health.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10â12</xref>

              <p>Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with ILD are willing and able to measure their spirometry at home frequently<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13â17</xref> for up to 12 months.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> These studies have demonstrated that home handheld spirometry correlates well with lab-based spirometry,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> although home spirometry often underestimates values compared with lab-based spirometry. Currently, there is no evidence for optimal frequency of spirometry measurements in ILD and no guidelines for spirometry performed outside of a formal lung function laboratory.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A previous randomised controlled trial of remote spirometry uploaded to a bespoke platform via Bluetooth did not meet its primary endpoint of improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessed using the Kings Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire but did demonstrate improvements in the psychological domains in those with home monitoring compared with those who did not.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

              <p>Oxygen saturation is a key physiological measurement of severity of lung disease. Remote pulse oximetry was implemented extensively during the COVID-19 pandemic to manage patients in the community and reduce hospital admissions and appeared to be safe but of limited impact.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Preliminary studies by our group have shown that daily home pulse oximetry in patients with ILD for clinician review is feasible over a 3-month period with 83% of participants providing measurements on at least 70% of study days, and 72% of participants providing measurements at least three times/week.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</p>
              <p>There are limited data regarding the use of remote pulse oximetry for monitoring ILD. It has been demonstrated that short-term continuous oximetry could be used to determine the need for ambulatory oxygen therapy but the economic implications of this were not measured.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Previous studies show that patients with chronic lung diseases, including ILD, found knowing their oxygen saturations reassuring and helped guide their activity levels and oxygen consumption.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Furthermore, clinicians have identified pulse oximetry as the variable that they think would be most beneficial for home monitoring in ILD.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p>
              <p>Currently remote monitoring in ILD is not widely used in clinical practice.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Common barriers cited are organisational structure and lack of resources, as well as lack of evidence for efficiency and technical issues.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Other concerns raised about integrating new digital health systems include both data overload, but also that artificial intelligence may not be able to detect subtler nuances, such as missing data may represent periods of either good health or deterioration.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</p>
              <p>Our randomised controlled study aims to explore whether there is a difference in health and economic outcomes by comparing a cohort of patients who have been asked to monitor their pulse oximetry and spirometry with regular clinical review in addition to their usual clinical care compared with a cohort who are receiving usual clinical care alone.</p>

                <p>The study design is an unblinded randomised control study with parallel arms where participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either the remote monitoring arm or usual care arm.</p>
                <p>Following informed consent, baseline clinical data collected as part of usual clinical National Health Service (NHS) care will be used for the purpose of the study including previous medical history, all medication usage, previous lung function tests and radiology results. All participants will be asked to complete HRQoL questionnaires (modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, K-BILD Questionnaire, EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire) and Patient Activation Measure (PAM) at baseline.</p>
                <p>Participants will then be randomly allocated to either the remote monitoring arm or usual care arms.</p>
                <p>Remote monitoring arm:</p>
                <p>Participants who are allocated to the active remote monitoring arm will be provided with a portable handheld spirometer (Spirobank Smart, MIR, <ext-link xlink:href="www.spirometry.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.spirometry.com</ext-link>) and pulse oximeter (model 3230, Nonin; <ext-link xlink:href="www.nonin.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.nonin.com</ext-link>) linked to an electronic health application (patientMpower, <ext-link xlink:href="www.patientMpower.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.patientMpower.com</ext-link>). Participants will be trained to undertake remote spirometry and pulse oximetry and they will be asked to perform measurements three times per week including two spirometry blows and one resting pulse oximetry reading on each occasion. All readings will automatically be captured via the patientMpower electronic health application and will be immediately visible to their clinical care team via a secure web-based portal. All spirometry attempts will be analysed in real time using artificial intelligence software (ArtiQ, <ext-link xlink:href="www.artiq.eu" ext-link-type="uri">www.artiq.eu</ext-link>)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> to assess the quality of the spirometry according to European Respiratory Society (ERS)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> provided with real time feedback given to participants. Participants will be reminded to record their measurements once weekly.</p>
                <p>Participating centres will be asked to monitor these remotely recorded measurements at least every 2 weeks and at, or before, planned clinical assessments. They will be advised that should there be a sustained decrease in either spirometry or pulse oximetry further clinical assessment is recommended.</p>
                <p>Participants should continue to have all clinical appointments and medications as per their treating clinicianâs recommendations. If there is a clinical decision to discontinue remote monitoringâeither for safety/clinical reasons or due to patient choice this should be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).</p>
                <p>Usual care arm: These participants will have all clinical appointments and medications as per their treating cliniciansâ recommendations.</p>
                <p>All participants will be asked to complete health-related QoL questionnaires at 3 months (K-BILD, GAD-7), 6 months (K-BILD, GAD-7, EQ-5D-5L, PAM, modified MRC dyspnoea scale) and at 12 months which is the conclusion of the study.</p>
                <p>All clinical observations, appointments, investigations and conversations which occur over the course of the following year will be recorded in the eCRF and analysed.</p>

                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome will be measured by comparing the number of clinical appointments where recent spirometry is available for review between the remote monitoring and usual care arms. Recent spirometry is defined as within 2 weeks of the clinical appointment. This will be measured at the first and last clinical appointments in the observation period.</p>
                  <p>The study hypothesis is that participants who have remote monitoring are more likely to have spirometry available for review at their clinic appointments and that the availability of spirometry is therefore dependent on the method of its collection.</p>

                  <p>Previous studies have shown high rates of adherence to daily and weekly home spirometry. Median adherence to weekly spirometry in the INMARK study was 96%.</p>
                  <p>The power calculation estimated that a sample of 108 participants would be large enough to detect a standardised effect size of 0.30 (Cohenâs w) between the active arm and usual care with 80% power.

The primary endpoint will be assessed at the first and last outpatient clinical review in all patients who have â¥2 clinical reviews during the study observation period. The primary endpoint will be assessed by a Ï<sup>2</sup> test of independence.</p>
                  <p>All other endpoints will be summarised for descriptive statistical display.</p>
                  <p>The health economic analysis will be performed adopting the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. NHS healthcare resource utilisation will be assessed using the data from the study and using standard unit cost data (Personal Social Services Research Unit), staff cost time and NHS tariffs. Effectiveness will be measured in terms of differences in quality-adjusted life-years in the two arms, using a linear approximation method, assuming the change in the utility over time is linear. Costs and effectiveness in both arms will be compared and the results presented in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.</p>
