                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Anxiety, mood and trauma-related disorders are common, affecting up to 20% of adults. Many of these individuals will experience symptoms of more than one disorder as diagnostically defined. However, most psychological treatments focus on individual disorders and are less effective for those who experience comorbid disorders. The Healthy and Resilient Mind Programme: Building Blocks for Mental Wellbeing (HARMONIC) trial introduces a novel transdiagnostic intervention (<italic>Shaping Healthy Minds (SHM)</italic>), which synthesises several evidence-based treatment techniques to address the gap in effective interventions for people with complex and comorbid difficulties. This early phase trial aims to estimate the efficacy and feasibility of the transdiagnostic intervention in preparation for a later-phase randomised controlled trial, and to explore mechanisms of change.</p>

                  <title>Methods/analysis</title>
                  <p>We outline a patient-level two-arm randomised controlled trial (HARMONIC) that compares <italic>SHM</italic> to treatment-as-usual for individuals aged &gt;18 years (n=50) with comorbid mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive or trauma/stressor disorders diagnoses, recruited from outpatient psychological services within the UK National Health Service (NHS). The co-primary outcomes will be 3-month follow-up scores on self-report measures of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and disability and functional impairment. Secondary outcomes include changes in symptoms linked to individual disorders. We will assess the feasibility and acceptability of <italic>SHM</italic>, the utility of proposed outcome measures, and refine the treatment manuals in preparation for a later-phase trial.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>This trial protocol has been approved by the Health Research Authority of the NHS of the UK (East of England, Reference: 16/EE/0095). We anticipate that trial findings will inform future revisions of clinical guidelines for numerous forms of mood, anxiety and stressor-related disorders. Findings will be disseminated broadly via peer-reviewed empirical journal articles, conference presentations, clinical workshops and a trial website.</p>

            <p>Mood, stressor-related, obsessive-compulsive and anxiety disordersâ€”theÂ so-called common mental health problems (CMHP; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 2011)â€”are one of the largest causes of disability in the world, with 16%â€“20% of adults affected at any given time.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Maximising our ability to treat CMHP in cost-effective, efficient and effective ways that can be widely disseminated is a priority.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> At present, there is a range of complex psychological treatments with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of CMHP, and in preventing recurrence. Consequently, NICE recommends psychological treatment at various points in the care pathway to all those suffering from such problems, although there are not specific recommendations for individuals experiencing more than one problem.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Between 40% and 80% of patients experiencing a CMHP also experience an additional comorbid CMHP.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Even our best available psychological treatments only achieve clinical recovery for 40%â€“70% of patients, depending on their primary CMHP, with people suffering complex comorbid conditions faring significantly worse.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> For the majority of patients who receive treatment, there remains a significant risk of future relapse.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> A key challenge therefore is how we can build on and extend beyond the current psychological treatments for CMHP to increase efficacy, and sustained recovery, particularly for those with comorbid, recurrent and complex presentations.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, there has been a major shift in the conceptualisation of CMHP, away from a single-diagnosis approach in favour of a transdiagnostic model.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> There is strong empirical and theoretical support for development of transdiagnostic treatment approaches, as many of the cognitive, emotional, behavioural and interpersonal factors which drive symptomatology are consistent across disorders.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> A transdiagnostic approach thereby has the potential to improve the efficacy and efficiency of treatment for people with anxiety, stress and depression.</p>
            <p>There are potential limitations to the commonlyÂ used single-disorder-focused treatment approach. First, with the exception of a few existing programmes,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> most evidence-based treatment protocols are single-disorder-focused programmes (eg, depression,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> generalised anxiety,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> social anxiety<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and post-traumatic stress disorder<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Comorbid conditions and disorders are either ignored, or minimally treated within these treatment packages. This leaves a mismatch between the available evidence base and the clinical reality which clinicians face: the majority of people with any given CMHP have at least one or more comorbid disorders to their primary diagnosis.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Second, in the attempt to manualise treatments, most packages are inflexible â€˜one-size-fits-allâ€™ approaches, leaving patients with a wide range of problems and presentations receiving the same treatment package, regardless of their symptoms, goals and concerns.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Third, in practice, many clinicians already deliver evidence-based psychological treatments in a flexible manner in order to address individual concerns and goals. Manualised treatments need to better reflect the realities of serviceÂ user experiences and treatment delivery. This approach merits improvement so that delivered treatments are more efficient, effective and personalised to individualsâ€™ concerns.</p>
            <p>Existing psychological treatments for CMHP share more similarities than differences.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Despite differences in the theoretical foundation underlying available psychological treatments, and the terms used to describe maintaining factors and treatment targets, there are many common elements. For instance, psychoeducation, graded exposure, mindfulness techniques and behavioural activation form a key component of a variety of effective treatments such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapyÂ (CBT), CBT, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), exposure therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). The widespread availability of so many treatment options has the potential to elicit considerable decision-making difficulties for the treating clinician. In both formulation and treatment planning, challenging decisions occur when selecting the order in which to treat multiple difficulties, in evaluating the most appropriate treatment approach, and working out which treatment option will be acceptable and effective for the client.</p>
            <p>A recent equivalence randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that a transdiagnostic protocol (The <italic>Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders)</italic>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and single-disorder protocols produced statistically equivalent reduction in severity of principal anxiety disorder diagnosis, but that there was less attrition in the transdiagnostic group.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Promising results have also been found for other transdiagnostic treatment protocols, including Nortonâ€™s Transdiagnostic Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for anxiety,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Grosâ€™s Transdiagnostic Behaviour Therapy for affective disorders<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and Schmidtâ€™s False Safety Behaviour Elimination Therapy for anxiety disorders.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition, our systematic review and meta-analysis supported the overall efficacy of transdiagnostic treatments.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The review called for more high-quality studies to resolve uncertainties surrounding the heterogeneity of treatment effects and to determine the best treatment approaches and designs. We aim to address these issues through evaluating a novel intervention which combines a number of evidence-based treatment strategies. In using a modular approach, this trial will contribute to identification and evaluation of effective treatment components and delivery method. The modular approach to treatment design incorporates self-contained functional units (therapy modules) that can operate independently and be delivered flexibly, and refer to other modules if needed.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A complex, modular, tailored transdiagnostic intervention that targets common underlying processes maximises goodness of fit and has a direct focus on process rather than symptoms. The approach is thereby suitable for complexity and comorbidity as well as subsyndromal and prodromal symptoms.</p>
            <p>The transdiagnostic intervention we have developedâ€”Shaping Healthy Minds (<italic>SHM</italic>)<italic>â€”</italic>targets the processes and symptoms that are common to CMHPs and offers a number of advances in transdiagnostic treatment by incorporating the best available techniques from existing manual-based treatments into the one treatment package. A key aim of the programme is to encompass the treatment techniques that skilled psychologists and mental health clinicians already implement in standard practice for depressed, stressed and anxious patients with complex presentations.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The intervention also builds on the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment for Emotional Disorders described by Barlow <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> by working towards a prescriptive approach for the delivery of treatment modules based on the formulation of the clientâ€™s presenting difficulties.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Specifically, the treatment expands beyond interventions grounded in a sole treatment paradigm (eg, CBT) towards a theory-driven approach that usesÂ efficacious techniques translated from basic science alongside components drawn from a wide range of evidence-based psychological treatments (eg, mindfulness-based interventions, ACT, behavioural activation and DBT).</p>
            <p>The treatment protocol for <italic>SHM</italic> also changes the way that standardised manual-based treatments are delivered. Rather than using integral interventions (where all patients receive the same relatively fixed, complete protocol), the transdiagnostic intervention is a modular intervention, whereby the assessment of core problematic areas of emotional, cognitive, interpersonal and behavioural processes informs the selection and sequence of treatment modules targeted at specific problem areas for patients.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This modular approach allows for standardised, yet flexible treatment that is personalised to the individual concerns, problems and goals for the patient. Finally, it expands beyond interventions that typically focus on alleviating negative symptomatology (eg, negative thoughts, excessive negative emotions) and incorporates interventions designed to increase positive emotions, capture strengths and enhance resilience for sustained recovery.</p>
            <p>We aim to examine the feasibility of <italic>SHM</italic> in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, distress, disability and functional impairment through an earlyÂ stage RCT, in line with recommendations for the development of complex interventions.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In particular, we will gather data on the extent to which <italic>SHM</italic> performs comparably to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for a given serviceÂ userâ€™s primary diagnosed problem<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 28</xref> as well as for other significant additional, secondary and/or comorbid difficulties. In addition, this trial will provide a preliminary evaluation of whether a modular transdiagnostic treatment approach may be effective at reducing the distress and impairment associated with CMHP.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The trial will also provide an indication of the feasibility and acceptability of the transdiagnostic intervention to serviceÂ users and clinicians by recruiting through postprimary care UK National Health Service (NHS) psychology services where complex comorbidity represents the modal clinical presentation. In addition, the trial will provide initial estimates of cost-effectiveness in terms of serviceÂ use and potential quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)Â added. We therefore present the protocol for a feasibility trial with co-primary outcomes, examining the effect of <italic>SHM</italic> on primary and comorbid diagnoses. The feasibility trial will provide a plausible range of point estimates of the efficacy of <italic>SHM</italic> on standardised continuous symptom measures for primary and secondary diagnoses to inform this key question, refine the treatment manual and contribute to the design of future scaled-up trials.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>

                <p>The proposed feasibility study will seek to recruit 50 people aged 18 yearsÂ and above with a primary diagnosis of a unipolar mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, or trauma-related and stressor-related disorder (CMHPs) with at least one additional comorbid diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,Â Fifth Edition (DSM-5).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: (1) <italic>SHM</italic> orÂ (2) TAU. Diagnosis of CMHPs will be determined by trained research staff using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5).<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>Â To be eligible, participants will also need to scoreÂ &gt;10 on either the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) or the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; see study measures below). Exclusion criteria are current/past psychosis or bipolar disorder, current diagnosis of alcohol or substance use disorder (all assessed viaÂ SCID-5<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), organic brain damage, complex trauma history or recurrent self-injury requiring specialist services, or current suicidality that warrants immediate clinical attention and constitutes a current risk of harm to the individual (all assessed via participant report and the clinical care team). Participants may be engaged with the multidisciplinary clinical care team, but those randomised to <italic>SHM</italic> will not be receiving other psychological services while participating in the trial. All other services (eg, medication review with psychiatrist or general practitioner, occupational therapy, social support services) may be continued, and there are no medication exclusions.</p>
                <p>Participants will be recruited through local NHS clinical psychology services, including the high-intensity team of the Cambridge Psychological Wellbeing Service, and secondary care services with expertise in treatment of more complex and comorbid affective disorders. The recruitment pathways will involve suitable serviceÂ users on a waitlist to receive treatment being identified by a member of the clinical service (including an assistant psychologist focusing primarily on recruitment into clinical research studies) who will provide them with a letter outlining the study. ServiceÂ users will then be able to contact the research team to opt into the study. Initial eligibility will be screened over the telephone, and suitable participants will be invited to complete the SCID, either at the clinical service or the research unit. At the beginning of this session, all participants will provide written informed consent (see supplementary materials for a sample Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form,Â online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>). No potential participants will be contacted by a member of the research team until they have given consent for such contact to a member of the clinical care team.</p>

                <p><italic>SHM</italic> is a modular intervention, comprising 10 independent modules that will last up to 20 sessions. The content of the modules is drawn from a number of evidence-based psychological therapies, including CBT,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> ACT,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> DBT,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> MBCT<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and behavioural activation.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> The programme aims to bring together the core and unique therapeutic techniques from the best available disorder-focused treatment packages into the one transdiagnostic treatment package (eg, behavioural experiments<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and graded exposure<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> from CBT, value exercises and mindfulness strategies from ACT,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> activity scheduling from BA,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> emotion regulation strategies from DBT,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and presentÂ moment awareness exercises from MBCT).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The elements of <italic>SHM</italic> were drawn from recent meta-analyses supporting the effectiveness of these treatment strategies<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 41â€“43</xref>,Â and the manuals were written and reviewed by experienced clinical psychologists (TD, JMN, AB, CH and MB). In addition, experts in particular fields (eg, WK for mindfulness and case formulation) were consulted on the content of specific modules.</p>
                <p>The modular approach is standardised, yet can be flexibly delivered according to an individualâ€™s concerns, problems and goals.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The treatment focuses both on alleviating negative symptoms and enhancing positive well-being, by teaching skills and techniques and enhancing positive emotions, harness and build on strengths, and maximise resilience over the longerÂ term. Choice, order and length of modules (ie, number of sessions over which they are completed) areÂ tailored to the transdiagnostic difficulties of the individual using collaborative case formulation,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> although there are three core modules that everyone receives (outlined below). Treatment consists of weekly face-to-face 1â€‰hour sessions with the trial therapists. Sessions will involve collaboratively setting an agenda for the session based on the participantsâ€™ ratings for their top three problems and top three strengths, the goals set for therapy, and the module in focus. Participants will complete homework exercises to consolidate and practice the skills learnt during the specific modules and will be strongly encouraged to continue this practice following the end of one module and move to the next.</p>

The Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36),<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> a generic quality of life questionnaire, will measure overall health and well-being, daily functioning and general life satisfaction across multiple domains. These measures allow calculation of the additional number of quality of life years the treatment will yield.

                <p>Although a standard power calculation based on detecting treatment effects is the conventional approach to determining sample sizes for trials, the main aim of the current trial is to elucidate feasibility for a larger later-stage evaluation. We therefore sought at this stage only to provide a pointÂ estimate of the effect of <italic>SHM</italic> to inform a power calculation for this putative fully powered later-phase evaluation. Our previous experience with such early phase trial platforms indicates that 50 patients will provide sufficient numbers and diagnostic diversity to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and procedural uncertainty for <italic>SHM</italic> and a plausible test of recruitment protocols. This will give 40 patients (20 per arm) at 3-month post-treatment follow-up, assuming 20% attrition. This will provide a reasonable range of point estimates of effect on our set of candidate outcome measures sufficient to guide later phase trial work.</p>

                <p>The trial will take place at NHS sites and a research unit in the East of England. A Trial Management Group (TMG), will meet one to two times a year to: manage the protocol; monitor recruitment in relation to targets; deal with any adverse events; and coordinate the different stages of the project. The TMG consists of research clinical psychologists and assistant psychologists, a psychiatrist, a health economist, clinical psychology researchers, the trial statistician, a nurse practitioner and a service user representative. Day-to-day project management will be the responsibility of a smaller trial team, meeting fortnightly to deal with administrative issues, troubleshooting and recruitment flow. Clinical supervision will take place fortnightly. As this is a phase I/II trial, a dataÂ management committee was deemed unnecessary, and as such the trial team are responsible for monitoring and data management. Data will be monitored for completeness and consistency using spot checks and plausibility checks carried out by the trial statistician. The trial lead, trial coordinator and statistician will have full access to the final trial dataÂ set. The study data will be reported in line with the current CONSORT recommendations.</p>

                <p>Most broadly, the driving force behind the development of <italic>SHM</italic> has been feedback from many hundreds of service users in clinical settings, specifically related to the suitability of treatments for complex and comorbid CMHPs. A Lived Experience Group comprising service users and carers hosted by the Cambridge Centre for Affective Disorders discussed the details of the current study at its meeting on 12 November 2013. This group provided useful feedback to the research team in terms of the materials for serviceÂ users (eg, consent forms), the clinical setting for the intervention, and optimal forms of Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) involvement (specifically, the use of serviceÂ user researchers to conduct qualitative interviews with service users). Further, we received serviceÂ user input on the content of the draft treatment modules, and a part of this feasibility trial will be receiving feedback from participants on their experience of participating in the trial and using the manuals. We will send all participants a report describing the findings and their implications. We will also make participants aware of the study website. There will be a number of roles following completion of recruitment including the refinement and revision of the treatment manual along with involvement in the academic output preparation.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>A significant proportion of the cost of CMHPs is generated by adults suffering from complex and comorbid depression, stress and anxiety, where treatment non-response, cross-sector serviceÂ use across health, social care and housing, and loss of productivity are greatest. Providing effective interventions for these mental health problems therefore has the potential to reduce both long-term treatment costs as well as prevent large productivity losses. At present, most psychological interventions focus on specific diagnoses and many treatment manuals take a â€˜one-size-fits-allâ€™ approach. Current evidence-based interventions only achieve clinical recovery for 40%â€“70% of patients, with people suffering complex comorbid conditions faring significantly worse. This randomised controlled feasibility trial aims to pave the way for a scaled-up efficacy trial of a new transdiagnostic modular treatment for all CMHPsâ€”<italic>SHMâ€”</italic>that enables the flexible delivery of evidence-based techniques. This treatment approach may improve the effectiveness and dissemination of evidence-based interventions for the many individuals for whom diagnosis-specific treatments leave significant difficulties unaddressed. The results from this trial will provide a range of estimates of effect sizes that can be used to power a later-stage trial of treatment efficacy, to refine the treatment protocol and to inform future evaluation of the mechanisms underlying any treatment effects. If effective, <italic>SHM</italic> has the potential to improve outcome for those with complex presentations, through offering a cost-effective treatment option to reduce chronic, transdiagnostic psychological difficulties.</p>
