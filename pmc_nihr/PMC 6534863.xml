                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Dental caries in the expanding elderly, predominantly-dentate population is an emerging public health concern. Elderly individuals with heavily restored dentitions represent a clinical challenge and significant financial burden for healthcare systems, especially when their physical and cognitive abilities are in decline. Prescription of higher concentration fluoride toothpaste to prevent caries in older populations is expanding in the UK, significantly increasing costs for the National Health Services (NHS) but the effectiveness and cost benefit of this intervention are uncertain. The Reflect trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost benefit of General Dental Practitioner (GDP) prescribing of 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste and usual care compared to usual care alone in individuals 50 years and over with high-risk of caries.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">A pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial involving adults aged 50 years and above attending NHS dental practices identified by their dentist as having high risk of dental caries. Participants will be randomised to prescription of 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste (frequency, amount and duration decided by GDP) and usual care only. 1200 participants will be recruited from approximately 60 dental practices in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and followed up for 3 years. The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants receiving any dental treatment due to caries. Secondary outcomes will include coronal and root caries increments measured by independent, blinded examiners, patient reported quality of life measures, and economic outcomes; NHS and patient perspective costs, willingness to pay, net benefit (analysed over the trial follow-up period and modelled lifetime horizon). A parallel qualitative study will investigate GDPs’ practises of and beliefs about prescribing the toothpaste and patients’ beliefs and experiences of the toothpaste and perceived impacts on their oral health-related behaviours.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par85">The UK has an ageing population. The number of people of State Pension Age and over is projected to increase by 32.7% from 12.4 million in mid-2014, to 16.5 million by mid-2039. Likewise the number of people aged 75 and over is projected to rise by 89.3%, to 9.9 million, over the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Whilst an increase in life expectancy should be celebrated, attention needs to be given to the complex health needs, including oral health needs, of the growing population of older people.</p>
              <p id="Par86">Dental caries is preventable, yet it is the most common disease worldwide. In high-risk older populations it is an important public health issue, as the number of older people who retain their natural teeth is growing rapidly. In England in 2009, 6% of the adult population were edentulous, compared to 28% in 1978 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Dentate older adults tend to have extensively restored teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], mainly due to them having grown-up prior to the widespread use of fluoride toothpaste (introduced in the 1970’s). For these older adults, the risk of developing dental caries increases due to the presence of restorations and prostheses (bridges or dentures) that increase plaque retention, dry mouth (often as a result of polypharmacy), exposed root surfaces and a cariogenic diet. The oral health of these individuals will decline as their physical and cognitive abilities deteriorate, resulting in a growing population health problem with significant financial repercussions for the NHS; so prevention of caries is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par87">Recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recognised the impact poor oral health can have on older individuals’ ability to eat, speak and socialize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This guidance focused on those living in care homes (either nursing or residential), however, the majority of the 11 million adults in the UK, aged 65 years or over, live in their own homes, with less than 4% (approximately 414,000) living in some form of care home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is therefore important to establish a strong evidence base for the management of the oral health needs of older people across all residential settings. In the four countries of the UK dental policy on reforming NHS dental contracts places an emphasis on General Dental Practitioners (GDPs) providing effective caries prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and they have a central role in maintaining the oral health of the older population. The significant reductions in dental caries prevalence and severity over the last 40 years have primarily been attributed to fluoride toothpaste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. More recently high concentration, prescription-only fluoride toothpaste has been used increasingly in the management of patients with high risk of caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par88">The current evidence to support prescription of high concentration fluoride toothpaste (specifically 5000 ppm (ppm) toothpaste) to prevent caries is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A Cochrane review of different doses of fluoride toothpaste did not include any randomised controlled trials of 5000 ppm fluoride, however the review did find a dose-response relationship between the concentration of fluoride in toothpaste and caries prevention, with greater caries prevention for higher doses of fluoride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This review is currently being updated to include adults: no trials on the prevention of coronal caries through the use of 5000 ppm toothpaste have been identified. A more recent review of high fluoride concentration toothpastes included four studies (randomised and non-randomised) with 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. None of these studies meet the inclusion criteria for the Cochrane review and all have significant design and methodological limitations. However, despite the weak evidence base, GDPs in England are advised by national guidance published by Public Health England to prescribe high concentration 2800/5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste for older adults with active caries or those at risk of developing caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The prescription of this technology is expanding; in England in 2014 1.3 million items were prescribed at a cost of £17 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], a 12.2% increase from the previous year and similar increases are evident in Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We have little understanding of how this growing NHS investment benefits patients, or if it can play a useful role in tackling an emerging public health problem. There is a need for clear, evidence-based guidance on the prescribing of high concentration fluoride toothpaste in older adults for caries prevention.</p>

In addition, we will explore the attitudes of clinicians and patients to the prescribing and use of high fluoride toothpaste.</p>

                <p id="Par94">A two arm, parallel group, pragmatic, open label Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of GDP prescribed high concentration fluoride toothpaste and usual care compared to usual care alone in preventing and treating dental caries in older patients. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has ruled that the trial should be categorised as a Type A trial, as described in Risk proportionate approaches in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par95">A flow diagram for the trial is provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Follow up will last 3 years and will be conducted in multiple sites (approximately 60 General Dental Practices) located in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial Flow Diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2019_749_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par96">In parallel with the trial we will undertake a qualitative project to understand GDPs’ practises and beliefs about prescribing 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste and patients’ beliefs and experience of being prescribed 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste and perceived impacts on their oral health related behaviours. Furthermore, this element will also provide GDPs’ and patients’ feedback concerning recruitment to inform our recruitment strategy.

              <title>Ethical considerations</title>
              <p id="Par97">Favourable ethical opinion for the REFLECT study was confirmed by the North East - Newcastle &amp; North Tyneside 1 Research Ethics Committee on 17th November 2017 (REC reference number 17/NE/0329). The MHRA had no objection to the trial being classified as Type A under the notification scheme for risk-adapted Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products. The trial will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice provided by Research Governance Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Annual progress reports, notification of End of Trial, and a final report at the conclusion of the trial will be submitted to REC and to the MHRA within the timelines defined in the regulations. An independent Trial Steering Group supported by an independent Data Monitoring Group will oversee the conduct of the trial.</p>
              <p id="Par98">Participants are required to provide written informed consent to participate in the study, the consent form for the trial is included as Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Appendix 2. Potential participants will receive a letter of invitation and a trial information sheet detailing the process and procedures of the trial and the nature of the intervention to be tested. Dentists will take informed consent using an approved consent form within the practices and will verbally reiterate the information contained in the information sheet and answer any questions that patients may have about the trial as part of the informed consent process. All participants will be given a £25 gift voucher at the start of the trial and another £25 voucher at the end in acknowledgment of the time that participation in the trial will entail and to thank them for their support. Consent from participants for direct access to data will also be obtained. The patients’ confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations.</p>

              <title>Study participants</title>
              <p id="Par99">Participants will be identified in multiple sites (approximately 60 General Dental Practices) located in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Participants will be NHS dental patients, 50 years of age or older who are considered by their dentist to be at high risk of developing caries. Our decision to use the lower limit of 50 years of age was based on: in the UK high concentration fluoride toothpaste is currently being prescribed to individuals between 50 and 60 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; individuals 50 years and over have grown up in the absence of widespread use of fluoride toothpaste and consequently many individuals in this age group have heavily restored dentitions, increasing their caries risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey suggests that those individuals with complex dental needs are most prevalent in late middle age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Including a broad age range in the trial provides an opportunity to assess the impact of prescribing on different age groups in this older population.</p>
              <p id="Par100">High-risk individuals will be defined by: a diagnosis of active caries (into dentine) in the last 12 months which may/may not have been treated, or any root caries; and/or other risk factors as determined by their GDP.

              <title>Trial intervention</title>
              <p id="Par112">The trial intervention is prescription of 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste, used as prescribed by the participant’s GDP and informed by national guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The intervention is designed to reflect current dental practise and therefore the frequency of prescription, the number of tubes of toothpaste per prescription and the duration of the regimen will be determined by the patient’s GDPs after assessing each patient’s risk. We have restricted the intervention to 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste, as NHS prescribing data shows that 5000 ppm is more commonly prescribed than the 2800 ppm alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par114">Current guidance recommends that for those adults with obvious <italic>active</italic> coronal or root caries dentists should prescribe high fluoride toothpaste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our inclusion criteria are less restrictive to allow for prescription based not just on caries activity, but also based on other risk factors, as determined by the GDP. This approach is based on the hypothesis that 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste can prevent caries in those patients deemed to be high risk by their dentist, even though they don’t present with ‘obvious’ caries. For true primary prevention, the identification of risk factors in advance of disease is indicated.</p>
              <p id="Par115">The Investigational Medicinal Product (5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste) prescribed will not be specified by manufacturer or individual product. A clinical trials pharmacy will not be used to dispense the drug. The drug will be used as prescribed by the participant’s GDP and as indicated by the British National Formulary. Participants will be expected to collect their prescriptions at a local community pharmacy as per usual practice. GDPs will provide instructions to each participant based on their assessment of risk and how they prescribe the drug.</p>
              <p id="Par116">Compliance will depend on both GDPs’ and participants’ behaviour, the trial will not seek to ensure a minimal level of compliance. Compliance will be assessed to determine its impact on trial outcomes by recording GDPs’ self-reported prescribing behaviour frequency and duration of prescriptions and the number of tubes prescribed, accessing national datasets to identify if participants’ re-deem prescriptions or receive prescriptions from other sources and via participants’ (both test and control groups) self-reported use of toothpaste.</p>
              <p id="Par117">The comparator will be usual care; usually advice given by the participant’s GDP to buy ‘standard’, off-the-shelf 1350-1500 ppm fluoride toothpaste and use as advised by their dentist informed by national guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other recommendations in the national guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for self-administered (mouthwash) or professionally-applied (varnish) fluoride delivery methods could have an impact on the trial. We will take a pragmatic approach and leave the decision to use other fluoride delivery systems to the patients and their dentist, but the use of these interventions will be recorded.</p>

Eligible and consenting participants will be randomised to intervention and control groups using a web-based application, hosted by the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) CHaRT (Centre for Healthcare and Randomised Trials). The Principal Investigator (PI), or individual at site with delegated authority, will access the web-based system to randomise participants. The randomisation algorithm will use recruitment site, residential setting (own home/care home), exemption from dental treatment charges (yes/no) and age (50–65 years/over 65 years) as minimisation covariates to allocate treatment to intervention and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. A random element will be incorporated into the randomisation algorithm. Participants will be informed of their allocated treatment group following randomisation. The trial statistician and the study team will be blinded to the allocation during all analyses by use of a code to identify the two groups. The key to the code will be held by the CTU.</p>

              <title>Sample size considerations</title>
              <p id="Par147">The sample size calculation is based on a meaningful absolute target difference of 10% (75% vs 65%) in the primary outcome measure. This difference is considered to be both a realistic and important difference from discussion with dentists, PPI groups and from published estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The value for the comparator group (75% of individuals allocated to standard care who have restoration(s) or extraction(s) due to caries during the 36 months of follow up) is based on published data and Scottish treatment data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For the proposed target difference, a two-sided 5% significance level, and 90% power, 440 participants (880 in total) will be required to provide data for the primary outcome at 36 months. Based on our previous and current HTA trials, we are assuming 25% attrition, and so 587 participants per group are required (1174 in total) in approximately 60 practices (each practice recruiting an average of 20 participants). Based on an estimated consent rate of 50% [data from IQuad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]], 2348 eligible patients will be invited to participate.</p>
              <p id="Par148">An important secondary outcome within our proposed trial is caries increment, measured using the number of Decayed Missing and Filled tooth Surfaces (DMFS). Using the mean number of Decayed Missing and Filled tooth Surfaces (DMFS), the caries increments for an older population in the published literature vary, but there seems to be consensus around one surface per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Given the fact that the standard deviations approximate the means in terms of caries increment, a reduction in caries increment from 3 to 2 surfaces with the intervention would produce a ~ 30% reduction in caries increment with the intervention over 3 years. The numbers needed to adequately power this secondary outcome are relatively small compared with the primary outcome measure:</p>
              <p id="Par149">For secondary caries outcomes (Scotland only), group sample sizes of 200 and 200 achieve 97.5% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means when the population mean difference DMFS increment is μ1 - μ2 = 2–3 = − 1.0 with standard deviations of 2 for group 1 (intervention) and 3 for group 2 (control), and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample t-test allowing for unequal variances. Assuming 25% attrition, 267 participants per group are required (534) in total in 28 practices. Based on an estimated consent rate of 50% 1068 eligible patients will be invited to participate.</p>

In addition, mean NHS treatment costs in the 12 months prior to recruitment will be included in the baseline characteristics tables. Frequency counts and percentages will be used to present categorical data. Number of patients, mean, mode, median, SD, minimum, maximum and IQR will be used, as appropriate, to present continuous data.</p>

Secondary outcomes will be analysed using generalised linear models with adjustment for minimisation and baseline variables when available. Statistical significance will be at the 2-sided 5% level with corresponding confidence intervals derived. Subgroup analyses on the primary outcome will explore the possible modification of treatment effect by clinically important factors; gender, age and NHS dental charges exemption status. This will be done by including treatment-by-factor interactions in the model and they will be classified as exploratory analyses. All analyses will initially be performed on an intention to treat basis, although we will consider additional analysis groups such as per-protocol for investigation of adverse events.</p>
              <p id="Par153">Outcome data will not be imputed for the primary analysis, but score data for participants who have not returned a scheduled questionnaire will be estimated using a multiple imputation approach to make use of partial outcome data.

                <p id="Par162">Whilst health based outcomes are of importance for funders of dental care, there is a growing interest in wider measures of value, which go beyond traditional QALY approaches and offer a more holistic and sensitive measure of value. It is crucially important for adherence, and hence real-world cost-effectiveness, that any public health intervention is not only valued in terms of health outcomes within a clinical trial, but also has wider generalisability to the consumers of the intervention. We will therefore conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) reporting benefits in terms of WTP to obtain a more holistic measure of value. WTP will be obtained from a discrete choice experiment (DCE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], conducted with a nationally representative sample of the general population (aged 50 and over), to explicitly value the provision of high fluoride toothpaste, together with a range of plausible outcomes from the trial (e.g. avoidance of caries progression). The DCE will explicitly value the high fluoride toothpaste intervention, together with associated health outcomes and other important attributes.</p>
                <p id="Par163">The DCE will include a cost attribute. By including this attribute, the willingness to pay (WTP) for a change in the level of any other attribute will be estimated. Estimates of WTP derived from the DCE will be combined with the intervention (provided or not) and clinical outcome data from the trial to report net benefit [mean WTP – mean cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]] for high fluoride toothpaste compared to standard care. If benefits are greater than the costs, then high fluoride toothpaste would be deemed an efficient use of resources.</p>
                <p id="Par164">Results will be presented on a cost-benefit plane, illustrating the probability that the intervention is associated with positive or negative net benefit. A comprehensive set of sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to explore uncertainty in our conclusions. These will include assumptions surrounding missing data, the estimation of costs and the effect of different payment / co-payment structures on the cost-benefit results.</p>

                <title>Decision modelling</title>
                <p id="Par165">The “within trial” economic analyses will assess and report on the costs and outcomes of high fluoride vs. standard treatment up to 3 years post-randomisation. However, the true economic value of an intervention depends on the long-term implications of that intervention. We will develop a de novo Markov decision analysis model, to extrapolate the trial outcomes over a longer, life-time horizon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Results will be reported using a cost-effectiveness framework and estimates of WTP from the DCE will be used to explore results using a similar cost-benefit framework to that used for the primary trial based economic analysis. The final model structure and health state definition (e.g. caries progression, new caries, and tooth loss) will be developed in conjunction with dental experts. National cohort datasets, such as the adult dental health survey, and other longitudinal studies will be used as a source of baseline transition probabilities. Sensitivity analysis will use the data from the control (standard care) arm of the trial. Where possible, survival analysis methods will be used to assess the time to transition between health states in each of the study arms, with survival curves fitted over an extended time frame (patient’s life time). Data from cohort studies and literature reviews will be used where necessary to supplement extrapolation models to determine long run caries progression.</p>
                <p id="Par166">Cost data for health states beyond trial follow up will be sourced from the trial data and routine data sources (ISD/BSA/BSO) for appropriate treatment in the respective model health states. To inform a life-time cost-benefit analysis, estimates of WTP will be sourced directly from the DCE conducted alongside the trial for specific health states (e.g. WTP to avoid caries progression, new caries or tooth loss). The model will be developed at an early stage in the study to ensure all relevant data to populate the model are collected within the trial. All modelling assumptions will be extensively tested using sensitivity analyses and the model will be fully probabilistic. Key gaps in the evidence base will be identified and their potential impact on cost-effectiveness explored. Results will be presented using standard economic evaluation approaches to illustrate uncertainty. Threshold analyses will be conducted to indicate the values required for key model parameters to change economic evaluation results. Patients will be consented to obtain longer-term data linkage to routine records, which can then be used for future validation of the extrapolation assumptions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par181">The Reflect Trial is an NIHR HTA funded trial that is being undertaken across England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. It is a pragmatic, multi-centre, open-label randomised trial designed to determine whether or not the substantial and rapidly increasing costs of prescribing high fluoride concentration toothpaste benefits patients and represents a wise investment for the UK National Health Service. The trial is pragmatic in nature, designed as far as possible to mirror ‘real life’. This pragmatic approach is reflected in:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par182">the population: involved in the trial, high caries risk older adults, have been identified by national guidance in England as a key target group for prescribing high concentration fluoride toothpaste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par183">the intervention: prescription of high concentration fluoride toothpaste. 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste was chosen, as this higher concentration is likely to produce the largest effect size (compared to 2800 ppm fluoride toothpaste). The intervention tests the prescription of the drug by GDPs rather than the drug being directly provided to participants. Therefore decisions taken by dentists on the amount and frequency of prescribing the drug and the compliance of participants in using the toothpaste need to be measured and considered in the analysis and interpretation of results.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par184">the primary outcome measure: receipt of treatment as a result of caries was determined by patient and public involvement as a key concern of patients. More traditional measures of caries are included as secondary outcome measures</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par185">the comparator: the intervention will be compared to ‘usual practice’ as determined by each participant’s dentist.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par186">Importantly the setting for the trial is primary care dental practices, where the overwhelming majority of patients receive their dental care. Participants will be recruited in approximately 60 practices across the three countries, providing a varied range of practices operating in different geographical environments and socio-economics circumstances and different remuneration systems. This broad range of practices should ensure the results of this trial are widely applicable. The evidence base for high concentration fluoride toothpaste is not strong both in terms of both efficacy and for how well this health technology works in day-to-day general dental practice. The results of this pragmatic trial should complement the findings of efficacy trials to provide high quality evidence on the costs and benefits of high concentration fluoride toothpaste to support the decisions of dental practitioners, patients and policy makers on its use.</p>
              <p id="Par187">The team responsible for the design and delivery of the trial is multidisciplinary drawn from a strong collaboration between the Universities of Aberdeen, Dundee and Manchester plus colleagues working in the NHS and local research networks. The trial is a Clinical Trial of a Investigative Medicinal Product and is overseen by the trial sponsor Manchester University Foundation Trust, supported by an independent Trial Steering Group and Data Management Committee and Patient and Public Involvement Group. This will ensure that the trial is conducted to the highest standards. We expect the Reflect Trial to make an important national and international contribution to understanding the role that high concentration fluoride toothpaste can play in the management of high caries risk in older adults attending primary dental care.</p>
