                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Cardiothoracic surgical outcomes are poorer in people with diabetes compared with those without diabetes. There are two important uncertainties in the management of people with diabetes undergoing major surgery: (1) how to improve diabetes management in the weeks leading up to an elective procedure and (2) whether that improved management leads to better postoperative outcomes. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of delivering the Optimising Cardiac Surgery ouTcOmes in People with diabeteS (OCTOPuS) intervention, an outpatient intervention delivered by diabetes healthcare professionals for people with suboptimally managed diabetes over 8â€“12 weeks before elective cardiac surgery. The present study will assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in cardiothoracic centres across the UK.</p>

                  <p>A multicentre, parallel group, single-blinded 1:1 individually randomised trial comparing time from surgery until clinically fit for discharge in adults with suboptimally managed type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes undergoing elective surgery between the OCTOPuS intervention and usual care (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints will include actual time from surgery to discharge from hospital; days alive and either out of hospital or judged as clinically fit for discharge; mortality; time on intensive therapy unit (ITU)/ventilator; infections; acute myocardial infarction; change in weight; effect on postoperative renal function and incidence of acute kidney injury; change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>; frequency and severity of self-reported hypoglycaemia; operations permanently cancelled for suboptimal glycaemic levels; cost-effectiveness; psychosocial questionnaires. The target sample size will be 426 recruited across approximately 15 sites. The primary analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat population. A two-sided p value of 0.05 or less will be used to declare statistical significance for all analyses and results will be presented with 95% CIs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is increased approximately twofold in people with diabetes after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It affects approximately a third of all people with type 2 diabetes and contributes to over 50% of deaths.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As coronary heart disease in people with diabetes tends to be more diffuse affecting multiple vessels, coronary artery bypass grafting is often the preferred method for revascularisation. Approximately 30%â€“40% of all people undergoing open cardiac surgery have diabetes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Surgical outcomes are worse in people with diabetes, with an up to threefold higher risk of postoperative complications which include poor healing, wound complications and renal dysfunction.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> These complications are associated with longer hospital stay and higher readmission rates. The reasons underlying the poorer outcomes include hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and obesity. Although national and international groups have published detailed guidelines to improve surgical outcomes in people with diabetes, many people with diabetes are poorly prepared for surgery.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6â€“8</xref> In the European Multicenter Study on Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (E-CABG) study, 54% of people with type 2 diabetes treated with non-insulin medications and 67% of those with insulin-treated diabetes had an HbA<sub>1c</sub>â€¯aboveâ€¯53â€‰mmol/mol (7.0%) prior to cardiac surgery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
              <p>There are two important uncertainties in the management of people with suboptimally managed diabetes undergoing major surgery: (1) how to improve diabetes management in the weeks leading to elective surgery and (2) whether that improved management is reflected in better surgical outcomes. To address these gaps, the overarching aim of the Optimising Cardiac Surgery ouTcOmes in People with diabeteS (OCTOPuS) project is to develop and test whether a preoperative outpatient intervention to improve diabetes management improves cardiac surgical outcomes.</p>
              <p>The development of the intervention is described in detail elsewhere (Holt <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Under review). In summary, the prototype OCTOPuS intervention was based on a nurse-led outpatient intervention that has been used in Royal Bournemouth Hospital for 7 years and incorporated the findings of two rapid literature reviews. A feasibility study conducted in 17 people with diabetes undergoing cardiothoracic surgery at the University Hospital Southampton showed that it is possible to develop a clinical pathway to deliver the OCTOPuS intervention to improve glycaemic management prior to admission that was acceptable for people with diabetes and clinicians.</p>
              <p>The present study will be a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) in cardiothoracic centres across the UK to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>OCTOPuS is a multicentre, parallel group, single blind, individually randomised controlled trial incorporating a preplanned futility analysis. It will compare time from surgery until an individual is clinically fit for discharge in adults with suboptimally managed type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes undergoing elective cardiothoracic surgery between the OCTOPuS intervention and usual care. The provisional planned trial recruitment dates are 1 September 2021â€“31 August 2023. These are contingent on the reopening of elective cardiothoracic surgery and research capacity following the latest national COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

Before the outpatient appointment, a researcher will contact the prospective participant to discuss the study at least 24 hours before the appointment allowing time for reflection and discussion. This will permit eligible individuals to be randomised immediately after the outpatient appointment, and where possible receive their first OCTOPuS consultation, on the same day. The treating surgeon will remind eligible patients about the trial if a decision to proceed to surgery is made. If the person wishes to participate, he or she will have the opportunity to discuss the study face-to-face with a research nurse before they give written consent. Final eligibility criteria will be checked prior to recruitment. Patients whose medical records cannot be accessed prior to the appointment to determine eligibility (eg, patients from another hospital) will be given information about the study on the day of the appointment and will be offered the opportunity to attend another day to discuss participation.</p>

                  <p>To demonstrate that a physiological response is plausible, we need to show an HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction of 5â€‰mmol/mol in the intervention group presurgery compared with baseline. Previous experience shows the mean initial HbA<sub>1c</sub> in our study population is approximately 72â€‰mmol/mol, with a SD of 15â€‰mmol/mol.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> For an expected change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline of 5â€‰mmol/mol in the intervention group, and assuming a correlation of 50% between baseline and presurgery, a sample size in the intervention group of 50 participants would allow a margin of error of 4.16 below the mean for a 95% CI and would, therefore, allow us to exclude a difference of zero if the treatment difference of 5 was observed.</p>

                  <p>The primary outcome is the time from surgery to when the responsible consultant considers the participant clinically fit for discharge. We will not consider the actual discharge date in the primary analysis, as currently many elective cardiothoracic surgical patients remain in hospital longer than clinically indicated due to their social situation. Discussions with clinicians and commissioners suggest that a mean improvement of half a day would be clinically worthwhile.</p>
                  <p>The current mean duration postsurgery until clinically fit for discharge is 7â€‰days, with an SD of 1.5â€‰days. To demonstrate an improvement of 0.5â€‰days with 90% power and 5% significance with 1:1 randomisation between intervention and control arms would require a total of 382 participants (nQuery V.7.0). We will allow for a 5% loss to follow-up, and 5% for deaths post randomisation inflating the final target sample size to 426 participants. Participants will be recruited across approximately 15 UK cardiothoracic centres.</p>

                  <p>It is believed that the OCTOPuS intervention will have its clinically relevant effects through improvement of clinical measures, including change in body weight, exercise, lipid profile and blood pressure. However, the main target of the intervention is to improve glycaemic management; if no physiological effect can be demonstrated on glycaemic measures, continuation of the trial would be considered futile. After the first 100 participants have had their surgery, we will assess the effect of the intervention on preoperative HbA<sub>1c</sub>. If there is no discernible effect (defined as a change of HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &lt;5â€‰mmol/mol), we will ask the trial steering committee to review the trialâ€™s viability.</p>

                <p>Baseline participant demographics and characteristics will be summarised between the two arms.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The primary analysis will be conducted using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for randomisation stratification factors on an intention-to-treat population. Continuous data will be presented as means and SD and analysed using ANCOVA (or presented as medians and ranges and analysed using Mann-Whitney U tests if data are skewed). Binary data will be reported in terms of ORs and analysed using logistic regression modelling. Analysis of time-to-event outcomes will include presenting Kaplan-Meier graphs by arm and analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression (or competing risk regression as discussed below). A two-sided p value of 0.05 or less will be used to declare statistical significance for all analyses and results will be presented with 95% CIs. Subgroups will be investigated, including those with HbA<sub>1c</sub> above or below 69â€‰mmol/mol at presentation, type of diabetes, age above or below 75 years. The cut-off of 69â€‰mmol/mol has been chosen as the level above which the Joint British Diabetes Societies recommend specific action to improve preoperative glycaemic management. The cut-off for age has been chosen to reflect the different HbA<sub>1c</sub> entry criteria for those above and below 75 years.</p>
                <p>It is possible that a small proportion of participants will receive the intervention/usual care but will not actually undergo the planned surgery due to death, or clinically directed surgery cancellation. A small proportion may also undergo urgent revascularisation due to myocardial infarction after they have received their allocated treatment. A further group may undergo surgery but die before they are fit for discharge and thus not meet the primary endpoint. It is expected that these events will occur in fewer than 5% of participants. These individuals will be excluded from the primary analysis but the prevalence of each of these outcomes will be monitored and recorded by treatment arm separately to assess if there is an excess of any of these outcomes in either group. A sensitivity analysis will be considered, looking at a competing risks model, where these outcomes and functional recovery are competing risks. This sensitivity analysis will also be performed if the total prevalence of these events exceeds 5%.</p>

                <p>Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be estimated from EQ-5D-5L and mortality data using the area-under-the-curve method. Similarly, costs will be estimated at the patient level. Mean between-group differences in QALYs and costs will be estimated using a regression-based approach, including adjustment for baseline covariates and interaction terms for predefined subgroups, and allowing for clustering at hospital and/or practitioner level. Results will be presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) if appropriate. Non-parametric bootstrapping will be used to estimate CIs around estimated cost differences and ICERs.</p>
                <p>A simple modelling approach will also be used to estimate the costs and health impacts of surgical complications over a lifetime horizon. This extrapolation is necessary to reflect any mortality or lasting quality of life decrement associated with surgical complications. There will be no attempt to estimate the long-term impact of improved diabetes management related to the intervention, as it will be difficult to predict the duration over which any improvements will be maintained. This is likely to be a conservative assumption that will underestimate the QALY gain and cost-effectiveness of intervention if it proves effective. Model parameters will be estimated from the trial and from other published sources. Long-term resource use, mortality and utility decrements associated with key surgical complications will be identified by systematic review of HTAs, NICE guidelines and published literature.</p>
