                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) is common and often distressing. Most guidelines recommend amitriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin as initial analgesic treatment for DPNP, but there is little comparative evidence on which one is best or whether they should be combined. We aimed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of different combinations of first-line drugs for treatment of DPNP.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>OPTION-DM was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, crossover trial in patients with DPNP with mean daily pain numerical rating scale (NRS) of 4 or higher (scale is 0–10) from 13 UK centres. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1), with a predetermined randomisation schedule stratified by site using permuted blocks of size six or 12, to receive one of six ordered sequences of the three treatment pathways: amitriptyline supplemented with pregabalin (A-P), pregabalin supplemented with amitriptyline (P-A), and duloxetine supplemented with pregabalin (D-P), each pathway lasting 16 weeks. Monotherapy was given for 6 weeks and was supplemented with the combination medication if there was suboptimal pain relief (NRS &gt;3), reflecting current clinical practice. Both treatments were titrated towards maximum tolerated dose (75 mg per day for amitriptyline, 120 mg per day for duloxetine, and 600 mg per day for pregabalin). The primary outcome was the difference in 7-day average daily pain during the final week of each pathway. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN17545443.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Nov 14, 2017, and July 29, 2019, 252 patients were screened, 140 patients were randomly assigned, and 130 started a treatment pathway (with 84 completing at least two pathways) and were analysed for the primary outcome. The 7-day average NRS scores at week 16 decreased from a mean 6·6 (SD 1·5) at baseline to 3·3 (1·8) at week 16 in all three pathways. The mean difference was –0·1 (98·3% CI –0·5 to 0·3) for D-P versus A-P, –0·1 (–0·5 to 0·3) for P-A versus A-P, and 0·0 (–0·4 to 0·4) for P-A versus D-P, and thus not significant. Mean NRS reduction in patients on combination therapy was greater than in those who remained on monotherapy (1·0 [SD 1·3] <italic>vs</italic> 0·2 [1·5]). Adverse events were predictable for the monotherapies: we observed a significant increase in dizziness in the P-A pathway, nausea in the D-P pathway, and dry mouth in the A-P pathway.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>To our knowledge, this was the largest and longest ever, head-to-head, crossover neuropathic pain trial. We showed that all three treatment pathways and monotherapies had similar analgesic efficacy. Combination treatment was well tolerated and led to improved pain relief in patients with suboptimal pain control with a monotherapy.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) published a practice guideline on oral and topical treatments of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). The panel searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> databases from Jan 1, 2008, to April 30, 2020, for relevant peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials applying a careful analytical process to identify only class 1 and 2 studies. On July 12, 2022, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar with the key words “painful diabetic neuropathy” and identified two comparator randomised controlled trials published since April, 2020. Both trials were underpowered and used subtherapeutic doses of first-line drugs. The AAN report identified gaps in current knowledge including the following: few studies alone have investigated the effect of interventions on quality of life, patient functioning, mood, or sleep; there are few comparator studies of first-line drugs and their combinations; and scarce data is available on which patients respond to a specific intervention. The additional studies we identified did not address these limitations.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">Our large, multi-period crossover study compared the efficacy of three of the most prescribed first-line drugs for DPNP and their combinations not only for the primary outcome of pain relief, but also for important secondary outcomes including quality of life, mood, and sleep. We showed that all three treatment pathways and monotherapies had similar analgesic efficacy.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">To our knowledge, this was the largest and longest ever, head-to-head, multi-period crossover neuropathic pain trial. Our study can have an impact on future treatment guidelines, not only for DPNP, but also for chronic neuropathic pain treatment in general (estimated to affect 8–9% of the UK population) because current treatment guidelines are largely generic (eg, National Institute for Clinical Excellence's CG173). Our study can also benefit general practitioners, diabetes specialists, pain specialists, neurologists, general physicians, other medical and allied health-care professionals managing DPNP, and patients by the provision of improved treatment pathways. Some of the first-line drugs might not be available in resource-limited countries due to cost and other reasons, but our study can give confidence that any of these drugs or drug combinations, if titrated carefully to maximum tolerated doses, can result in similar levels of pain relief.</p>
                </boxed-text>
              </p>
              <p id="para90">Most international guidelines recommend amitriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin as first-line agents for symptomatic analgesic therapy in patients with DPNP. Robust evidence exists for the efficacy of each drug based on Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses, but the best outcome for any monotherapy is 50% pain relief in fewer than half of patients, which is often accompanied by dose-limiting side-effects.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The management of DPNP is hampered by the absence of robust, head-to-head evidence regarding which first-line agent to use first and which alternative agent to add in combination, when pain relief on monotherapy is suboptimal.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The COMBO-DN study showed that the standard dose combination treatment of duloxetine and pregabalin had equivalent efficacy to maximum dose monotherapy of either drug.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Moreover, combinations of tricyclic antidepressants and a gabapentinoid were found to be more efficacious than monotherapy.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, these studies were small and had short treatment periods.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As a result, most current guidelines do not recommend combination treatment due to insufficient evidence<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> despite widespread use by clinicians. The absence of evidence-based treatment pathways results in increased patient suffering and health-care costs.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Therefore, this context presents a good rationale for seeking robust evidence from well designed, head-to-head comparator trials of treatment pathways (first-line drugs and their combinations). Hence, the aim of the OPTION-DM trial was to determine the most clinically beneficial and best tolerated treatment pathway for patients with DPNP.</p>

Allocation concealment was achieved with site staff using the Sheffield Clinical Trials Research Unit's online randomisation system, which registered participant details before revealing allocation. The trial statistician created a predetermined randomisation schedule stratified by site using permuted blocks of size six or 12. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive one of six sequences over 50 weeks, comprising the three treatment pathways: A-P followed by D-P followed by P-A, A-P followed by P-A followed by D-P, D-P followed by A-P followed by P-A, D-P followed by P-A followed by A-P, P-A followed by D-P followed by A-P, and P-A followed by A-P followed by D-P. Masking of trial medication was maintained with identical over-encapsulated drugs and matching double-dummy placebo. The treating physician was masked to the treatment pathway but not the dose level. Those assessing outcomes and analysing data were also masked to the treatment pathways.</p>

During the first treatment phase, participants received monotherapy for 6 weeks. At the week 6 follow-up visit, on the basis of a 7-day average daily pain NRS score, those achieving mild pain (ie, NRS &lt;3) were classed as responders, and those with NRS score higher than 3 were classed as non-responders.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Responders continued monotherapy alone, reflecting clinical practice, whereas non-responders started the second drug in combination for an additional 10 weeks. Monotherapy and combination treatment doses were escalated towards the maximum tolerated dose or the target NRS of 3 or lower for satisfactory pain relief, whichever was reached first (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>).

                <p id="para180">The trial was initially powered on a mean difference between treatment pathways of 0·5 points on the NRS scale, on the basis of the effect size previously reported for comparison of two active interventions in a four-arm neuropathic pain crossover trial.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Assuming a within-patient SD of 1·65, α=0·0167 to allow for three comparisons, 90% power, and 25% dropout, 392 participants would be required. However, recruitment and retention for this year-long demanding trial, with multiple study visits and four washout periods became challenging (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and difficult to justify given that most previous similar trials<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> had used a 1 NRS point difference, which is half of a clinically important amount of pain reduction.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> With the approval of the Trial Steering Committee, our Patient and Public Involvement panel, and the funder, a decision was made to continue the trial until an adequate sample size was achieved to detect a difference of at least 1 NRS point between treatment pathways.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Using the original assumptions, 74 evaluable participants would provide 90% power to detect a difference of 1 NRS point and were sufficient to estimate differences in average pain to within an SE of 0·25 NRS points.</p>
                <p id="para190">For the statistical analysis, we used a modified intention-to-treat approach, which included all eligible participants who started each treatment pathway. We analysed the primary outcome and other continuous outcomes using a linear mixed model, with treatment group, period, and the interaction between the two as fixed effects and participant as a normally distributed random intercept. If the interaction (ie, the carrying over of the treatment to the next treatment period) effect was not significant, then it was removed, and a reduced model was fitted. Residuals were plotted against treatment, pathway, and fitted values, whereas random effects were visualised in a dotplot. We used linear contrasts to evaluate differences between treatment groups. We compared the percentage of participants reporting adverse events using a global χ<sup>2</sup> test across treatment groups, derived from a mixed effects logistic regression, with covariates being treatment group and period. Preplanned subgroup analyses according to baseline characteristics (age, sex, anxiety or depression, self-reported pain, and COVID-19 restrictions) were done descriptively by either Forest or Lowess plots and quantitatively by adding an interaction term in the statistical model; additional pre-planned analyses examined the change from baseline in pain among patients starting combination therapy compared with those who remained on monotherapy. Week-16 pain was the average pain between 106 and 112 days after the start of the treatment pathway or as close to this as possible within a window of –3 to +1 weeks, providing that this did not extend into the washout period and that scores were available for at least 4 of 7 consecutive days. Week-6 pain was scored analogously within a window of –2 to +1 weeks. Additionally, we assessed the effect of missing outcome data for the primary endpoint using multiple imputation, controlled multiple imputation,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and last observation carried forward (LOCF). Multiple imputation incorporated NRS data from all 16 weeks and used predictive mean matching with ten nearest neighbours with age, sex, baseline NPSI, treatment, and period as covariates (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>). Controlled imputation used the values of delta between 0 (equivalent to missing at random) to +2·5 NRS units for participants who discontinued treatment due to toxicity or poor response. We assessed convergence using trace plots. As three pairwise comparisons were done, all statistical tests were two-tailed at 1·67% significance level, and 98·33% CIs were used for the difference between treatment pathways. Analyses were done with Stata, version 16.1. This trial was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN17545443, and EUDRACT, 2016–003146–89.</p>

              <p id="para260">Overall, we observed few pairwise differences in any of the questionnaire outcomes. The D-P pathway had lower scores for role limitation due to physical health than both P-A and A-P at week 6 but not at week 16, and higher insomnia (measured by the ISI score) than A-P at both week 6 and 16. However, these should be treated with caution given the number of secondary outcomes assessed. The PGIC questionnaire, completed at the end of each treatment pathway, showed that similar proportions of participants reported feeling “much improved” or “very much improved” (44% for A-P, 43% for D-P, and 49% for P-A, p=0·70).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para290">The OPTION-DM trial showed that all three treatment pathways (A-P, D-P, and P-A) provided similar and significant pain reduction of 3·3 in NRS, or half the baseline pain intensity score. We found no statistically or clinically significant differences between the treatment pathways. To our knowledge, this was the first randomised, double-blind, comparator trial of neuropathic pain treatment pathways. Although head-to-head trials of individual monotherapies and combination treatments from the start could be designed, we felt that data on treatment pathways as a whole was most efficient and applicable to current clinical practice. This is because most patients are started on a monotherapy and will require a second agent added in combination within a few months. Therefore, OPTION-DM is a pragmatic trial, mirroring current neuropathic pain management pathways, allowing the outcomes of this study to be readily generalisable.</p>
              <p id="para300">To our knowledge, OPTION-DM is the longest blinded neuropathic pain trial to date,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> with each patient undergoing all three treatment pathways over 50 weeks. Unlike previous combination-treatment crossover trials,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> the durations of monotherapy and combination treatments were sufficiently long to assess the full treatment effects, even though this resulted in higher-than-expected dropouts (84 completed at least two pathways) mainly for personal and other non-treatment-related reasons (73%). Moreover, previous combination trials used fixed-dose titration regimens regardless of treatment response,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> which does not reflect clinical practice, and resulted in higher relative dropout rates.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Our trial used a flexible dosing regimen to achieve maximum tolerated doses, based on individual responses.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
              <p id="para310">Although other tricyclic antidepressants are available, we used amitriptyline as it is the most widely prescribed tricyclic worldwide and a first-line agent in most guidelines.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> We did not use gabapentin as there was little rationale for studying two α-2-δ ligands, and because it is a thrice-daily drug, does not have linear pharmacokinetics (unlike pregabalin), and requires a long titration period of up to 2 months to avoid toxicity.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We did not examine the pathway of pregabalin supplemented with duloxetine (P-D) because of the COMBO-DN findings, in which no difference in pain reduction was found if pregabalin was added to duloxetine or vice versa.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, duloxetine was better than pregabalin as an initial treatment at moderate doses and is a once-daily preparation, and thus we opted to examine the D-P pathway. Moreover, adding the P-D pathway would have prolonged the trial by 4 months.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Finally, as both amitriptyline and duloxetine are antidepressants, there was little rationale for combining both.</p>
              <p id="para320">Another strength of OPTION-DM is that it is, to our knowledge, the largest neuropathic pain crossover trial reported to date. All previous DPNP multiperiod, crossover trials had smaller sample sizes,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> while several other studies included neuropathic pain conditions other than DPNP.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Early monitoring of the fidelity of recruitment and retention revealed that recruitment for this year-long, demanding trial was challenging. This was further compounded by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than compromise the integrity of the trial, and with the approval of the independent Trial Steering Committee, the trial continued until an adequate sample size had been achieved to detect a difference of at least 1 NRS point.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Given the identical NRS pain reduction of each pathway, even a significantly larger sample size, more than originally planned, would probably not have altered the principal study outcomes or conclusions.</p>
              <p id="para330">Our trial also explored several secondary endpoints. The head-to-head comparison of the maximum tolerated doses of amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin showed similar efficacies for all three monotherapies, at the end of 6 weeks, although there were significantly less discontinuations due to TEAEs with pregabalin. However, monotherapy resulted in significant pain relief only in just over a third of participants (ie, responders, who reached NRS &lt;3), and 50% pain relief in about 40%. Many patients (ie, non-responders) required combination treatment that resulted in a mean 1 point additional improvement in NRS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>) and an additional 18% of patients reaching NRS lower than 3 and 14% reaching 50% pain relief. A crossover trial done in 56 patients with neuropathic pain (40 with DPNP) treated to maximum tolerated doses of gabapentin, nortriptyline, and their combination over 1-month<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> treatment periods found that combination treatment was more efficacious than either drug alone. Another painful polyneuropathy crossover trial (n=73) of 5-week treatment periods compared the combination of imipramine and pregabalin at moderate doses to either treatment on its own.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The study found that combination treatment was more efficacious in relieving neuropathic pain than each drug on its own, but resulted in higher rates of side-effects.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Despite these results, several international bodies do not recommend combination treatment for DPNP due to insufficient evidence.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although OPTION-DM was not designed as a comparison of monotherapy versus combination treatment, the data make a compelling case for the recommendation of combination treatment of first-line drugs for patients with DPNP with suboptimal response to a monotherapy (figure 3). The P-A pathway had the fewest discontinuations due to TEAEs, and although these results are not definitive, they suggest that the P-A pathway might be the best choice as a first-line treatment for DPNP.</p>
              <p id="para340">Despite large variations in the cost and availability of amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin across the world, it is reassuring that all three are similarly efficacious in relieving pain. This will have real power to inform future clinical guidelines for the management of DPNP as available guidelines provide conflicting recommendations.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Additionally, all monotherapies resulted in improvement of SF-36 quality-of-life domains, sleep, and measures of mood from baseline. However, amitriptyline was significantly better than duloxetine in improving physical functioning and sleep, and pregabalin was better than duloxetine in improving role limitation due to physical health. TEAEs were predictable for the monotherapies, although we observed no significant differences in frequency between the groups, which might partly be due to the use of maximum tolerated doses. Additionally, no significant differences were observed in the frequency of reported serious adverse events. However, compared with some previous studies,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> combination treatment with maximum tolerated doses was well tolerated with few TEAEs compared with monotherapy.</p>
              <p id="para350">In this trial, the absence of a placebo group might be considered a limitation. However, these drugs are in common use all over the world, currently approved by regulatory and advisory bodies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on the basis of a large body of evidence for their efficacy from randomised placebo-controlled trials,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> meta-analyses,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and Cochrane reviews. Furthermore, the addition of a placebo group would have increased the duration of this already long and demanding trial and, after a consultation with our Patient and Public Involvement Panel, we felt it was not ethically justifiable. Indeed, another crossover, combination trial without a placebo group showed a similar magnitude reduction in NRS pain for both monotherapy and combination treatments.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Therefore, although some of the pain reduction will be due to the placebo effect alone, the magnitude of pain reduction is much greater than that achieved by placebo groups.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p id="para360">Another limitation of our study is the relatively high attrition, with only 59% of patients providing primary outcome data for all three pathways and 64% completing at least two pathways. The main reason for this was the long study duration (51 weeks), and thus the considerable demand on patients’ time (eg, delaying annual time off and so on). Nevertheless, our sensitivity analysis for the effect of missing data (including for-cause missing) suggests this primarily affected the precision of the difference rather than causing bias. Additionally, although a longer washout period (eg, 2 weeks) between treatment pathways would have been desirable, we felt this was unethical in this long and demanding trial and could have led to harm and even greater study discontinuations. Finally, although the study was not statistically powered to detect any carryover effect, this is unlikely to have had an effect on the primary outcome at the end of a long treatment period of 16 weeks.</p>
              <p id="para370">In conclusion, the OPTION-DM trial showed that all three treatment pathways delivered similar analgesic efficacy both in terms of statistical and clinical significance. The trial also showed that combination treatment, where needed, was well tolerated and led to significantly better pain relief. Taken together, this study has great potential to influence treatment guidelines for DPNP.</p>
