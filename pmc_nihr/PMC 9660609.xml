                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Large-for-gestational age (LGA) fetuses have an increased risk of shoulder dystocia. This can lead to adverse neonatal outcomes and death. Early induction of labour in women with a fetus suspected to be macrosomic may mitigate the risk of shoulder dystocia. The Big Baby Trial aims to find if induction of labour at 38<sup>+0</sup>–38<sup>+4</sup> weeks’ gestation, in pregnancies with suspected LGA fetuses, reduces the incidence of shoulder dystocia.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The Big Baby Trial is a multicentre, prospective, individually randomised controlled trial of induction of labour at 38<sup>+0</sup> to 38<sup>+4</sup> weeks’ gestation vs standard care as per each hospital trust (median gestation of delivery 39<sup>+4</sup>) among women whose fetuses have an estimated fetal weight &gt;90th customised centile according to ultrasound scan at 35<sup>+0</sup> to 38<sup>+0</sup> weeks’ gestation. There is a parallel cohort study for women who decline randomisation because they opt for induction, expectant management or caesarean section. Up to 4000 women will be recruited and randomised to induction of labour or to standard care. The primary outcome is the incidence of shoulder dystocia; assessed by an independent expert group, blind to treatment allocation, from delivery records. Secondary outcomes include birth trauma, fractures, haemorrhage, caesarean section rate and length of inpatient stay. The main trial is ongoing, following an internal pilot study. A qualitative reporting, health economic evaluation and parallel process evaluation are included.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Shoulder dystocia occurs when an infant’s head has been delivered vaginally and the shoulder becomes stuck behind a woman’s pubic bone. This can lead to maternal and fetal complications. Maternal complications include haemorrhage, third-degree and fourth-degree perineal tears and psychological sequelae. Infant complications include fractures of the clavicle and humerus, brachial plexus injury, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Shoulder dystocia and its complications are common indications for litigation in obstetrics with settlements dealt with by the UK NHS Litigation Authority (now called NHS Resolution) from 250 cases between 2000 and 2010 costing over £100 million.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Fetal macrosomia is a well-described risk factor for shoulder dystocia.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This is variably defined as a neonatal birth weight &gt;4.0 kg or 4.5 kg, or &gt;90th customised or non-customised fetal weight centile. Preventative measures start with antenatal awareness of risk factors including fetal growth and size, maternal obesity and diabetes.</p>
              <p>Earlier delivery is likely to reduce the birth weight of the infant and mitigate the main risk factor for shoulder dystocia. However, it is uncertain whether this strategy would work to reduce shoulder dystocia and its associated complications, and what effect this might have on caesarean section rates and maternal complications after delivery. Research into prevention by induction is timely, in light of conflicting messages. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) does not currently recommend induction of labour for women with a suspected macrosomic fetus in the absence of diabetes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, two systematic reviews and meta-analyses found that induction of labour reduced the risk of shoulder dystocia in women who had a macrosomic fetus.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Both reviews were largely based on the 2015 randomised controlled trial by Boulvain and colleagues of 822 pregnancies with a fetus with an estimated weight greater than the 95th centile.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> While inducing labour may reduce the risk of shoulder dystocia, it has not been shown to decrease adverse neonatal sequelae and induction is associated with a marginal increased risk of operative delivery.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>The management of large-for-gestational age (LGA) and macrosomic pregnancies in obstetrics was the focus of a landmark legal case heard by the UK Supreme Court in 2014.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Mrs Montgomery had type 1 diabetes and had a macrosomic baby, she was concerned about delivering her baby vaginally, but was not adequately informed of the risk of shoulder dystocia. During the delivery, shoulder dystocia occurred leading to a 12 min delay in delivering the infant’s body. Her son suffered from hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. A case was made that as Mrs Montgomery was not adequately informed of the risk of shoulder dystocia and its associated complications, and the alternative modes of delivery, namely caesarean section, she could not make a well-informed decision about the delivery of her son, therefore there was negligence in consent. After failed appeals at the Court of Session and the Inner house the case was finally heard at the UK Supreme court. The Supreme Court judgement in this case highlighted the obligation of clinicians to explain the risks and benefits of all treatment options, including that of no treatment, to women for them give a valid consent. It is therefore imperative to have robust evidence from randomised controlled trials on which to base these discussions. An investigation into the value of induction to reduce the incidence of shoulder dystocia in women with a suspected macrosomic fetus will give women and clinicians the information they need in planning their mode of delivery.</p>
              <p>The research question is ‘does induction of labour at 38<sup>+0</sup> to 38<sup>+4</sup> weeks’ gestation, in pregnancies with suspected LGA fetuses, reduce the incidence of shoulder dystocia?’.</p>

                <p>The Big Baby Trial is a multicentre, prospective, individually randomised controlled trial of induction of labour at 38<sup>+0</sup> to 38<sup>+4</sup> weeks’ gestation versus standard care of fetuses that are LGA according to ultrasound scan at 35<sup>+0</sup> to 38<sup>+0</sup> weeks’ gestation. Our definition of LGA is an estimated fetal weight &gt;90th customised fetal weight centile using the woman’s own customised Gestation Related Optimal Weight (GROW) chart.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These charts provide the standard for assessment of fetal growth and newborn size, are recommended by RCOG Green Top Guidelines<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and are in use in approximately 76% of NHS Trusts and Health Boards. GROW charts adjust for maternal height, weight in early pregnancy, parity, ethnic origin and gender where known. Pathological variables such as diabetes and smoking are not adjusted for.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 15</xref> The GROW 90th customised centile identifies more babies at risk of adverse outcomes than LGA by conventional standards.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref> Furthermore, GROW has been shown to be a better predictor of shoulder dystocia than the UK-WHO birth weight standard.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
                <p>There is a parallel cohort study for women who decline randomisation but wish to participate in research. This cohort includes two subgroups. The first is women who request a planned caesarean section. The second is women who request to be delivered by early induction of labour or expectant management. The primary objective of the cohort study is to provide comparative data on those who choose planned caesarean section and confirm generalisability of the baseline data and primary outcome with the main trial.</p>
                <p>The trial is conducted and managed by the Warwick Clinical Trials Unit and sponsored by the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust. Funding is provided by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) following a commissioned call from the Health Technology Assessment Programme (HTA study reference 16/77/02). The trial is being conducted in accordance with the principals of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).</p>

This confirmation must be completed before randomisation. To be eligible a confirmatory ultrasound scan must be performed between 35<sup>+0</sup> and 38<sup>+0</sup> weeks’ gestation. If the fetus has an estimated fetal weight &gt;90th customised GROW centile during this gestation interval and fulfils the other eligibility criteria, the woman can participate in the trial.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>Data from the West Midlands Perinatal Episode Electronic Record database of 161 936 pregnancies found that the median length of pregnancy for LGA fetuses was 39<sup>+4</sup> weeks’ gestation (277 days). We further ascertained that the weekly increment of fetal weight gain in LGA pregnancies is approximately 200 g. In the trial conducted by Boulvain and colleagues, the difference in fetal weight between the induction and expectant management groups was 287 g.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Based on this, we expect that for a difference of 300 g between the intervention and control arms, an interval of 1.5 weeks is required. Therefore, the intervention window for induction of labour is set at 38<sup>+0</sup> to 38<sup>+4</sup> weeks’ (266–270 days) gestation. This will ensure an approximate average of eleven days separation in gestation days between groups. Induction prior to this window may decrease the risk of shoulder dystocia but would increase the risk of neonatal complications.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> The method of induction is by the usual practice at the participating site Trust.</p>

                  <title>Control</title>
                  <p>The control is standard care. In the UK there is no guidance on mode and timing of birth in LGA pregnancies, with practice varying from hospital to hospital and clinician to clinician. Standard care for this trial is what is provided by that hospital. The trial data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) continue to review the gestation of delivery of the standard care arm and so far, the median gestation of birth in the standard care arm is 39<sup>+4</sup> weeks’ gestation.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome measure is the incidence of shoulder dystocia, defined by the RCOG as ‘a vaginal cephalic delivery that requires additional obstetric manoeuvres to deliver the fetus after the head has delivered and gentle traction has failed’.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These data are being extracted from clinical notes.</p>
                  <p>As the sites are unblinded, all delivery notes are reviewed by an independent expert panel to confirm if shoulder dystocia has occurred. The independent panel consists of a senior obstetrician, a senior neonatologist, a senior midwife and a trainee obstetrician. Delivery notes are anonymised. The independent panel is blind to the trial allocation. Two panel members review each set of notes and categorise the notes into: (1) delivered by caesarean section; (2) no shoulder dystocia; (3) shoulder dystocia; or (4) needs more clarification. Where more clarification is needed, additional information is being sought from trial sites. If there is discrepancy between panel members, the entire panel discusses the case until a consensus decision is made.</p>

                <p>The true incidence of shoulder dystocia in women with a fetus &gt;90th customised GROW centile is unknown. In the trial by Boulvain and colleagues on suspected macrosomia, the incidence of shoulder dystocia, defined as ‘difficulty with delivery of the shoulders not resolved by McRoberts manoeuvre’, in the control arm was 16/411 (3.9%).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the Big Baby Trial, we have used a similar definition of shoulder dystocia, and have estimated the incidence of shoulder dystocia in the control group to be 4%. Boulvain <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> found a relative risk for significant shoulder dystocia in the intervention group to be 0.32 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.85).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Considering this, we have set the effect size to 50% reduction in the primary outcome to 2%. This reduction is considered clinically worthwhile. To achieve a 50% reduction in the primary outcome at a 5% significance level with 90% power, 1626 women would need to be allocated to each arm, with a sample size of 3252 women.</p>
                <p>The sample size for this trial has been increased from 3252 by 23% to 4000. This is to allow for some women giving birth prior to the intervention, and to account for uncertainty in the event rate in the control group. In the trial by Boulvain and colleagues, 31/408 women (7.6%) gave birth prior to the intervention.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The increase in the sample size also takes into account the unknown incidence of the primary outcome, an expected small loss of primary outcome, and any effect of clustering at site—although an unpublished analysis of national Growth Assessment Protocol data by the Perinatal Institute indicated the intra-cluster correlation coefficient for being LGA to be &lt;0.00055, suggesting that any effect will be negligible.</p>
                <p>The trial DMEC is presented with a closed and open report of the data every 6 months of the study. A key event analysis was undertaken once primary outcome data were collected for 1000 participants, given the uncertainty in the sample size estimate. The DMEC was asked to advise if a sample size adjustment was required based on the incidence of shoulder dystocia in the control arm. These data were available on 5 February 2020 and were considered by the DMEC who were unanimous in their satisfaction of the original planned target and recommended that the trial continues to recruit the planned 4000 women.</p>

                <p>Recruitment was assessed when ten sites had been recruiting for 3 months. A formative process evaluation was undertaken to assess barriers to recruitment of sites and participants and barriers to follow-up. This included interviews with ten clinicians to explore adherence to study protocol, impact on workload and impact of the trial on the woman’s decision-making process. Feedback from the pilot study and process evaluation allowed us to run seamlessly into the main study. This will be described in a further manuscript.</p>

                <p>Randomisation is provided by Warwick Clinical Trials Unit using an online web application or telephone. Women are randomised using minimisation, balancing site, fetal weight centile (≤95th or &gt;95th estimated fetal weight centile) and maternal age (≤35 or &gt;35 years of age). To ensure allocation concealment, randomisation only takes place once all the baseline data have been collected.

                <p>Anonymised data are entered into a secured password protected trial database, developed by the programming team at Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, either at site or by the Warwick Clinical Trials Unit. Participants are identified by a unique study number. All data are stored securely and held in accordance with the relevant UK data protection legislation.</p>
                <p>The baseline data collected are maternal height, weight, age, parity, ethnic origin, obstetric history, current obstetric history, tobacco use and use of antenatal corticosteroids. Women are asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L health-related quality of life questionnaire,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> urinary incontinence ICIQ-UI short form<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and questions on faecal incontinence and sexual function at baseline.</p>
                <p>The fetal and neonatal outcomes collected are detailed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. In addition, we are collecting data on the proportion of infants under specialist medical care at 2 months for a problem related to intrapartum experience, a maternal report of infant health at 6 months and in-hospital costs. The maternal outcomes collected are described in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Longer-term maternal outcomes to be collected are described in <xref rid="B2" ref-type="boxed-text">box 2</xref>.</p>
                <p>Follow-up questionnaires are sent to participants at 2 and 6 months post partum. We check the hospital electronic record for notification of a neonatal death in all infants participating in the study who were discharged home, prior to sending the follow-up questionnaires. All study related data are stored in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements and access is restricted to authorised personnel. Trial records and associated documentation will be archived for 25 years for the randomised participants and 10 years for the cohort participants.</p>
                <p>For the parallel cohort we collect the same baseline data as the randomised controlled trial. For women requesting a planned caesarean section we collect the same maternal, neonatal and infant outcomes as the randomised controlled trial. There is a limited data collection for women in the cohort study who request induction or standard care. Women have been consented to be approached for longer-term follow-up.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>All analyses will be by intention to treat at the time of randomisation. The primary analysis will compare the incidence of shoulder dystocia between the intervention and control groups. The comparison will be made using logistic regression models both unadjusted and adjusted for appropriate covariates. Other secondary binary outcomes will be assessed in a similar way. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models; both adjusted and unadjusted analyses will be computed.

                <p>The trial complies with all UK legislation and Warwick Clinical Trials Unit standard operating procedures. Health Research Authority approval and NHS Trust R&amp;D approval was obtained before participants were enrolled in the trial.</p>
                <p>A key ethical challenge in this trial was to ensure that robust informed consent was obtained from participants. The trial requires women to consent to being randomised to a specific management pathway for the birth of their child rather than the standard clinical practice of a shared decision-making process with their clinician. It was therefore an imperative to provide the best possible information to women about the risks and benefits of all management options so they could make an informed decision about trial participation in the wider context of decision-making about their clinical care. In developing our information materials and consent processes we were guided by the standard set by the Supreme Court judgement in Montgomery.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The key steps we took to develop the information and consent processes were:</p>

                <p>Adverse events are being collected from the time of randomisation until delivery. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are being collected from the time of randomisation until 30 days after initial discharge following delivery. Adverse events and SAEs are being identified when collecting outcome data or when completing the 2-month follow-up questionnaires.</p>
                <p>For the trial only, adverse events affecting the woman or her baby which could be potentially related to the pregnancy, delivery or care of the neonate are being collected. Adverse events are being collected for all participants in the randomised controlled trial and participants in the cohort study requesting an elective caesarean section.</p>
                <p>SAEs are only being collected for participants in the randomised controlled trial and need to be reported to Warwick Clinical Trials Unit within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the event. Certain events that would meet the definition of SAEs are common in pregnancy and for this trial do not need to be reported as SAEs. These events are being reported in the trial case report forms and comparative rates will be monitored by the DMEC. SAEs that require immediate reporting for the woman and neonate are described in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>.</p>

                <title>Changes made since funding agreed</title>
                <p>Since submission of the detailed project description to the NIHR-HTA some changes have been made to the protocol and agreed by the Trial Steering Committee, and DMEC. This section details the changes made and reasons for these.</p>
                <p>Initially we predicted we would need 60 sites to reach our recruitment target. Over the course of the trial, it was evident this would need to be increased to 80 sites to enable us to improve recruitment and reach our target of 4000 women randomised in a timely manner. In the application to the NIHR-HTA we wanted to collect outcomes on women in the cohort study who had requested an elective caesarean section. It was decided by the Trial Management Group and Trial Steering Committee that this should be extended to include outcomes on women who decline randomisation but chose either to have an early induction of labour or expectant management. The objective of this group was to provide comparative data on those who choose the timing of the birth and to confirm generalisability of the baseline data and primary outcome. Women with a current intrauterine fetal death were added to the current exclusion criteria as it is inappropriate to randomise these women and different plans would be made regarding their delivery. Prisoners were also added as a new exclusion criterion as there is a different ethical framework for their participation in medical research.</p>
                <p>In the initial application to the NIHR-HTA we suggested that SAEs will be reported for any incidences of stillbirth, maternal death, serious intrapartum injury to the fetus or any other event that could be classified with similar severity. Once the trial had started recruiting a substantial number of SAEs were being reported that were classified as outcomes for the trial. Therefore, more formal guidance was formulated to avoid repetition in the data collection for events that did not meet the definition of SAE and to give clear instructions to the sites about what needed to be reported.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of ongoing COVID-19 risk we are implementing a new consent process to allow for remote electronic consent rather than all consent being taken in person.</p>
