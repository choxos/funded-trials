                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>A new prognostic model has been developed and externally validated, the aim of which is to assist in the management of the blunt chest wall trauma patient in the emergency department (ED). The aim of this trial is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a definitive impact trial investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a new prognostic model for the management of patients with blunt chest wall trauma in the ED.</p>

                  <title>Outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Primary: participant recruitment rate and cliniciansâ€™ use of the STUMBL score. Secondary: composite outcome measure (mortality, pulmonary complications, delayed upgrade in care, unplanned representations to the ED), physical and mental components of quality of life, clinician feedback and health economic data gathering methodology for healthcare resource utilisation.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Quantitative data were analysed using the intention-to-treat principle. 176 patients were recruited; recruitment targets were achieved at all sites. Clinicians used the model in 96% of intervention cases. All feasibility criteria were fully or partially met. After adjusting for predefined covariates, there were no statistically significant differences between the control and intervention periods. Qualitative analysis highlighted that STUMBL was well-received and clinicians would support a definitive trial. Collecting data on intervention costs, health-related quality of life and healthcare resource use was feasible.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>We have demonstrated that a fully powered randomised clinical trial of the STUMBL score is feasible and desirable to clinicians. Minor methodological modifications will be made for the full trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Blunt chest wall trauma accounts for over 15% of all trauma admissions to emergency departments (EDs) worldwide, with reported mortality ranging between 4% and 60%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â€“3</xref> Difficulties in the management of blunt chest wall trauma patients in the ED are becoming increasingly well recognised in the literature.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The patient commonly presents to the ED with no respiratory difficulties, but can develop complications up to approximately 72â€‰hours after initial presentation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â€“4</xref> Clinical symptoms are not considered by most clinicians to be an accurate predictor of outcome following non-life-threatening blunt chest wall trauma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â€“7</xref> Decisions regarding the appropriate level of care required by the patient following discharge from the ED are therefore difficult and are further compounded by the lack of current national guidelines. Improvements in identification of high-risk patients on initial assessment in the ED could lead to a reduction in these poor outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p>
              <p>A new prognostic model (STUMBL Score) to assist the management of blunt chest wall trauma patients in the ED has been developed and externally validated in a large multicentre study.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5â€“7</xref> Guidelines recommend that prognostic models should not be used in clinical practice until an impact trial has been completed, in which the clinical application of the model has been tested.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> The aim of this trial was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a future definitive trial, which will determine whether the prognostic model can be used safely and effectively in clinical practice in the UK.</p>

                <p>The trial had a 5-month recruitment period, and each hospital aimed to recruit 30â€“80 patients. This was the minimum number considered necessary to test data collection processes based on existing recommendations for meaningful estimates of parameters of interest.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This recruitment period also allowed for loss to follow-up, low response rates with follow-up surveys and difficulties with recruiting at weekends if research nurses only worked Monday to Friday.</p>

The model was used during initial patient assessment and provided a suggestion of the appropriate management (whether the patient could be safely discharged home or needed admission to either a ward or aÂ critical care). Participants were asked to complete one survey (SF-12v1)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> on initial presentation and two more surveys at 6â€‰weeks (SF-12v1 and a Client Services Receipt Inventory (CSRI)).

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Quantitative analyses were performed on Stata V.15.1 SE using the intention-to-treat principle and were not powered to detect clinically important effects. Results are presented as numbers (percentages), means (SD) and medians (interquartile ranges) where non-normally distributed. Baseline characteristics between groups were completed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisherâ€™s exact test. The risk score was also calculated retrospectively for control cases for baseline comparisons purposes only.</p>
                <p>A binary composite outcome measure was calculated, indicating if the participant had experienced at least one of the contributing factors (mortality, unplanned representation to the ED, delayed upgrade in care or onset of pulmonary complications). Intervention/control groups were compared using logistic regression analysis (using exact logistic regression where there were zero-count cells). Covariates included age at theÂ time of presentation, the number of clinically suspected rib fractures, preinjury use of anticoagulants, the presence of pre-existing chronic lung disease and oxygen saturation on initial assessment in the ED. Analysis of individual components of the composite outcome measure was completed using the same method.</p>
                <p>Sensitivity analyses were undertaken following clinical review of the data. The following factors were considered: the type of logistic regression analysis used, inclusion of additional covariates, representations leading to immediate discharge and unrelated representations/deaths. Each was analysed individually, on the composite outcome measure, with all covariates included.</p>
                <p>AÂ purposive sample of the clinicians based on seniority, location and trial participation were invited to take part in a short interview in which they were asked to discuss the model in relation to their clinical practice. Two research nurses (where available, the Royal Gwent Hospital only had one research nurse) from each site were asked to attend a focus group in which the trialâ€™s methodology was discussed. One site was unable to attend. Focus group and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service. The qualitative researcher (COâ€™N) monitored this process; transcripts were checked for accuracy against the original recording and were anonymised in accordance with best practice standards. The cleaned and anonymised transcripts were uploaded into NVIVO V.11.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
                <p>Thematic analysis was used to analyse the transcripts using a code book, which developed initially from the background literature and feedback on the training as well as issues thatÂ emerged through the process of constant comparison, which underpins qualitative data analysis. Due to the small numbers of transcripts, the coded transcripts were checked by a second qualitative researcher, using the coder comparison query tool.</p>
                <p>Health economic analysis focused on establishing the most appropriate framework for a future health economic analysis. The feasibility of collecting data on quality of life and resource use was assessed, along with a provisional assessment of cost categories associated with the intervention (eg,Â staff training time). To capture resource use by patients from an NHS/PSS (National Health Service/Personal Social Service) perspective, an adapted resource usage questionnaire was used. Data were assessed to examine the completeness of data captured, such as response rate and missing items.</p>

              <p>All sites were able to recruit over the 5-month period, and there were no difficulties implementing the stepped wedge design (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>). There were no obvious differences between numbers recruited at each site when considering major trauma centre status, with the Royal Gwent Hospital recruiting 31 patients, Musgrove Park Hospital recruiting 47 patients (plus one withdrawal of consent), Salford Royal Hospital recruiting 38 patients and Manchester Royal Infirmary recruiting 60 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). There was some inconsistency around screening/consenting between sites. For example, research nurse availability affected the recruitment and consent process in smaller sites. Another inconsistency occurred as one site did not keep a screening log throughout the trial.</p>

It proved impractical to obtain precise figures for the number of clinicians working in EDs over the trial period, but the information available suggests that noÂ one dissented from using the tool and all were appropriately trained. There were initial difficulties in obtaining follow-up questionnaire data; however, response rates improved once telephone and email follow-ups were introduced, justifying the amber status. Clinical follow-up data were only from hospital records (ie, participants who were admitted or subsequently represented to hospital).</p>

There were a significantly higher number of road traffic accidents in the control group (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). To understand the differences between groups, we retrospectively calculated the risk score for participants in the control group using routinely collected data. We found that the intervention group scored significantly higher on the prognostic model than the control group.</p>

                <p>The type of regression analysis undertaken had the largest effect on the results. Due to the low number of events seen, we considered the impact of using an exact logistic regression (using the Stata exlogistic command) and a Penalised Maximum Likelihood Estimation (the â€˜Firth methodâ€™, using the Stata firthlogit command). Exact logistic regression produced results consistent with our initial calculation; the Firth method produced results that were more favourable to the intervention. Further analysis that considered otherÂ covariates made little difference to the overall findings, nor did whether the prognostic modelâ€™s management guidance was followed, accounting for the unrelated deaths/representations, or our assumption that all pulmonary complications diagnosed on the day of randomisation were present at admission. Excluding representations leading to a discharge had a large impact on the size of the 95% CI, but this may be due to very low number of events remaining for analysis (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP3">supplementary file 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>Some data did not appear to be missing entirely at random, with one site missing considerably more data than the others. Exploration suggested that this was due to lower research nurse levels and unforeseeable circumstances. There was difficulty in obtaining completed CSRI forms compared with SF-12s. Some CSRIs were completed by research nurses using available NHS records and contacting General Practitioner (GPs), particularly in one of the early intervention sites, leading to a higher proportion completed than would otherwise be the case.</p>

                <title>Qualitative results</title>
                <p>Four research nurses attended the focus group and nine clinician interviews were completed. Thirty-six training feedback questionnaires were completed. Following coding, three main themes covering issues of process, impact and mainstreaming were identified.</p>
                <p>Trial processes refer to informantsâ€™ perspectives on the running of the trial from planning and design issues through to data collection, publicity and training. Staff were positive about the trial, they liked the stepped wedge design and data collection was largely unproblematic. The use of social media was commended and staff were keen for this to be retained. Using Twitter to drive patient recruitment was highlighted by everyone as a great motivator and a way to encourage team involvement and to drive recruitment.</p>
                <p>The consent model used in this trial, and the alternative of presumed consent, was not considered contentious by the teams. The training was well received and could be offered in different formats. Data collection tools and improvements made to them during the trial were considered appropriate. Some improvements such as telephone follow-ups worked well. Otherwise, there were no other suggested changes regarding trial processes. It was clear that staff appreciated the value of the STUMBL Score and would support a definitive trial to ensure its wider implementation.</p>

                <title>Health economic evaluation</title>
                <p>There were no significant differences in quality of life between control and intervention groups at either baseline or follow-up. However, analysis only included complete cases (n=126 of 176), with no imputation undertaken, and should be viewed with caution. The mean training time was 31â€‰min (SD: 24â€‰min), and it usually took place at a traineeâ€™s place of work. As the pay grades for clinicians varied, training costs varied substantially between Â£6.45 and Â£108 per session (mean = Â£31.82, SD = Â£20.6). When training could be carried out in a traineeâ€™s place of work, the cost per person was minimised.</p>
                <p>The CSRI and SF-12 captured the data required for a full economic evaluation in the main trial. Measures can be taken to adapt the instruments to capture key data that are likely to have a greater impact on costs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This is the first trial to test the feasibility of conducting a cluster-randomised controlled trial into the effectiveness of a prognostic model for the management of blunt chest wall trauma patients presenting to the ED. All feasibility criteria were met, suggesting that progression to a full impact trial is possible.</p>
              <p>This trial has highlighted some minor modifications that need to be made to the methods prior to moving forward to the full trial. Research nurse availability varied substantially between sites. In one of the smaller (trauma unit) sites, difficulties in patient recruitment were noted due to the fact that there was only one research nurse working on the trial, so out-of-hours recruitment was not possible. This suggests thatÂ capacity is something to consider carefully when recruiting sites for any future definitive trial. Reliance on research nurses to recruit participants, rather clinicians recruiting as part of patient management, will need consideration when planning the future trial. A retrospective consent model was discussed in some clinician interviews, which may need consideration as one strategy to improve recruitment numbers.</p>
              <p>Participant outcomes were compared toÂ ensure that there were no large differences between groups and that we remain in equipoise regarding use of the model in EDs. Although analysis of the composite outcome measure suggests a difference between groups, this may be because the two major trauma centres were the last sites to transition to the intervention (and therefore had longer in the control phases) and collectively, they recruited most patients to the trial. The intervention group wasÂ significantly older, more severely injured and scored higher on the prognostic model than the control group (using retrospective scores for the control group). A larger number of sites will be used in the future trial, which should reduce baseline variation. Overall, the trial population was younger than previous research<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6</xref> by the group which may be due to the inclusion of a higher proportion of major trauma centres. Due to a low number of adverse events compared with previous research, the regression analysis produced wide CIs. This trial is not powered to detect differences in outcomes, and therefore any differences between groups should be considered with caution.</p>
              <p>The complication rate was lower than that reported in our development and validation work.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6</xref> This could be explained by the proportion of major trauma centres included in this trial, when compared with the previous work, although this would need further investigation. This information will prove useful when calculating the sample for a full trial.</p>
              <p>There was difficulty in obtaining completed CSRI surveys. As a result, some CSRIs were completed by research nurses using available NHS records and contacting GPs. The most costly data gathered from the CSRI questionnaire would normally be inpatient stays and outpatient visits, especially when there are multiple stays/visits following the initial visit to the ED. Unfortunately, an oversight of the timing of the CSRI meant questions only asked about the 6â€‰weeks following discharge, resulting in a failure to capture costs involved in the initial ED treatment. This is a key cost driver, and in a full trial, the CSRI questions would be amended to capture recall since arrival at ED.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this work has demonstrated that progression to the full definitive impact trial is feasible, with some minor modifications.</p>
