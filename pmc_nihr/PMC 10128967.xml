              <abstract>
                <p>Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for obesity. However, around one in five people experience significant weight regain. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) teaches acceptance of and defusion from thoughts and feelings which influence behaviour, and commitment to act in line with personal values. To test the feasibility and acceptability of ACT following bariatric surgery a randomised controlled trial of 10 sessions of group ACT or Usual Care Support Group control (SGC) was delivered 15–18 months post bariatric surgery (ISRCTN registry ID: ISRCTN52074801). Participants were compared at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months using validated questionnaires to assess weight, wellbeing, and healthcare use. A nested, semi-structured interview study was conducted to understand acceptability of the trial and group processes. 80 participants were consented and randomised. Attendance was low for both groups. Only 9 (29%) ACT participants completed &gt; = half of the sessions, this was the case for 13 (35%) SGC participants. Forty-six (57.5%) did not attend the first session. At 12 months, outcome data were available from 19 of the 38 receiving SGC, and from 13 of the 42 receiving ACT. Full datasets were collected for those who remained in the trial. Nine participants from each arm were interviewed. The main barriers to group attendance were travel difficulties and scheduling. Poor initial attendance led to reduced motivation to return. Participants reported a motivation to help others as a reason to join the trial; lack of attendance by peers removed this opportunity and led to further drop out. Participants who attended the ACT groups reported a range of benefits including behaviour change. We conclude that the trial processes were feasible, but that the ACT intervention was not acceptable as delivered. Our data suggest changes to recruitment and intervention delivery that would address this.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Across the world there are over a billion individuals living with obesity (13% prevalence of a BMI &gt;30kg/m2) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is associated with a host of negative health outcomes, including a 48% increased risk of mortality following COVID-19 infection for individuals living with obesity compared to individuals without obesity (pre-vaccination rates) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Within the UK, 28% of the population is living with obesity and obesity was a primary or secondary factor in over one million admissions to NHS hospitals in the year 2019/2020 [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Bariatric surgery is highly effective in treating obesity and its associated comorbidities; in patients with a BMI of over 35 it is more effective than nonsurgical interventions in bringing about weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, a 2021 systematic review found that 17.6% of patients still experienced significant weight regain of 10% or more [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which may necessitate further invasive procedures (bariatric surgery costs upwards of £10,000) and a return of comorbid conditions [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282849.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that bariatric surgery should be supplemented by psychological support, though it does not specify a particular therapy modality [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cognitive behavioural interventions have been found to be effective for weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, a recent systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which found only nine randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of psychological intervention provided to bariatric surgery patients, concluded that there is a lack of evidence in this population. High-quality studies are therefore needed, not least to understand the mechanisms through which cognitive and behavioural therapies may aid bariatric surgery patients.</p>
              <p>Analysis of the psychological profile of patients living with obesity found poor self-regulation and negative mood as the strongest predictors of variance in weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Eating psychopathology was associated with a 2.2 odds ratio in the weight regain group compared to the non-weight regain group in a recent systematic analysis [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A longitudinal study of over 400 bariatric surgery patients found that, among others, depression, increased hedonic salience of food cues, and distress intolerance predicted poorer weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These mechanisms can be targeted by third wave cognitive behavioural therapies (3wCBT) which use principles of mindfulness and non-judgemental awareness.</p>
              <p>Support for this comes from a recent systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (n = 37 studies) which found 3wCBT to be more effective for weight loss than standard behavioural treatment; the most consistent evidence was for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). That review excluded studies of bariatric patientsbut another review focused on this population ([<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] n = 10 studies) found evidence for acceptance-based approaches in supporting wellbeing. Only one randomised controlled trial of ACT in bariatric patients [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (n = 39) was identified, in which those receiving six weeks of ACT demonstrated greater improvements in disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, QoL and acceptance of weight related thoughts and feelings than those receiving treatment as usual, with effects consistent at 6 months post intervention [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282849.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the participants varied in their post-surgery time, ranging from 4–38 months, with a mean of 15.5 so the ideal timing of psychological intervention is unknown [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As the mechanisms hypothesized to drive weight gain will take time to express as new obesogenic behaviours to target in therapy [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], therapies targeting post bariatric surgery patients may be more beneficial if given at a later stage. Multiple studies have established that 20–30% of patients regain weight within 24 months of surgery, unfortunately this is also when patients may be discharged from secondary care [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The present feasibility RCT was designed to determine whether ACT delivered in this window, 15–18 months post-bariatric surgery, is acceptable to patients, and to guide the methodology of a future trial assessing effectiveness.</p>
              <p>In previous studies of ACT for weight management [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282849.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a range of outcomes, such as disordered eating, cravings, body dissatisfaction, quality of life and weight loss have been used with alterations in psychological flexibility, a core component of ACT, was suggested to be the primary mediator of benefits in the one RCT. However other mediators for weight loss have been proposed [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], so a wide range of treatment outcomes will be measured and tested for potential mediators and moderators of effect.</p>
              <p>Despite guidelines recommending psychological interventions in post-operative care, routine clinical practice has not caught up [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and evidence to guide clinicians in the type of therapy is limited. If evidence based interventions were available, this support could reduce the costs to the patient and society associated with weight regain and its sequelae. The aim of this feasibility RCT is to determine the acceptability of ACT group therapy in post-bariatric surgery patients and to provide insight into the optimal methods for an RCT assessing the effectiveness of ACT in this patient population. Acceptability of the intervention was assessed as group attendance and through interview data.</p>

                <p>This was a feasibility study for a single-centre, parallel-group, single-blind, two-arm trial, with randomisation to either a 10 weeks ACT group therapy or Usual Care Support Group control (SGC). Favourable ethical opinion was obtained from London-Westminster REC (18/LO/1256). The trial was registered at Researchregistry.com, UIN: 3959 (date registered: 10 April 2018); ISRCTN registry ID: ISRCTN52074801.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>All participants were adults (≥18years) post bariatric-surgery (&gt;15 to &lt; 18 months) at a London-based weight management centre. Patients who expressed suicidal ideation (score &gt;0 on Q9 of thePHQ-9 [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or at psychiatry assessment), or who were unable to communicate in English, or who were unable to commit to attendance were excluded.</p>
                <p>Initially, potentially eligible patients were given a Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and PHQ-9 at their regular post-surgical follow up appointments, but due to reduced operating capacity in the previous year, recruitment was hampered by low numbers in follow up clinics. Therefore, all eligible patients were contacted and posted or emailed the PIS. Interested patients were approached by the RA and an appointment made to obtain consent and baseline data. Written consent was obtained for all participants. Recruitment ceased when the target was reached.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>This was performed by an independent researcher running R program scripts [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The randomisation method uses permuted blocks of variable size, randomly varying from two to six participants. All eligibility criteria were checked prior to randomisation. Each patient was given a unique participant number which was sent to the researcher running the R program. The program generated a randomised patient study number assigning them to either the ACT or SGC. This was emailed back to SS who then informed the participant of their allocation and provided details of where and when to attend. Other team members, including the statistician, were blind to allocation, but the patients knew to which arm they had been randomised. Approximately equal numbers were allocated to each condition.</p>

                <p>We aimed to recruit 58 participants.

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>Primary outcomes related to the feasibility of the trial. Measures of the success of recruitment, data collection and acceptability of trial procedures included (1) willingness of participants to be randomised, i.e. the number of participants who drop out of the study after they had been randomised, (2) number of eligible patients attending clinic i.e. the percentage of patients who met eligibility criteria at screening, (3) follow-up rates, i.e. the percentage of participants retained until 12 month follow-up and providing complete datasets, (4) adherence to the intervention or control i.e. number of sessions attended, (5) reasons for attrition, (6) time needed to collect data.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes explored related to obesity, health and wellbeing. The following validated measures were used: King’s Obesity Staging Criteria [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults (ICECAP-A) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], Brief Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], Weight in kilograms and ACT processes using: Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Drexel Defusion Scale (DDS) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Physical Activity Acceptance Questionnaire (PAAQ) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and Food Craving Acceptance and Awareness Questionnaire (FAAQ) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
                <p>Economic costs were calculated from the perspective of the NHS. Annual staff training budgets typically fund ACT training, which costs £450 (ranging from £350 to £550) for a healthcare professional with an existing psychology qualification. The ACT group was led by a Band 7 psychologist as part of their regular duties. A Band 4 psychology graduate with no formal therapy training led the support group. The CSRI was used to track healthcare resource use during the trial period [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Using CSRI data, service utilisation costs for 2019/2020 were calculated by multiplying resource use by the appropriate unit cost. For service delivery, such as hospital stay costs, we also used national standard tariffs. Unit costs from the Unit Cost of Health and Social Care 2020 and NHS Reference Costs 2020 were used in the analysis. The EQ-5D was used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALY [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]).</p>
                <p>Outcome measures were completed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months follow up, except for weight and the King’s Obesity Staging Criteria [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] which were collected at baseline and 12 months only. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Baseline data were collected face to face at routine clinic appointments; 3- and 6-month FU data were collected via telephone. We planned to collect 12-month data face to face, but due to the global pandemic this was mostly collected by phone.</p>
                <p>Participants from both arms were invited to be interviewed after the 12 month follow up in order to understand acceptability of the trial and group processes. Recruitment stopped once equal numbers from each arm had been recruited and the team agreed that data saturation had been achieved. The ACT group participants also completed further ACT process measures at each session as part of the intervention: openness to experience (OE), behavioural awareness (BA), and valued action (VA).</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted for the feasibility and potential primary and secondary outcomes at baseline and each follow-up time point. Although this feasibility study was not powered to detect differences between groups in questionnaire-based outcomes, multi-level linear regression models were fitted to the data from each questionnaire to explore the direction and magnitude of effects. This method of analysis uses data from all time-points, and provides unbiased estimates, providing data can be assumed to be missing-at-random.</p>
                <p>A cost-consequence analysis (CCA) was performed from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective. This analysis is commonly used in the literature to investigate the intervention’s impact on costs and health outcomes in a feasibility study [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282849.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The analysis listing the cost and outcomes associated with ACT (the treatment group) and the Usual Care Support Group (the control group) separately, allowing decision- makers to compare the relative value of the treatment options, and by calculating resources use and outcomes for each treatment. Regression analysis was used to adjust for patients’ age, gender, baseline health-related quality of life, and body mass index. The intervention costs were calculated based on the activities involved in delivering the programmes such as staff salaries, administrative and managerial costs. Total costs of the individuals in the two groups were estimated by multiplying the quantity of the resource use with the unit costs of health and social care in the NHS [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We presented the incremental costs (mean and standard deviation) associated with the intervention alongside the benefits (if any) identified in the trial when compared with the usual care group.</p>
                <p>Interview data were analysed using a directed content analysis technique [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with deductive coding. Transcripts were uploaded to NVivo 12 QSR [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Following familiarisation with the transcripts, the “Theoretical Framework of Acceptability of Healthcare Interventions” (TFA) [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] was used as the coding scheme. The TFA includes seven constructs of acceptability: affective attitude (i.e. how individuals feel about participating), perceived effectiveness (i.e. the extent to which the intervention is perceived to be likely to achieve its purpose), intervention coherence (i.e. participants’ understanding of the intervention and how it works), ethicality (i.e. the fit of trial and intervention with an individual’s values), burden (i.e. the perceived amount of effort required to participate), self-efficacy (i.e. participants’ confidence that they can perform required behaviours) and opportunity costs (i.e. the extent to which benefits, profits, or values must be given up to participate). Data relating to the six ACT processes were also coded for ACT group participants and categorised under the ‘perceived effectiveness’ and ‘intervention coherence’ acceptability constructs.</p>
                <p>Data relating to participation in the trial and SCG and in the ACT intervention were coded separately. Codes were agreed between the coding team (MB, HG, SB, EB) using one transcript before MB and EB coded all transcripts independently. Similarities and differences in views between the groups were highlighted and examples of disconfirming data were sought for each acceptability construct. The coding frequencies were presented as counts along with supporting quotes for each TFA component. Coding was discussed and agreed at multidisciplinary team meetings including the service user advisors.</p>
                <p>This was a change from protocol where inductive thematic analysis was planned. However, given findings of successful recruitment but high attrition, it was felt that using a focused, structured approach to understand the acceptability, of both the trial processes and experience of the ACT group, would enable identification of specific areas to be addressed in future work. The TFA has been applied in this way to various interventions, including a men’s mental health promotion program [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] a digital return to work intervention for common mental disorders [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and an HIV differentiated care intervention for formerly incarcerated people re-entering community settings [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Its use therefore enhances the applicability of study findings by structuring findings according to recognised constructs of acceptability.</p>

Only 9 (29%) ACT participants completed &gt; = half of the sessions, this was the case for 13 (35%) SGC participants. This means that it is unlikely that any participant received a ‘dose’ of ACT that would be expected to be sufficient to facilitate change.

                <p>Data from all questionnaires at each time point are included in the S1 Questionnaire data and include the levels of missing data. Changes from baseline and differences between groups: Findings from the multi-level linear regression models for the outcome measures are provided in <xref rid="pone.0282849.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. Given that this was a feasibility study, not powered for efficacy, and the high levels of attrition, findings should be interpreted with caution. There were no statistically significant differences between groups and similar patterns across outcomes, but there are some interesting points to note. The mean change in weight from baseline to 12 months (Kgs) where a positive value represents weight gain and a negative value represents weight loss, was 2.6 (95% CI (-4.3 to 9.5); n = 13) and -1.4 (95% CI (-11.9 to 9.1; n = 10) in the SCG and ACT groups respectively (t-test for difference in means p = 0.47). However, considering individual responses, the number of participants who lost or maintained weight to within &lt;2% of baseline was 8/13 (62%; 95% CI (32% to 86%) in SCG and 5/10 (50%; 95% CI (19% to 81%) in ACT, suggesting that average differences between groups were affected by large intra-individual variation in response (see <xref rid="pone.0282849.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
                <p>Health service use and costs: The ACT group had fewer hospital admissions (0 percent vs 13 percent), A&amp;E visits (7.6 percent vs 20 percent), social worker visits (0 percent vs 7 percent), district nurse or health visitor visits (0 percent vs 6 percent), and visits to ‘therapy in the community’ (0 percent vs 6 percent) (0 percent vs 7 percent). They were more likely to visit an outpatient hospital (46 percent vs 26 percent), a GP (69 percent vs 40 percent) or a practise nurse (46 percent vs 27 percent), any telephone consultation (31 percent vs 20 percent), any day centre visit (38 percent vs 7 percent), a chiropractor (7 percent vs 0 percent), or any counselling, psychiatry, or community mental health visit (8 percent vs 7 percent). Except for any day centre visit (p = 0.04), no differences between groups were statistically significant (please see <xref rid="pone.0282849.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>
                <p>The cost of providing ACT services includes one hour of clinical psychologist time (£70) divided among ten patients. The training costs approximately £2.25 per patient (£450 per year for 200 patients). As a result, the total cost of providing ACT services is £72.25 per patient. SGC service delivery costs include one hour of assistant psychologist time (£34) divided among ten patients. This equates to £3.4 per patient or £34 for ten sessions. Last year, the ACT group spent £560 on medical expenses, while the usual care group spent £441. The intervention cost £633 for the ACT group and £475 for the usual/standard care group.</p>
                <p>QALYs (Quality-adjusted Life Years): The unadjusted mean QALYs from baseline to 12 month follow-up were: ACT group = 0.61 (SD = 0.26); SGC = 0.59 SD = 0.37. The study only included 32 patients with baseline and 12-month EQ-5D measurements (19 in the usual care group and 13 in the ACT group). We then used a regression analysis to estimate the differences in QALY between two groups, adjusting for patients’ age, gender, baseline health-related quality of life, and body mass index. The ACT group was associated with a 0.07 point reduction in QALY (P&gt;0.05) in the adjusted analysis.

                <p>Eighteen participants were interviewed: nine from each arm (female n = 11). Three interviews were face to face and the subsequent 15 were by telephone; interview duration ranged from 35 to 65 minutes. Three of those interviewed did not attend any session (ACT n = 2, SGC n = 1), this was due to health reasons and being unable to attend due to other commitments. The 15 remaining participants interviewed attended from 1 to 9 sessions (ACT median = 5, SGC median = 8), though the ACT participants were able to ‘catch up’ on course content with the psychologist prior to the subsequent session.</p>

                  <p>All acceptability constructs were coded, except ‘self efficacy’ was not coded for the trial or SGC attendance, and though ‘opportunity costs’ was coded in relation to attending sessions it was not coded specifically in relation to participating in either group.

Findings are presented as themes within each acceptability construct, supported by illustrative quotes (quotes are linked to a participant via participant number (1–80), gender (m/F) and the number of sessions attended out of 10).</p>

                  <p>All participants, except one, reported feeling positive at the time of enrolment about participating in the trial. The exception was someone who suggested that they felt obliged by their clinician to attend (9FA1); this person dropped out after the first session. The possibility that dissatisfaction with group allocation could explain the observed high attrition rates, particularly for the first session, was explored directly. Two participants declared a prior preference for the ACT group (19FA9, 20FC8). This worked out for one (19FA9), while the other was randomised to the SGC (20FC8). Nevertheless, this person participated in the trial and attended 8 out of 10 sessions. In addition, the groups were held on different days, and some participants (35FA0) stated being unavailable to attend their allocated group but would have attended on the other day. Group or timing preferences may therefore have been a factor contributing to low attendance for the first session.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This trial tested the feasibility of delivering an RCT of ACT <italic toggle="yes">versus</italic> SCG. Overall, we found that the methods of the trial were feasible. All eligible participants were invited to participate, and we recruited and consented more than planned. Those who remained in the trial completed the outcome measures satisfactorily which allowed planned analyses to be conducted. However, the trial suffered from considerable attrition. This was linked to very low attendance at the groups which was similar for the ACT and SCG and was low even on the first session where only 57% attended.</p>
              <p>It appeared that although data collection was hampered by lack of retention, other trial processes (i.e. recruitment, consent, data collection in those retained in the trial) would be feasible for a future trial but that the intervention, as delivered, may not be. We therefore decided to explore acceptability of the trial processes and intervention in detail using an established framework–The TFA [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This proved to be useful for capturing aspects of the trial and intervention which could be targeted to improve future trials. For instance, the acceptability constructs of ‘burden’ and ‘opportunity costs’ featured in interviews; participants cited session timing and a range of travel difficulties as reasons for non-attendance at initial and subsequent sessions. This is supported by studies investigating bariatric patients’ attendance at routine follow up [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282849.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which has also been found to be low, with ‘geographic distance’ cited as a reason, along with family, professional and health problems. This suggests that future trials should make use of telehealth care tools to decrease the costs and burden of attendance. Cognitive and behavioural telehealth interventions have been shown to increase attendance compared to in person delivery [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and telehealth based behavioural interventions for obesity have been found not to be inferior to in-person interventions when assessed against weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our interview data also suggested that the acceptability construct of ‘ethicality’ was important. This refers to the fit of trial and intervention with an individual’s values. The intervention fitted with what the participants said they wanted (i.e. information and psychological support), and satisfaction with this was expressed as evidenced by the positive comments coded under the ‘Affective Attitude’ acceptability construct. However, joining the trial was commonly motivated by a desire to ‘help others’ or ‘give back’. This, and another expressed desire, namely to meet other patients and share their experiences, was thwarted by the high levels of attrition in both groups This may explain why poor attendance at the first session led to reduced motivation to return, with subsequent drop out having a negative impact on future attendance.</p>
              <p>Further, our finding that participants consented to join the study out of a motivation to help others, may suggest that they were not ‘ready’ for therapy themselves, an idea supported by our PPI advisors. The impact on weight loss of ‘readiness’ or motivation for bariatric surgery has been tested retrospectively [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and prospectively [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], but no association with readiness to change scores or motivation such as changing appearance, fitness or medical concerns has been found. In other populations, the process of selecting patients suitable for therapy has also been studied with the aim of reducing attrition and improving outcomes, however the construct of readiness for therapy is complex and no established measures exist [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282849.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Nevertheless “composite psychological variables” including combinations of increased self-esteem, coping skills and ability to use support have been found to predict weight loss in post-bariatric surgery through their effects on eating behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0282849.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It is possible that patients approaching therapy from a purely altruistic point of view are not accepting of their own need for help and so their ability to use the support offered by therapy is reduced. Further trials of therapy for bariatric patients should include exploration of who responds best and why in order to inform future recruitment of suitable candidates.</p>
              <p>With regard to perceived effectiveness and intervention coherence, few participants received a sufficient course of ACT for it to be meaningful. It is, therefore, unsurprising that no trends indicating a difference between the groups were identified. However, participants who attended the ACT groups reported some benefits and behaviour changes linked to ACT processes, especially regarding contacting the present moment, becoming more aware of behaviours and improved self efficacy. ACT group participants varied in their understanding of ACT processes, this appeared linked to attendance, but participants’ description of the intervention was generally simplistic, with few able to give concrete examples of the processes covered in sessions and homework.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, this work has demonstrated that it is possible to deliver group ACT as part of routine care post bariatric care with minimal additional cost to services. Future trials could impact on large numbers of individuals and, if successful, reduce NHS costs significantly. For instance, in 2017/18 (latest available data NHS digital) there were 6,627 hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of obesity and a main or secondary procedure of bariatric surgery; an increase of 2% on 2016/17 (6,492). However, approximately 20% of bariatric surgery patients regain lost weight with cost implications of £10,000 per re-operation as well as return of co-morbidities such as type-2 diabetes. If ACT is found, in future trials, to be effective at preventing weight regain, significant saving could be made. This study also highlights that the decision regarding the best primary and secondary outcome measures for a full RCT of ACT would require the careful consideration of many aspects of the proposed trial, including consensus in the most relevant patient-centred outcome to demonstrate efficacy. The data collected during this feasibility study for a range of outcomes would be sufficient to inform the necessary sample size calculations for a future trial through estimates of standard deviation of the chosen outcome, but the final decision on the choice of primary endpoint should be taken by the research team following extensive consultation with patient representatives.</p>
              <p>A strength of this feasibility trial is that, to reduce selection bias, we invited all eligible patients to participate. We noted early on that there was low attendance, so we ran additional iterations of the groups which confirmed that retention to the group rather than recruitment to the trial was an issue. We then explored acceptability of the trial and group processes with both high and low attenders using an established framework. This allowed us to pinpoint areas to address in a future trial to increase acceptability and retention. Nevertheless, due to the lack of attendance, few people received a meaningful level of the ACT intervention, so we are unable to recommend a definitive primary outcome for a future trial or suggest the processes by which ACT may work.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that an RCT of group ACT is feasible to deliver in bariatric patients post-surgery, but that the intervention is not feasible or acceptable as delivered. Low attendance at groups, due mainly to travel and scheduling difficulties, reduced acceptability as participants were unable to gain the peer support or to provide the help to others that had motivated them to join the trial. This suggests that acceptability, and hence retention, could be improved in a future full trial of effectiveness by using online intervention delivery whilst taking care to maximise participant satisfaction by providing opportunity for interaction with peers. The data from this trial also suggest the need for future research to explore the factors which influence when and which bariatric patients are most likely to benefit from psychological therapy and why in order to inform recruitment of suitable candidates to trials.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors reported about the results of a randomized controlled feasibility trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of ACT following bariatric surgery a randomized controlled trial of 10 sessions of group ACT or Usual Care Support Group control (SGC) was delivered 15- 18 months post bariatric surgery they concluded, that the trial</p>
              <p>processes were feasible, but that the ACT intervention was not acceptable as delivered. Our data suggest changes to recruitment and intervention delivery that would address this.</p>
              <p>First of all I would like to congratulate the authors for providing and consistently reporting this feasibility study. I do have some minor comments to the presentation, which could be easily addressed in a review.</p>
              <p>The appropriate guideline is the "CONSORT statement on Pilot and Feasibility Trials (see BMJ 2016; 355:i5239 <ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj" ext-link-type="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj</ext-link>. i5239)". Please use this checklist, although the difference appears to be minor. The extra statement on page 6 might not be necessary.</p>
              <p>p5: Is it possible to give a variable, by which "Acceptability of the ACT group therapy" is assessed.</p>
              <p>p7 Randomization. Please give more details, e.g. the randomization procedure, software (R software package) and how the random allocation was implemented. Please give more details with respect to blinding. Single blinding is not very specific. How is blinding implemented.</p>
              <p>P7 I fully understand, that a strong sample size argument could not be given here. But when the primary endpoint is specified, a precision argument for estimation could be given - even post hoc - to illustrate the argument.</p>
              <p>p8. Please include a table with the descriptive measures of the secondary outcome scores.</p>
              <p>P10 or elsewhere: Could you derive some recommendation about the trails primary endpoint variable. Could you derive some ideas about the minimal detectable difference, i.e. the minimal difference to be detected resulting in a change of patient care?</p>
              <p>p11: Please skip the p-values You may argue from the estimates of the difference and CI'S from the multilevel models</p>
              <p>Rosenberger WF, Lachin JM. (2015) Randomization in Clinical Trials, Second Edition. Wiley, New York. DOI:10.1002/9781118742112</p>
              <p>1. In general, p-values should be given with at least 3 decimal digits to avoid misinterpretation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: As the manuscript title states, this study addresses a critical need. Namely, the provision of psychological care to support weight management post-bariatric surgery. This is a well designed feasibility study that evaluates ACT group therapy delivered by a clinical psychologist in comparison to an unstructured support group delivered by a psychology graduate with no training in XX, in people who are 15-18 months post-bariatric surgery. There are some significant challenges in feasibility discovered in terms of intervention uptake and retention and the authors are transparent about this. However, there are some issues with the analysis and reporting of the study that should be improved prior to publication.</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>The introduction needs revision – specifically in terms of the review of previous research on ACT for weight management. For example, the authors introduce ACT by stating that “Third wave cognitive behavioural therapies ….. are evidenced in the general population.14 , 15. What do the authors mean by “evidenced in the general population”? The two papers they cite are a (now out of date) review of mindfulness-based interventions by O'Reilly et al and a small trial of people with overweight and obesity from 2009 by Forman et al. The authors should more fully describe the literature to date in people with overweight and obesity. More recent and comprehensive systematic reviews have been conducted (e.g. Lawlor et al 2020), as have larger trials with longer term follow up. (eg Formal et al 2019 doi: 10.1002/oby.22412.)</p>
              <p>The authors then cite a very small Iranian study in people with obesity. Is the point that the authors are trying to make that this is the only study in people with obesity? I suggest that this is not correct and that the authors should describe all relevant literature in people with obesity.</p>
              <p>A more comprehensive review of literature to date for post bariatric surgery should then be reported. How does this study differ from the previous literature and what gap does it seek to fill?</p>
              <p>The discussion should end with the aims of the study, rather than a summary of the rest of the paper.</p>
              <p>The authors should also be careful to avoid self-plagiarism of their protocol paper <ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2349-3259.ijct20194655" ext-link-type="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2349-3259.ijct20194655</ext-link></p>
              <p>Minor point - Person first language would mean not using overweight as something people “are”. I appreciate that some people find “people with obesity” to be grammatically difficult. Given that the real focus here is on obesity, I would simply remove the stats on overweight.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>The methods are largely well described, and deviations from the protocol are highlighted.</p>
              <p>I did not understand the justification for the intervention costings. It states that : There were no extra hours or treatment costs because the ACT group was led by a Band 7 psychologist as part of their regular duties. However, the control group did not receive care from a Band 7 psychologist whereas the support group was led by A Band 4 psychology graduate with no formal therapy training. The cost difference here would be substantial. It appears later in the results that these different costs are taken into account, so perhaps this section just needs rephrasing to be much clearer.</p>
              <p>Minor – It states that Loss to follow up and group attrition were recorded in a consort diagram (Figure 1). I suspect that they were recorded somewhere else. They are presenting in the diagram.</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>Large number of patients were screened as eligible but chose not to take part (with a substantial number unable to commit to the treatment sessions.</p>
              <p>While I appreciate the granularity of Table 2, this makes it very difficult to follow. It would be more meaningful to present the number of all ACT and all SGT participants attending each session.</p>
              <p>The authors include the following paragraph in the results “The decision regarding the best primary and secondary outcome measures for a full RCT would require the careful consideration of many aspects of the proposed trial, including consensus in the most relevant patient-centred outcome to demonstrate efficacy. The data collected during this feasibility study for a range of outcomes would be sufficient to inform the necessary sample size calculations for a future trial through estimates of standard deviation of the chosen outcome.” This should be moved to the discussion and the authors should be specific about HOW the current study is informative – what decisions does it help make? Can the authors design a trial based on this data? If so, what does this trial look like. If not, what further studies are needed to inform a trial?</p>
              <p>The original intention in the protocol was to use inductive thematic analysis. The authors say that they used the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) instead. They describe this as an “evidence-based” method. However, the TFA is not a method for qualitative data analysis. It is a framework for defining acceptability. How was the analysis conducted?</p>
              <p>Tables 3 and 4 appear to be trying to quantify qualitative data and do not ad value to the paper. The way coding is described also suggests a very un-qualitative approach. It appears that they just “coded” each time something was said that was relevant to pre-determined codes and the results simply repeats “one person said this, two people said Y” with little to no attempt to interpret or synthesise the data. Phrases like “X was coded most frequently” suggest that this was not a qualitative analysis, but rather a labelling exercise. The qualitative analysis should be revisited and an appropriate method used and described.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>I suspect that the discussion will change following reanalysis of the qualitative data using appropriate qualitative methods. The discussion should be edited to be clearer where there are findings from this study and where the authors are referring to findings from the general literature. Ideally, we should be able to discern the novel contribution of this study.</p>
              <p>The strengths and limitations of the study should be clearly discussed</p>

              <p>Reviewer comments: </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors reported about the results of a randomized controlled feasibility trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of ACT following bariatric surgery a randomized controlled trial of 10 sessions of group ACT or Usual Care Support Group control (SGC) was delivered 15- 18 months post bariatric surgery they concluded, that the trial processes were feasible, but that the ACT intervention was not acceptable as delivered. Our data suggest changes to recruitment and intervention delivery that would address this.</p>
              <p>First of all I would like to congratulate the authors for providing and consistently reporting this feasibility study. I do have some minor comments to the presentation, which could be easily addressed in a review.</p>
              <p>Author Response: We thank this reviewer for their thoughtful comments. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The appropriate guideline is the "CONSORT statement on Pilot and Feasibility Trials (see BMJ 2016; 355:i5239 <ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj" ext-link-type="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj</ext-link>. i5239)". Please use this checklist, although the difference appears to be minor. The extra statement on page 6 might not be necessary.</p>
              <p>Author Response: Thank you this version has now been used (S1)</p>
              <p>p5: Is it possible to give a variable, by which "Acceptability of the ACT group therapy" is assessed.</p>
              <p>Author Response: we have now added “Acceptability of the intervention was assessed as group attendance and through interview data.”</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: p7 Randomization. Please give more details, e.g. the randomization procedure, software (R software package) and how the random allocation was implemented. Please give more details with respect to blinding. Single blinding is not very specific. How is blinding implemented.</p>
              <p>Author Response: Thank you, we have now added details to P7 under ‘randomization’</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: P7 I fully understand, that a strong sample size argument could not be given here. But when the primary endpoint is specified, a precision argument for estimation could be given - even post hoc - to illustrate the argument.</p>
              <p>Author Response: Thank you we have now noted the precision using confidence intervals of the main feasibility outcomes and added an illustrative post-hoc argument to justify the sample size.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: p8. Please include a table with the descriptive measures of the secondary outcome scores.</p>
              <p>Author Response: Thank you for this, all this information can be found in the Supplementary materials.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: P10 or elsewhere: Could you derive some recommendation about the trails primary endpoint variable. Could you derive some ideas about the minimal detectable difference, i.e. the minimal difference to be detected resulting in a change of patient care?</p>
              <p>Author Response: We have moved the comments about the primary endpoint from the results section to the discussion section (as requested by reviewer 2), and added some additional comments. The study was not designed to detect minimal detectable differences for validated outcomes, but sufficient data exists to support a sample size calculation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: p11: Please skip the p-values You may argue from the estimates of the difference and CI'S from the multilevel models. Rosenberger WF, Lachin JM. (2015) Randomization in Clinical Trials, Second Edition. Wiley, New York. DOI:10.1002/9781118742112</p>
              <p>Author Response: Within the manuscript, the p-values have now been removed and replaced by estimated differences and confidence intervals as suggested.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: In general, p-values should be given with at least 3 decimal digits to avoid misinterpretation.</p>
              <p>Author Response: please see above response</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: As the manuscript title states, this study addresses a critical need. Namely, the provision of psychological care to support weight management post-bariatric surgery. This is a well designed feasibility study that evaluates ACT group therapy delivered by a clinical psychologist in comparison to an unstructured support group delivered by a psychology graduate with no training in XX, in people who are 15-18 months post-bariatric surgery. There are some significant challenges in feasibility discovered in terms of intervention uptake and retention and the authors are transparent about this. However, there are some issues with the analysis and reporting of the study that should be improved prior to publication.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Introduction</p>
              <p>The introduction needs revision – specifically in terms of the review of previous research on ACT for weight management. For example, the authors introduce ACT by stating that “Third wave cognitive behavioural therapies ….. are evidenced in the general population.14 , 15. What do the authors mean by “evidenced in the general population”? The two papers they cite are a (now out of date) review of mindfulness-based interventions by O'Reilly et al and a small trial of people with overweight and obesity from 2009 by Forman et al. The authors should more fully describe the literature to date in people with overweight and obesity. More recent and comprehensive systematic reviews have been conducted (e.g. Lawlor et al 2020), as have larger trials with longer term follow up. (eg Formal et al 2019 doi: 10.1002/oby.22412.)</p>
              <p>The authors then cite a very small Iranian study in people with obesity. Is the point that the authors are trying to make that this is the only study in people with obesity? I suggest that this is not correct and that the authors should describe all relevant literature in people with obesity.</p>
              <p>A more comprehensive review of literature to date for post bariatric surgery should then be reported. How does this study differ from the previous literature and what gap does it seek to fill?</p>
              <p>Author Response: We have now removed those references, updated the background section and made clearer what this study adds. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The discussion should end with the aims of the study, rather than a summary of the rest of the paper.</p>
              <p>Author Response: thank you, we have now changed this.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors should also be careful to avoid self-plagiarism of their protocol paper <ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2349-3259.ijct20194655" ext-link-type="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2349-3259.ijct20194655</ext-link></p>
              <p>Author Response: thank you, we have reviewed the paper for self-plagarism</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Minor point - Person first language would mean not using overweight as something people “are”. I appreciate that some people find “people with obesity” to be grammatically difficult. Given that the real focus here is on obesity, I would simply remove the stats on overweight.</p>
              <p>Author Response: we have removed the stats on overweight and used the term people living with obesity throughout. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Methods</p>
              <p>The methods are largely well described, and deviations from the protocol are highlighted.</p>
              <p>I did not understand the justification for the intervention costings. It states that : There were no extra hours or treatment costs because the ACT group was led by a Band 7 psychologist as part of their regular duties. However, the control group did not receive care from a Band 7 psychologist whereas the support group was led by A Band 4 psychology graduate with no formal therapy training. The cost difference here would be substantial. It appears later in the results that these different costs are taken into account, so perhaps this section just needs rephrasing to be much clearer.</p>
              <p>Author Response: thank you, we have removed reference to no extra hours/treatment costs as we agree this was confusing.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Minor – It states that Loss to follow up and group attrition were recorded in a consort diagram (Figure 1). I suspect that they were recorded somewhere else. They are presenting in the diagram.</p>
              <p>Author Response: thank you, we have corrected our language accordingly.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Results</p>
              <p>Large number of patients were screened as eligible but chose not to take part (with a substantial number unable to commit to the treatment sessions.</p>
              <p>While I appreciate the granularity of Table 2, this makes it very difficult to follow. It would be more meaningful to present the number of all ACT and all SGT participants attending each session.</p>
              <p>Author Response: we have now changed Table 2 accordingly and agree that it is clearer.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors include the following paragraph in the results “The decision regarding the best primary and secondary outcome measures for a full RCT would require the careful consideration of many aspects of the proposed trial, including consensus in the most relevant patient-centred outcome to demonstrate efficacy. The data collected during this feasibility study for a range of outcomes would be sufficient to inform the necessary sample size calculations for a future trial through estimates of standard deviation of the chosen outcome.” This should be moved to the discussion and the authors should be specific about HOW the current study is informative – what decisions does it help make? Can the authors design a trial based on this data? If so, what does this trial look like. If not, what further studies are needed to inform a trial?</p>
              <p>Author Response: We have moved the comments about the primary endpoint from the results section to the discussion section as requested and improved the discussion. The study was not designed to detect minimal detectable differences for validated outcomes, but sufficient data exists to support a sample size calculation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The original intention in the protocol was to use inductive thematic analysis. The authors say that they used the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) instead. They describe this as an “evidence-based” method. However, the TFA is not a method for qualitative data analysis. It is a framework for defining acceptability. How was the analysis conducted?</p>
              <p>Tables 3 and 4 appear to be trying to quantify qualitative data and do not ad value to the paper. The way coding is described also suggests a very un-qualitative approach. It appears that they just “coded” each time something was said that was relevant to pre-determined codes and the results simply repeats “one person said this, two people said Y” with little to no attempt to interpret or synthesise the data. Phrases like “X was coded most frequently” suggest that this was not a qualitative analysis, but rather a labelling exercise. The qualitative analysis should be revisited and an appropriate method used and described.</p>
              <p>Author Response: thank you for this. it appears that in trying to be concise we left out important information. We have now explained and referenced our methods in more detail, cut tables 3&amp;4 and incorporated quotes into the text.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>I suspect that the discussion will change following reanalysis of the qualitative data using appropriate qualitative methods. The discussion should be edited to be clearer where there are findings from this study and where the authors are referring to findings from the general literature. Ideally, we should be able to discern the novel contribution of this study.</p>
              <p>The strengths and limitations of the study should be clearly discussed</p>
              <p>Author Response: We have now changed the discussion and addressed these issues and hope that it is now clearer.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have done a reasonable job of responding to my earlier comments.</p>
              <p>The qualitative analysis is still a little thin, but I think that is the nature of the data collected and is unlikely to improve.</p>
              <p>Some further minor edits are suggested prior to publication</p>

              <p>Katrien Janin</p>
              <p>Staff Editor</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr Janin</p>
              <p>Thank you for your email. We have now revised the manuscript in accordance with the new minor points that Reviewer 2 has made in their second review. The changes are listed below. </p>
              <p>We hope that the manuscript is now acceptable for publication. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Author response: we thank Reviewer 1 for their positive review.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have done a reasonable job of responding to my earlier comments.</p>
              <p>The qualitative analysis is still a little thin, but I think that is the nature of the data collected and is unlikely to improve.</p>
              <p>Author response: we thank Reviewer 2 for their very detailed reviews. We agree with the above comment. </p>
              <p>Reviewer 2: Some further minor edits are suggested prior to publication</p>
              <p>The following sentence does not make sense: Patients who expressed suicidal ideation (score &gt;0 on 125 Q9, PHQ-9) or at psychiatry assessment [26], were unable to communicate in English or to commit to 126 attendance were excluded.</p>
              <p>Author Response: Thank you, we have restructured the sentence accordingly: “Patients who expressed suicidal ideation (score &gt;0 on Q9 of the PHQ-9 [26] or at psychiatry assessment), or who were unable to communicate in English, or who were unable to commit to attendance were excluded.”</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2: the cost consequence method is not well described. What was included in the analysis? How was this done?</p>
              <p>Author Response: The requested detail has now been added with references (p11)</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2: It is not clear how the ACT group was associated with a 0.07 QALY reduction in mean incremental QALY if mean QALYs accrued from baseline to 12 month 346 follow-up were: ACT (n=13) = 0.61 SD 0.26; SGC (n=19) = 0.59 SD 0.37.</p>
              <p>Author Response: this as now been clarified (p18-19)</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2: The authors comment that data collection was feasible and acceptable, but less than 50% completed 12 month data collection. Tis suggests problems with data collection and trial retention.</p>
              <p>Author Response: it is unclear to where in the manuscript the reviewer is referring, we have been clear about trial retention issues throughout, we have now adapted the following existing sentence (p25) to emphasise the point: “It appeared that although data collection was hampered by lack of retention, other trial processes (i.e. recruitment, consent, data collection in those retained in the trial) would be feasible for a future trial but that the intervention, as delivered, may not be.”</p>
              <p>Editor comment: Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article’s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>
              <p>Author Response: 3 references have now been added to support the additional information requested about the cost-consequence analysis:</p>
