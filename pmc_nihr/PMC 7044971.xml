                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Patients with multiple chronic health conditions are often managed in a disjointed fashion in primary care, with annual review clinic appointments offered separately for each condition. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the 3D intervention, which was developed to improve the system of care.</p>

                  <p>797 adults with three or more chronic conditions were randomised to the 3D intervention, while 749 participants were randomised to receive usual care.</p>

                  <title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title>
                  <p>The primary economic evaluation assessed the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS). Costs were related to changes in a range of secondary outcomes (QALYs accrued by both participants and carers, and deaths) in a cost–consequences analysis from the perspectives of the NHS/PSS, patients/carers and productivity losses.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Very small increases were found in both QALYs (adjusted mean difference 0.007 (−0.009 to 0.023)) and costs (adjusted mean difference £126 (£−739 to £991)) in the intervention arm compared with usual care after 15 months. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £18 499, with a 50.8% chance of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY (55.8% at £30 000 per QALY).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The small differences in costs and outcomes were consistent with chance, and the uncertainty was substantial; therefore, the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of the 3D approach from the NHS/PSS perspective should be considered equivocal.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The number of patients living with multiple chronic health conditions (multimorbidity) is increasing in developed countries as the population ages.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Multimorbidity is associated with poor health-related quality of life,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> higher use of health services and higher costs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Multimorbidity is common for older adults (with a prevalence of up to 98%),<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> leading to a substantial economic burden.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Care pathways for patients with multimorbidity are often poorly coordinated and burdensome for patients. Each condition may be treated separately, which fails to take account of interactions between diseases.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> There have been relatively few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions designed to address issues affecting multimorbid patients, with mixed findings leading to substantial uncertainty about the effectiveness of such interventions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of interventions remains even more limited and the evidence that is available is inconsistent.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> A recent review of comprehensive care programmes for multimorbidity found no evidence that such interventions reduce healthcare costs or primary care visits.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Several reviews have highlighted the need for research on new interventions, including assessment of cost-effectiveness.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 7 11</xref> The inconsistency in the evidence for cost-effectiveness provided a clear indication that a large, well-conducted trial with an integral economic evaluation needed to be carried out.</p>
              <p>The ‘3D’ intervention was developed to address the issues associated with managing patients with multimorbidity in primary care in the UK. The intervention was based on a patient-centred care model and aimed to improve continuity of care with caregivers in general practitioner (GP) surgeries, reduce patient burden in accessing healthcare and increase patient involvement in decision-making about their care (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>). Based on the seminal work of Stewart,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> the concept of patient-centred care includes a focus on the patient’s individual illness experience, an integrated biopsychosocial perspective, seeking to find common ground with the patient and agreeing management plans and enhancing a continuing relationship between the patient and doctor. We sought to apply these principles within the 3D intervention. The 3D randomised trial assessed the effectiveness of the 3D approach compared with usual care, and incorporated an embedded process evaluation. The trial did not find any differences in health-related quality of life over 15 months of follow-up, but the intervention did lead to improved patient-centred care.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Here, we report the results of the economic evaluation conducted alongside the 3D trial.</p>

                <p>Full details of the study design, eligibility criteria, recruitment process and clinical effectiveness results are given elsewhere.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> All patients and practices gave written informed consent to participate in the study. In brief, the pragmatical 3D cluster randomised trial compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a complex intervention for multimorbidity with usual care delivered in 33 general practices in Scotland and England. The target patients were adults with multimorbidity, defined as having three or more chronic conditions from those included in the National Health Service (NHS) Quality and Outcomes Framework.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Clinical staff in intervention practices attended two half-day 3D training sessions. Participants in the intervention arm were offered 6-monthly holistic reviews of their health problems. Each review consisted of a nurse review appointment to collect relevant clinical information, a medication review conducted by a pharmacist and an extended appointment for the patient to discuss their conditions with a named GP. An individual health plan was negotiated with patients, detailing their own priorities for managing their conditions. The primary outcome measure for effectiveness was health-related quality of life at 15 months after randomisation, measured using the EQ-5D-5L.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
                <p>The primary economic cost–utility analysis was conducted from the NHS and personal social services (PSS) perspective over 15 months of follow-up. A secondary analysis was conducted from the perspective of patients and carers.</p>

                  <title>Outcome measurement</title>
                  <p>The primary economic outcome measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). EQ-5D-5L measurements were collected by postal questionnaires at baseline, 9 months and 15 months post-recruitment, supplemented by telephone collection for non-responders. Utility scores based on a UK population were derived from responses to the EQ-5D-5L cross-mapped to valuations obtained for the EQ-5D-3L instrument.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This was a change (approved by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee) to the analysis originally planned, as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued a position statement recommending this approach<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> subsequent to the design of the study but prior to analysis. QALYs over the 15-month period were formed from these valuations by means of linear interpolation and an area under the curve calculation. Patients who died during follow-up were treated as if their most recent utility score was relevant until death, and set to zero immediately at death. Carers also completed the EQ-5D-5L instrument at the same timepoints as patients.</p>

                  <title>Resource-use measurement</title>
                  <p>As the trial population had multimorbidity, resource use related to any health condition experienced by the participant was considered relevant.</p>
                  <p>Staff training attendance records were kept to track resources used to deliver the training programmes for GPs, nurses and receptionists, including trainee and trainer delivery time (and preparation time), travel costs and course materials. 3D GP appointments, nurse appointments and pharmacist reviews were captured by downloading routine GP records, supplemented by manual data capture by researchers reviewing participants’ medical records at the end of the trial.</p>
                  <p>Data on medications prescribed and tests/investigations in primary care were extracted from downloads of routine GP records. Details of the number and duration of primary care consultations (other than 3D reviews) were similarly extracted. These included face-to-face, telephone and home consultations with doctors, nurses or healthcare assistants based in general practice. Duration details were not available for practices in Scotland. Therefore, an average duration for each type of consultation by each staff type in each arm was derived using available data (practices in England only) and applied to all relevant consultations. The research team collected NHS secondary care data from participants’ GP records.</p>
                  <p>To assess travel costs, the patient’s normal transport method for GP appointments and the cost (for public transport) or mileage (for private transport) were collected in the patient-reported questionnaire at baseline, along with usual practice with regards to time off work, and details of whether the participant paid prescription charges or not. NHS community care, care from social services, time off work for patients and carers to attend hospital appointments and over-the-counter medication expenditure were captured in the patient-reported questionnaires at 9 and 15 months, as were private use of treatments and therapies.</p>

                <p>A cost–utility analysis was conducted from the NHS/PSS perspective corresponding to the NICE reference case.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The incremental mean difference in QALYs between the two arms of the trial and 95% CIs were derived. Overall mean NHS/PSS costs, and SEs for both arms of the trial were calculated. The incremental mean difference in total costs between the two arms of the trial and 95% CIs were estimated.</p>
                <p>Cost and QALY data were combined to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefit (NMB) statistic<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> from the NHS/PSS perspective. In the primary analysis we estimated whether the 3D approach was cost-effective at the established NICE thresholds of £20 000 and £30 000 per QALY gained. The probability that the 3D approach was cost-effective at various societal 'willingness to pay for a QALY' thresholds was depicted using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). All measures of cost-effectiveness (ICER, CEAC and NMB) and CIs were derived parametrically using the output of seemingly-unrelated regression analysis to account for the correlation between costs and outcomes, and controlling for baseline imbalance in utility for the QALY equation<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Clustering within GP practices was accounted for by including the randomisation variables in the regression.</p>
                <p>As the broader societal perspective also has relevance, the costs of each component of the intervention were estimated separately from the NHS/PSS perspective (ie, including all resources supplied by the healthcare provider), the patient/carer perspective (ie, including all costs borne by the participants themselves) and the productivity perspective (ie, taking into account time off work) and related to changes in a range of secondary outcomes in a cost–consequences analysis.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Consequences included QALYs accrued by both participants and carers, and deaths. The cost–consequences analysis was based on available cases, which differed in number for each type of healthcare resource or outcome; an available case was defined as an individual having complete data for each relevant timepoint. Linear regression output was used to derive CIs parametrically, accounting for clustering within practices.</p>

                <p>Sixteen practices (797 participants) were randomised to be offered the 3D approach, while 17 practices (749 participants) were randomised to receive usual care. Missing data occurred for a number of reasons, including withdrawal from the trial, or leaving the practice. Twelve participants (1.5%) in the 3D arm and six (0.8%) in the control arm had no information on secondary care use because it was not possible to locate their medical records (p=0.2). Practice downloads of medication and investigation data failed for 18 participants (2.3%) in the intervention arm and eight (1.1%) in the usual care arm (p=0.07), while 19 (2.4%) and 10 (1.3%) 3D and usual care participants, respectively, were missing consultation data from practice downloads (p=0.13). Not all participants returned all questionnaires at all timepoints. 165 participants (20.7%) in the intervention arm and 125 (16.7%) in the control arm did not return a questionnaire at one or more follow-up points (p=0.04). Not all those who did return questionnaires completed the resource-use questions; in total, 181 (22.7%) in the intervention arm and 146 (19.5%) in the control arm were missing resource-use data from questionnaires at one or more follow-up points (p=0.12). Complete data sets were available for 1191 participants in total (599 (75.2%) in the 3D arm and 592 (79%) in the control arm, p=0.07). Participants with missing data were in a significantly poorer health state at baseline (mean (95% CI) EQ-5D-5L score: 0.453 (0.422 to 0.485)) than participants with full data sets (mean (95% CI) EQ-5D-5L score: 0.589 (0.574 to 0.605)).</p>

Total costs per patient from the NHS/PSS perspective were £126 (95% CI: -£739 to £991) higher in the intervention arm than in the usual care arm.

A sensitivity analysis excluding participants who died suggested that the probability of cost-effectiveness of the 3D approach at £20 000 was 0.561. A further sensitivity analysis using undiscounted costs and outcomes did not suggest that the discount rate affected the conclusions.</p>

                <p>No significant difference was observed between participants offered the 3D intervention and those receiving usual care only for overall costs, resource use of any category or QALY outcomes. The participants were substantial users of healthcare, with inpatient hospital care and medications both high contributors to overall costs. A small improvement in outcome (representing an additional 2.6 days of the best imaginable health over 15 months) coupled with a small increase in costs between arms led to weak evidence for the cost-effectiveness of the 3D approach in the primary analysis from the NHS/PSS perspective. The net monetary benefit was small, but positive, indicating that society is willing to pay for the benefits that can be achieved.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This economic evaluation was conducted alongside a large and rigorous RCT. Meticulous data collection practices allowed individual patient data to be measured for all the key cost drivers, a particularly challenging task for a patient group that has high healthcare usage. The study contributes to the body of evidence supporting the care of patients with multimorbidity. Patterns of missing resource-use data were similar between arms, and high questionnaire return rates were achieved<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>; however, the recall period for resource-use was quite long at 9 months, which may have led to patients omitting to include some resources. Medication costs were based on prescriptions issued by the GP, and it is not certain that all scripts were filled by the participant; the medication costs may, therefore, be overestimated. Although the medication data were checked carefully, the volume of medications prescribed to the 3D population rendered it infeasible to check every entry and some errors may have persisted.</p>
                <p>Use of care homes, which can be a significant contributor to costs of social care, was not included in the economic evaluation. The funding of care homes within the UK is complex, with patients often paying considerable amounts themselves. However, only 13 participants reported living in a care home and this did not differ by arm. The follow-up period of the 3D trial was 15 months, and longer-term outcomes are unknown; a follow-up period of 2 to 3 years might have allowed an effect on quality of life or healthcare resource use to be observed. Use of simple mean imputation methods for estimating missing information (such as the cost of a bus fare) in the questionnaire data will have reduced SEs and underestimated the uncertainty around these costs.</p>

                <title>Comparison with other studies</title>
                <p>Comparison with other studies is hampered by the variety of definitions used for multimorbidity, and by the heterogeneity in study designs.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Evidence concerning the cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to manage patients with multimorbidity is limited; only two of the RCTs identified in the review by Smith <italic>et al</italic> undertook cost-effectiveness analyses.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Katon <italic>et al</italic> reported that implementation of a collaborative care intervention for patients with depression alongside either diabetes or coronary heart disease was justified on cost-effectiveness grounds.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, the authors estimated QALYs based on clinical outcomes rather than by direct measurement, and there was substantial uncertainty around both costs and outcomes. Barley <italic>et al</italic> found that a nurse-led patient-centred intervention was cost-effective up to a willingness-to-pay threshold of approximately £3000 per QALY; however, the study was only a pilot RCT, and multimorbidity was defined to include patients with coronary heart disease and depression only.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In a feasibility trial, Mercer <italic>et al</italic> found that a whole-system intervention designed for patients with two or more chronic conditions in deprived areas may be considered cost-effective.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> There is a clear need for further well conducted studies on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for multimorbid patients.</p>

                <title>Implications of study</title>
                <p>This is the largest trial of an intervention for multimorbidity ever undertaken; however, there remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the results. The impact of organisational changes in delivery of primary healthcare on patients’ quality of life is usually very small and the costs are also usually low, but skewed by a small number of patients with high costs in secondary care often unrelated to the intervention. This leads to wide CIs that cross zero (ie, substantial uncertainty) for estimates of cost-effectiveness and illustrates the difficulty of obtaining precise estimates for the economic outcomes of this type of intervention even in large trials.</p>
                <p>The 3D participants had a mean(SD) utility of 0.558 (0.287) at entry to the study, which compares poorly to a UK population mean of 0.779 for ages 65 to 74<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. Participants had a small positive increase in QALYs in the intervention arm, while carers had a small decrease in QALYs compared with the usual care arm; it is possible that an analysis taking carer outcomes into account might reach a different conclusion. The small contribution to overall costs made by productivity losses is consistent with the predominantly retired study population; at baseline, over 65% of participants described themselves as ‘fully retired from work’.</p>
                <p>Anticipated reductions in appointment attendances were not achieved, partly because some patients attended 3D reviews in addition to, rather than instead of, their single-condition reviews. Similarly, although cost savings could have been achieved through a reduction in prescriptions issued, this was not observed in the trial; although the brief was to seek to simplify patients’ medication regimes, the embedded process evaluation<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> suggested that pharmacists appeared to concentrate on adherence to guidelines rather than whether the patient might benefit from stopping some medications. There was substantial variation between practices in the extent to which they implemented the intervention and this may have contributed to variation in costs in the trial arm. Three practices barely implemented the intervention at all because of practice or staffing problems unconnected with the intervention, and this will have diluted the potential effects of the intervention overall. It is possible that the cost-effectiveness of the intervention could be increased by focusing more on patients with the greatest needs, by more attention to de-prescribing and by ending unnecessary additional disease-specific reviews as the 3D model became normalised.</p>

                <title>Future work</title>
                <p>The EQ-5D instrument was used because it is recommended by NICE in the UK,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and there was little evidence on alternatives at the trial outset. However, it is difficult to pick up small changes in health-related quality of life arising from service reconfigurations, and it may be that a measure capturing outcomes beyond health would be more appropriate. In future work, researchers should consider including alternative economic outcome measures alongside the EQ-5D; for example, the ICECAP suite of capability well-being instruments.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The effect of the intervention on carers is being considered further, and it would be interesting to explore the reasons for the errors observed in the medication records downloaded from GP practice systems.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The evidence for the cost-effectiveness of the 3D intervention is equivocal; the results suggest that there is just over a 50% chance of cost-effectiveness at the established threshold of £20 000 per QALY from the NHS/PSS perspective. The small differences in costs and outcomes are consistent with chance, and the uncertainty is substantial; therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. Given the equivocal nature of the cost-effectiveness results, implementation of the intervention cannot be recommended on economic grounds alone.</p>
