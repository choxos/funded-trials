                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Thermal ablation techniques have become the first-line treatment of truncal veins in the management of chronic venous disease (CVD). Despite excellent outcomes, these methods are often associated with pain; generally due to their use of heat and the necessity of fluid infiltration around the vein. More recently, novel non-thermal techniques, such as mechanochemical ablation (MOCA) and cyanoacrylate adhesive (CAE) have been developed to overcome these unwelcome effects. So far, the novel techniques have been found to have similar efficacy to thermal methods, yet no direct comparisons between the non-thermal treatment techniques have been conducted to date, giving rise to this study.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This is a prospective, multicentre, randomised clinical trial, recruiting patients with truncal saphenous incompetence. Patients will be randomised to undergo either MOCA or CAE truncal ablation, followed by treatment of any varicosities. All patients will be required to wear compression stockings for 4 days post intervention. The primary outcome measure is the pain score immediately following completion of truncal ablation, measured by a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes are entire treatment pain scores, clinical scores, quality of life scores, occlusion rates, time to return to usual activities/work at 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months. Re-intervention rate will be considered from the third month. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed for each intervention at 12 months. The study is powered to detect a mean 10-mm difference in maximum pain score. Allowing for loss to follow-up, the total target recruitment is 180 patients.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par29">Varicose veins are common and are known to affect approximately one third of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Chronic venous disease (CVD) has been demonstrated to have a negative impact on the quality of life (QoL) of patients and treatment of varicose veins has been demonstrated to lead to improvement in the QoL of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Over the past decade, new endovenous techniques have been introduced, and these are felt to be cost-effective, especially when performed in an outpatient or ‘office-based’ setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These endovenous ablation methods (almost exclusively radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)) employ mainly thermal energy to treat varicose veins. The American Venous Forum (AVF) and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in July 2013 recommended the use of endovenous thermal ablation techniques, namely radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), as first-line treatment for truncal reflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Occlusion rates of greater than 90% have been demonstrated in studies looking at these two methods at up to 5 years of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">However, because these methods make use of thermal energy to denature the venous wall, they have the potential to cause pain, skin burns, skin pigmentation, nerve damage and even arteriovenous fistula formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To minimise these possible complications and to allow effective treatment, tumescent anaesthesia must be infiltrated around the vein to be treated. This, in turn, can be a source of discomfort to patients.</p>
              <p id="Par31">More recently, newer non-thermal, non-tumescent ablation techniques (NTNTs) have been introduced in an attempt to reduce these complications. Mechanochemical ablation (MOCA) and cyanoacrylate adhesive injection (CAE) are two examples of these NTNTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. So far, pain has been shown to be less than [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], or comparable to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], thermal methods, but also equivalent to them in terms of QoL improvement, time to return to normal activities and occlusion rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This indicates that they may, one day, be considered favourable to endothermal ablation.</p>
              <p id="Par32">NICE has also recently produced interventional procedure guidance for the use of both MOCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and CAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">To date, there has not been a direct head-to-head comparison of these two non-thermal methods. We, propose to undertake a randomised controlled study comparing MOCA and CAE in the treatment of varicose veins.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par34">The main aim of this study is to detect which method causes less pain. Secondary objectives are to assess the pain level over the ensuing few days, change in QoL, clinical severity score, degree of bruising and inflammation, time to return to normal activities/work, re-intervention rates as well as the cost-effectiveness of each method.</p>

                <p id="Par39">For both methods, the truncal vein (GSV or SSV) is cannulated under ultrasound guidance using the Seldinger technique after injection of local anaesthetic (1% lidocaine). The catheter-wire tip is placed 5 cm for the CAE group or 2 cm for the MOCA group distal to the sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) or sapheno-popliteal junction (SPJ). Cannulation is obtained at the most distal point of venous reflux.</p>
                <p id="Par40">All patients are treated with the ClariVein® mechanochemical ablation device (Vascular Insights, Madison, CT, USA), or the VenaSeal™ Closure System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The methods used for MOCA and for CAE are described in detail by van Eekeren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and by Almeida et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], respectively.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Following all procedures, an ultrasound scan is performed to assess both the treated truncal vein and the deep veins. Concomitant phlebectomy or foam sclerotherapy will then be carried out if deemed necessary and clinically indicated by the clinical team.</p>
                <p id="Par42">The duration of the procedure is defined as from the time of insertion of the cannula into the vein to the time of removal the catheter. The total volume of liquid sclerosant, the amount of proprietary cyanoacrylate glue and the length of the treated vein are recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Re-intervention of the treated saphenous veins will not be considered until at least 3 months after the initial procedure.</p>

                <p id="Par55">The study is designed to assess for equivalence. Based on previous studies, 10 mm is a clinically appropriate minimum important difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We estimated the sample size needed to observe a mean difference of at least 10 mm (standard deviation: 20 mm) between the two interventions. With power set at 80% and 5% significance equivalence, we need to recruit 128 patients (64 patients per group). If a dropout rate from follow-up of 30% is estimated, the total number to recruit is 183. If at least three patients are recruited per week, 156 patients could potentially be randomised over 1 year, and 180 patients over 60 weeks (approximately 14 months). Thus, with 12-month follow-up the study will run for 26 months with a target recruitment of 180 patients.</p>

              <p id="Par87">Varicose veins are a very common condition associated with detrimental effects on the QoL of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It has been proven that their management leads to improvement in QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recently, the newer techniques of MOCA and CAE have been introduced and do not require tumescent anaesthesia or the use of thermal energy. This has led to a reduction in patient discomfort, hematoma formation, and risk of a nerve injury when compared to thermal-based procedures.</p>
              <p id="Par88">The results, so far, of these new techniques have shown to be effective and safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; however, there is little data regarding their efficiency and durability.</p>
              <p id="Par89">Therefore, we have designed this multicentre randomised controlled trial to ascertain which one of these techniques causes less pain. To our knowledge, this is the first trial making the direct comparison between MOCA and CAE.</p>
              <p id="Par90">The aims of this current trial are firstly to compare the pain score between MOCA versus CAE and, secondly, to assess the pain level over the ensuing few days, change in the QoL, VCSS, degree of bruising and inflammation, time to return to normal activities/work, re-intervention rates and cost-effectiveness of each method.</p>
              <p id="Par91">The trial will be conducted across two very different healthcare systems in the UK and Singapore, broadening the population base, characteristics and application of findings.</p>

The co-investigators at each recruiting canter will obtain written consent from all participants. The right of the participant to refuse to participate without giving reasons will be respected. After the participant has entered the study, the clinician remains free to give alternative treatment to that specified in the protocol at any stage if they feel that it is in the participant’s best interest, but the reasons for doing so will be recorded. In these cases, the participants remain within the study for the purposes of follow-up and data analysis. All participants are free to withdraw at any time from the protocol treatment without giving reasons and without prejudicing further treatment.</p>
