                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>The Getting Recovery Right After Neck Dissection (GRRAND) intervention is a physiotherapy programme for patients with head and neck cancer who have undergone neck dissection. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand if the intervention was useful, acceptable and whether it was feasible to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>This qualitative study was embedded within the GRRAND-Feasibility (GRRAND-F) Study.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>Participants were recruited from four acute National Health Service hospitals in England between 2020 and 2021.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>We interviewed four usual care and four intervention patient-participants from a single study site (Oxford). Six were male, two were female. All were white British ethnicity. We interviewed two physiotherapists from Oxford who delivered the GRRAND-F intervention, and physiotherapists from Birmingham, Poole and Norwich who were trained to deliver the intervention but were not able to deliver it within the study time frame.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The analysis identified five themes: (1) Acceptability, (2) Adherence, (3) Outcomes, (4) Feasibility and (5) Stand-alone themes (prehabilitation, video consultations, healthcare use).</p>
                  <p>Patient-participants and physiotherapist-participants agreed that usual care was not meeting patients’ rehabilitation needs. The GRRAND intervention provided biopsychosocial support. In comparison to the usual care group, patient-participants who received the intervention were more confident that they could perform rehabilitation exercises and were more motivated to engage in long-term adaptive behaviour change. Physiotherapists felt they needed more administrative support to participate in an RCT.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Participants felt that usual care was insufficient. GRRAND provided much needed, biopsychosocial support to patients. Participants were supportive that it would be feasible to test GRRAND in an RCT.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Head and neck cancer (HNC) incidence continues to rise and is anticipated to reach 1.08 million cases annually by 2030.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Survival rates for people living with this condition have also improved.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Consequently, there is a growing population of people living with HNC.</p>
              <p>The clinical presentations of HNC are varied, reflected in a diversity in treatment options and treatment side effects. Treatment can involve surgery or radiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) to the primary site and to the neck. However despite changing treatment paradigms up to 20% of patients with HNC still require a neck dissection (ND) as part of their treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> During the initial five postoperative years, patients may experience a range of side effects on a continuum of severity. The physical health side effects can include problems with swallowing, speech, neck and shoulder function, sleeping, cervical contracture and muscle wastage.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The psychosocial side effects can include prolonged fatigue, depression, anxiety and isolation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Fifty per cent of patients with HNC who have undergone ND cease to work due to their treatment side effects.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Cochrane<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> have highlighted the need for research into developing an intervention to promote recovery post-ND for patients with HNC. The Getting Recovery Right After Neck Dissection (GRRAND) Feasibility Study<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> aimed to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multimodal rehabilitation intervention. Embedded in this feasibility trial, we conducted a qualitative investigation to understand and represent participant and physiotherapist experiences of the GRRAND intervention.</p>
              <p>The aim of this qualitative study was to understand the perspectives of the physiotherapists and patient participants on whether the GRRAND intervention was acceptable and/or perceived as useful and if it was feasible to conduct an RCT. This study has implications beyond physiotherapy following ND as there is increasing research into using personalised treatment approaches which are adapted in response to each patient’s individual needs (adaptive therapy). This study will provide further insight into the barriers and feasibility of such regimes.</p>

                <p>This qualitative study was embedded within the GRRAND-F Study. From 2020 to 2021 participants recruited at the University of Oxford Hospital were randomised 2:1 to either receive the GRRAND intervention or to usual care.</p>

                <title>Interviews</title>
                <p>Semistructured interviews were conducted to enable the interviewer to direct the conversations to answer the study’s research questions while allowing the participants to freely represent their perspectives and introduce novel themes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
                <p>Our Patient and public involvement (PPI) representatives and members of a patient support group (Heads2gether) suggested that some participants might be inhibited to express in a group setting their genuine experiences because there was a large variation in distress and disability. Therefore, we used individual interviews as opposed to focus groups,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in order that we did not inhibit participant disclosure in a focus group.</p>
                <p>We did not conduct any repeat interviews nor did we return the transcripts to participants for member checking because we wanted to avoid overburden on a vulnerable patient group.</p>

                  <title>Semistructured interview procedure and topic guides</title>
                  <p>A health psychology researcher (BF) (PhD, female) with over 10 years of experience designing, conducting and reporting qualitative research, conducted the interviews and analysis. The interviews were intended to be conducted face to face. However due to COVID-19 restrictions, we adapted the procedure and conducted all interviews over Microsoft Teams. Participants who consented to participate in the interviews were contacted by phone by BF to ensure continued consent despite conducting the interviews via videoconference technology. At the beginning of the interview, BF took time to explain to the participants that she was a psychologist who wanted to understand their experience of participating in this feasibility trial (see semi-structured interview (SSI) guide); that she was not a physiotherapist nor a leading member of the trial design team, who might have hopes to prove GRRAND was useful; BF was not aiming to prove one hypothesis or another; and she reiterated that the participant’s data would remain anonymous to all other members of the physiotherapy and research teams.</p>
                  <p>The interviews lasted between 30 min and 60 min. We interviewed all patient participants who had completed 6 months of participation in either the treatment as usual or the GRRAND intervention arm. The interviews were recorded on Microsoft Teams and the audio (mp4) files downloaded. The audio files were uploaded via a secure server to a transcription service and the anonymous transcriptions were returned, via secure server to BF.</p>
                  <p>The semistructured interview topic guide (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) was developed from a scoping review of the qualitative literature of the lived experiences of patients with HNC.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–19</xref> The guide was revised by the GRRAND-F Trial management group which included PPI, surgeon, physiotherapist and psychologist perspectives.</p>

                  <p>Patients with HNC who had undergone ND and consented to be part of the GRRAND-F trial were invited to participate in individual video interviews 6 months after their ND. Our original protocol planned to purposively sample from the broader GRRAND-F participant sample on the basis of sex, ethnicity and trial site. However, due to complications from the COVID-19 lockdown, our trial sample size was greatly reduced. Therefore, we revised our methodology to invite all the patient-participants who had participated in the GRRAND-F Study through a convenience rather than purposive sampling strategy. We invited patient-participants who withdrew from GRRAND-F, but all declined (n=4). All physiotherapists who participated in the trial were invited and agreed to participate in the interviews. All patient-participants and physiotherapist-participants provided informed consent.</p>

                <p>BF began familiarisation with the data while conducting the interviews and recorded reflections and notes after each interview. BF then read the transcriptions of the interviews and began building a preliminary framework of themes with supporting quotations. Preliminary themes were iteratively presented, discussed and refined with the trial management group as part of the analysis process. Deviant themes were identified and either redefined or represented as stand-alone themes. In our final trial management meeting we agreed data saturation had been met.</p>

                  <p>When exploring the acceptability of the GRRAND intervention it was important to recognise the variation of patient-participant experiences. Each patient-participant experienced different physical symptoms with a range of severity (<italic toggle="yes">Quotes 1 and 2</italic>). Some patient-participants reported disabling psychological symptoms (Quotes 3 and 4), and, unhelpful avoidant social coping strategies (<italic toggle="yes">Quotes 5 and 6</italic>).</p>
                  <p>The physiotherapist-participants recognised that the psychosocial distress experienced by these patients is not correlated to the physical symptom type or severity (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 7</italic>).</p>
                  <p>Consequently, we understood that each patient experiences a unique set of physical, psychological and social symptoms and will likely hold varying expectations and need flexibility in their degree of support from the rehabilitation package.</p>
                  <p>The physiotherapist-participants highlighted the unmet psychosocial needs of their patients. They explained how treatment can be very different for each participant due to their variation in symptoms (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 8</italic>).</p>
                  <p>Due to the complexity of this patient population’s symptom presentation, the physiotherapist-participants identified three future training needs in order to deliver GRRAND. One, a specialist HNC ND physiotherapist delivers the training (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 9</italic>). Two, receive more training on how to manage the psychosocial needs of the patient population (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 10</italic>). And, three, develop a communication network across HNC physiotherapists in order to deepen their shared learning (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 11</italic>).</p>

However, some patient-participants felt there was content that was not relevant for them (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 14</italic>).

(2) The use of pacing exercises, a physiotherapist-participant reflected that pacing was already commonly used in their clinical practice (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 17</italic>).

(4) All participants highlighted how the GRRAND intervention sessions were used as emotional support for the patient-participants (<italic toggle="yes">Quotes 20 and 21</italic>). It was also recognised that the physiotherapists could offer empowerment and personal control to patients who were feeling disempowered and overwhelmed (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 22</italic>).</p>

Patient-participants in the intervention group, however, reported more psychological capability that is, they believed they can and they should perform the exercises (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 26</italic>). The usual care group patient-participants reported concerns that they were performing the exercises incorrectly and felt ‘overwhelmed’ to persist with the exercises in isolation (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 27</italic>).</p>

                  <title>Motivation</title>
                  <p>The motivation to perform the physiotherapy exercises appeared more varied across our interview sample. Importantly both members of the intervention group, the usual care group and the physiotherapists felt that regular sessions with a physiotherapist would increase their motivation to adhere to their exercise prescriptions (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 31</italic>). Physiotherapist-participants felt it was very important to tailor the intervention to meet the patient’s individual goals (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 32</italic>).</p>
                  <p>One participant in the intervention group reflected that from discussions with physiotherapists and nurses, he began to understand that his rehabilitation post-ND surgery would be a lifelong process, that symptoms could become worse or new symptoms could arise across his life. He believed that he could integrate his physiotherapy exercise routine into his daily life for a longer-term behaviour change (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 33</italic>). This could be an important information exchange whereby the physiotherapists encourage patients to identify exercises which they could keep doing for the rest of their lives to prevent future disability. This is an important consideration especially in finding daily life physical activities which can target the specific exercises objectives rather than a person having to repeat the same exercises forever.</p>

                <p>Our participants felt that both the usual care and GRRAND intervention helped their rehabilitation (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 34</italic>) and specifically increased their physical functioning (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 35</italic>).</p>
                <p>The main symptom which patient-participants did not feel was helped was their swallowing impairment (<italic toggle="yes">Quotes 36 and 37</italic>). One physiotherapist-participant explained swallowing exercises were covered by the Speech and Language Therapists and not by the physiotherapist (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 38</italic>).</p>
                <p>Patient-participants from the intervention group recognised that their rehabilitation journey was going to be a long-term change to their life (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 39</italic>). However, some patient-participants and physiotherapist-participants recognised that they might not ever regain full function (<italic toggle="yes">Quotes 40 and 41</italic>).</p>

                <title>Theme 4: Stand-alone themes extra to feasibility and acceptability themes</title>
                <p>Some patient-participants and physiotherapist-participants raised the idea of patient receiving support before their ND surgery that is, ‘pre-habilitation’. They suggested patients could receive presurgery counselling to develop patient education regarding the spectrum of symptoms, symptom severity and comorbidities which they could experience (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 42</italic>). One patient-participant explained how he would have liked to have learnt some of the exercises preoperatively so that he could have become accustomed to them and felt prepared for the rehabilitation journey (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 43</italic>). Some physiotherapist-participants reflected on prehabilitation and suggested the information may be necessarily too vague because patients might experience such different symptoms (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 44</italic>). However, they did recognise that becoming accustomed to the exercises could be beneficial (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 45</italic>).</p>
                <p>The use of video consultation was an unforeseen change to our GRRAND-F protocol as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient-participants and physiotherapist-participants reported both the benefits (accessibility) and drawbacks (lack of hands on assessment) of video consultations (<italic toggle="yes">Quotes 46, 47, 48</italic>).</p>
                <p>The overall picture seems to be a desire for a hybrid delivery system, where patients can attend some face-to-face sessions, especially early in their rehabilitation, to achieve experiential learning combined with psychosocial reassurance. Then to have the opportunity to attend some sessions via video consultation, especially for those living further away. This could reduce the number of cancelled sessions and provide a more continuous support structure, which is patient-centred.</p>
                <p>None of the patient-participants had sought any additional private medical care. They sought out information from friends and joined support groups for psychosocial support (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 49</italic>). This suggests their needs were met by the physiotherapy exercises and perhaps the delivery and support structure is an area which we need to target.</p>

                <title>Theme 5: Feasibility</title>
                <p>We received universal agreement among our patient-participants and physiotherapist-participants that this research was needed because <italic toggle="yes">‘the unmet need in this population is so profound’</italic>. Consequently, all were happy to be approached and offered the opportunity to participate (<italic toggle="yes">Quotes 50 and 51</italic>). The physiotherapist-participants shared a concern that they needed further administration support in order to scale up to an RCT (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 52</italic>).</p>

                  <title>Randomisation</title>
                  <p>Some patient-participants understood why the randomisation process allocated them to usual care or intervention. However, some members of the usual care group misinterpreted the reason for their allocation into usual care. One felt they did not ‘qualify’ (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 53</italic>) and another thought it was because he lived further away from the hospital (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 54</italic>).</p>
                  <p>Participants highlighted that randomisation occurs presurgery, which is a particularly stressful and emotional time and, therefore, it is very important that the research team offer time and compassion for study participants who are not allocated into the intervention arm (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 54</italic>).</p>

                  <p>Patient-participants and physiotherapist-participants suggest that patients are likely to agree to participate in an RCT because there is very little support in usual care. Motivation to join research might be influenced by the patient’s current dysfunction and physiotherapist-participants explained that this might not manifest until much later on in the rehabilitation journey (<italic toggle="yes">Quote 57</italic>).</p>

                <title>Key findings</title>
                <p>This study identified the overwhelming need for additional support, to augment the usual care available in the UK’s National Health Service for patients with HNC undergoing ND surgery in order to improve their long-term outcomes. It also highlighted the importance of psychosocial support and integrating behaviour change techniques into complex interventions to support patients through their long-term rehabilitation journey.</p>
                <p>Previous qualitative investigations reported the profound biopsychosocial impact of HNC and its management on patient’s quality of life.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> Our results supported earlier qualitative work with this population<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and found that ND does not always, but can, have a large negative impact on the patient’s physical and mental functioning which decreases a patient’s quality of life.</p>
                <p>The physiotherapy delivered in GRRAND encouraged tailored physical rehabilitation alongside psychosocial education and support, which is documented as an important element in caring for patients with cancer.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Some of this is imparted during inpatient care, however, the patients explained that when they are inpatients they could not take all the information in and they explained that because their symptoms evolved over time they might not realise the impact on their lives until much later after their surgery.</p>
                <p>Evidence is growing to support the importance of patient-centred conversations in cancer rehabilitation, ensuring patients are equally empowered to ask questions and seek reassurances from their healthcare professionals.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Implementing a standardised methodology as part of the GRRAND intervention could assist in reducing social inequality in healthcare conversations. Treatment of patients with HNC varies due to the variety of clinical presentations. Prior evidence supports the integration of personalised strategies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The evidence from this study suggests that alongside personalised strategies, the GRRAND intervention could try and encourage self-management and empowerment to explore and discuss more options with healthcare providers in order to support long-term, meaningful improvements.</p>
                <p>Patients post-ND recognised long-term effects of their surgery on their mental and physical well-being. The GRRAND intervention was recognised as a useful tool which can generate long-term behavioural changes in patients to support their lifelong rehabilitation post-ND. However, recent evidence suggests<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 25</xref> that in order to maximise the effectiveness of an intervention such as GRRAND, for HNC patient rehabilitation, it must implement behaviour change strategies identified from a behavioural diagnosis using the COM-B model of behaviour change.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, the findings from this study recommend the next iteration of the GRRAND intervention is guided by the COM-B model of behaviour change intervention development.</p>
                <p>The behaviour change model could use findings which suggested it could be important to communicate the nature of the variation in symptomatology over time to increase patient motivation and engagement in a ‘preventative’ intervention framework.</p>
                <p>The participants did not raise any strong problems regarding the feasibility of conducting an RCT to test the effectiveness of the GRRAND intervention according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for pilot and feasibility testing.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The key strength of this study is the novelty of these findings. An overarching message from the data was how overlooked this patient population has been and how complicated their physical rehabilitation journeys may be.</p>
                <p>One researcher (BF) conducted all the interviews and conducted the framework analysis process; this led to the researcher having an immersive analytical experience. However, this does leave the analytical interpretation open to bias from a single perspective. We aimed to counterbalance this by performing iterative analysis presentation and discussion with the multidisciplinary trial management group (surgeons, physiotherapists, researcher analysts and patient perspective).</p>
                <p>The patient-participants we interviewed had remained engaged with the GRRAND-F Study for over 6 months. These months were during the COVID-19 pandemic, which presented additional burden and strain. Therefore, this group might represent a subgroup of the patient population who are highly motivated by research.</p>
                <p>The sample is small and while it meets theoretical requirements of including both men and women from both intervention and usual care experiences, its generalisability is limited. Due to COVID-19 interruption all the participants were from one geographical location rather than from the six locations we had anticipated. This sample is highly homogeneous (all white, all living in one area) and therefore limits the generalisability of these findings.</p>
                <p>A problematic limitation was that four participants who withdrew from the study also declined to be interviewed. Consequently, these data and our interpretation did not include perspectives from those who did not engage with GRRAND. Therefore, our interpretation can only be applied to those who do engage with the GRRAND intervention and this may leave a group of our target population unrepresented.</p>
                <p>However, by triangulating participant data with physiotherapist data we gain reflections from the physiotherapists who work across different geographical locations and with a broader more heterogenous patient population.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The patient-participants and physiotherapist-participants perceived the discharge leaflet and physiotherapy intervention to be acceptable. This patient group experiences huge variation in their physical, mental and social dysfunction postsurgery. The dysfunction usually presents once the patients have been discharged from inpatient care and returned home to their daily lives. Sometimes the dysfunction can develop over months or years. The GRRAND intervention could be tested as a preventative intervention which aims to upskill patients with physical exercises and the physiotherapy sessions provide essential psychosocial support to encourage patients to engage in long-term proactive exercise behaviours.</p>
