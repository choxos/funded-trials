                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The successful scale-up of a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection testing and treatment programme is essential to achieve TB elimination. However, poor adherence compromises its therapeutic effectiveness. Novel rifapentine-based regimens and treatment support based on behavioural science theory may improve treatment adherence and completion.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A pragmatic multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial assessing the effect of novel short-course rifapentine-based regimens for TB prevention and additional theory-based treatment support on treatment adherence against standard-of-care. Participants aged between 16 and 65 who are eligible to start TB preventive therapy will be recruited in England. 920 participants will be randomised to one of six arms with allocation ratio of 5:5:6:6:6:6: daily isoniazid +rifampicin for 3 months (3HR), routine treatment support (control); 3HR, additional treatment support; weekly isoniazid +rifapentine for 3 months (3HP), routine treatment support; weekly 3HP, additional treatment support; daily isoniazid +rifapentine for 1 month (1HP), routine treatment support; daily 1HP, additional treatment support. Additional treatment support comprises reminders using an electronic pillbox, a short animation, and leaflets based on the perceptions and practicalities approach. The primary outcome is adequate treatment adherence, defined as taking ≥90% of allocated doses within the pre-specified treatment period, measured by electronic pillboxes. Secondary outcomes include safety and TB incidence within 12 months. We will conduct process evaluation of the trial interventions and assess intervention acceptability and fidelity and mechanisms for effect and estimate the cost-effectiveness of novel regimens. The protocol was developed with patient and public involvement, which will continue throughout the trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Successful implementation of screening and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is critical to further reduce TB incidence globally and achieve TB elimination in low TB incidence countries.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A recent call to action issued by the WHO urged for accelerating the scale-up of treatment of LTBI, particularly to mitigate the negative impact from the disruption of TB services caused by the pandemic of COVID-19.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>Tuberculosis (TB) in England disproportionately affects underserved communities, such as migrants and homeless people, who consequently experience higher disease burden and worse clinical outcomes. Consequently, in England, LTBI screening and treatment for high risk groups such as new migrants from high TB incidence countries is recognised as an essential strategy to achieve TB elimination.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Contact tracing, including testing and treatment of LTBI among contacts, is another essential component of the TB strategy for England.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>Achieving optimal treatment adherence and completion is essential to ensure the efficacy of treatment for LTBI and to achieve commensurate reductions in TB incidence. Standard therapeutic options in the UK include 3 months of self-administered daily isoniazid/rifampicin and 6 months of daily isoniazid; the former regimen is often prescribed because of the availability of fixed-dose formulations and its shorter duration. While these regimen are efficacious in preventing disease, their effectiveness is limited by low treatment adherence and completion rates.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> According to data from England in migrants whose treatment outcome is known, 75% completed LTBI treatment between 2019 and 2020.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> The proportion of people who completed treatment varied by Clinical Commission Group (CCG), which was less than 70% in several CCGs.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>People with LTBI may need additional support to adhere to effective treatments. Treatment non-adherence can be intentional or unintentional, and is driven by a person’s motivation and ability to take medicine as prescribed, respectively.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Motivation is influenced by our perceptions (eg, beliefs and preferences) and ability is determined by practical factors (eg, internal capacity and resource).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These principles are operationalised as part of the perceptions and practicalities approach to supporting adherence (PAPA) and are applied in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The Necessity and Concerns Framework further explains how patients’ motivation to engage with treatment is based on their perceived necessity for, and concerns about the treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Necessity beliefs are influenced by perceptions of the health threat (eg, LTBI) and interpretation of symptoms. The asymptomatic nature of LTBI may negatively impact necessity beliefs, and heighten treatment concerns. As such, intervention to support treatment adherence in people with LTBI will likely be more effective if they address patient beliefs and concerns around treatment, in addition to removing practical barriers.</p>
              <p>The need to understand perceptual and practical barriers to treatment adherence, and the potential of advancing technology and drug regimens in the National Health Service (NHS) has been highlighted. Some mobile/digital technology (mHealth) has been shown to improve adherence in TB disease studies. A recent study in China found electronic reminders, using specially designed electronic medication monitors, improved treatment adherence in such TB patients, but multiple two-way daily text messaging reminders, didactic in nature, did not.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Most of the evidence available is on TB disease with little research on mHealth interventions to improve LTBI treatment adherence.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Another call to action issued by the WHO suggested TB preventive treatment programmes should consider communication technologies for medication adherence support.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The evidence on mHealth interventions for LTBI treatment would contribute to their global scale-up.</p>
              <p>Another approach to promote better treatment adherence and completion is to decrease the complexity of current LTBI regimens. A regimen that is given once weekly may result in better treatment completion than the current daily 3-month regimen. A randomised controlled trial demonstrated that a new regimen of 12 doses of weekly rifapentine and isoniazid (3HP) delivered through direct observation (ie, with patients being supervised taking each dose) is non-inferior to 9 months of daily isoniazid.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Our network meta-analysis suggests that 3HP has similar efficacy to the UK standard-of-care of a 12-week, daily isoniazid/rifampicin regimen (3HR).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, a recent trial in people living with HIV (23% with LTBI as demonstrated by a positive tuberculin skin test and/or Interferon Gamma Release Assay result) demonstrated non-inferiority of daily 1-month rifapentine plus isoniazid (1HP) compared with 9 months of daily isoniazid.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The 1-month regimen resulted in better adherence and fewer serious adverse events. Based on this study, and by extrapolating to HIV-negative individuals, newly published WHO guidelines recommend this regimen regardless of HIV status. However, there is no published evaluation of whether these more expensive rifapentine-based regimens lead to better treatment completion than the current daily administered UK standard-of-care. In particular, evidence is limited on the use of 3HP with patient self-administration and no study has compared its completion with 3HR.</p>
              <p>To develop tools to reduce TB rates, we need to evaluate advancing technology and drug regimens, but also understand the barriers and enablers of adherence.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> To date, adherence interventions have predominantly focused on removing practical barriers to adherence (eg, reminder of shortening the drug regimen). However, such approaches applied in isolation ignore patient beliefs. LTBI is asymptomatic which means patients might have a disconnect between medical advice and their perceived need for treatment.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> NICE guidelines recommend a PAPA to adherence support, whereby beliefs (necessity and concerns) are elicited and addressed in addition to practical barriers.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref></p>
              <p>We previously conducted the HALT-LTBI study, a pilot study assessing the safety and treatment completion of 3HP compared with standard care.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> HALT-LTBI demonstrated the feasibility of recruiting LTBI patients to such a trial; no serious adverse events defined as grade 3 or more were reported, supporting the safety of rifapentine and isoniazid regimens in individuals eligible for LTBI treatment in the UK. 78% and 68% of participants completed treatment in the experimental and standard-of-care arms, respectively, but the pilot was not powered to detect differences in treatment completion. Thus, we will conduct a fully powered trial to compare treatment adherence and adverse events of novel 3HP and 1HP regimens compared with 3HR and to assess the effect of additional treatment support in participants given each regimen.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effect of novel rifapentine-based regimens (3HP or 1HP) compared with the standard 90-dose daily rifampicin plus isoniazid (3HR), and the effect of additional treatment support compared with routine support, on LTBI treatment adherence.</p>
                <p>The secondary objectives are: (1) to evaluate the effect of LTBI treatment and additional treatment support using alternate measures of adherence outcome; and (2) to compare the frequency of adverse events while on treatment for LTBI, and development of TB within 12 months following treatment. Additionally, we will evaluate the process of delivering the adherence intervention and examine intervention fidelity and acceptability as well as the cost-effectiveness of different treatment options and/or additional treatment support.</p>

                <p>A factorial design was not chosen for several reasons. First, it is anticipated that there will be an interaction between type of regimen and treatment support; additional treatment support is likely to confer a smaller benefit with 3HP/1HP compared with 3HR. Second, the power to detect the effect of an intervention would be reduced if the effect of the second intervention is greater than expected.</p>

The animation will be supported by a leaflet that covers misperceptions about LTBI testing and treatment, and other frequently asked questions. Participants will also be asked to set reminders using an electronic pill monitor box (Wisepill EvriMed). The electronic pillbox allows two modes of reminders: audio alarm from the box or text-message to participants’ mobile phones.</p>
                  <p>The reminder can be set at prespecified times and can also be activated to send a reminder when the pill box is not opened. Site staff will discuss options with each participant and set reminders according to their preferences. Participants can opt not to receive reminders before or at the time of intended medication intake. However, they will still be reminded when the box is not opened within a pre-specified time in a day and they will receive a supportive text message automatically sent by the pillbox. The mode of reminder can be further adjusted during the course of treatment as necessary on discussion with a clinician. The pillbox will electronically collect the date and time of each opening.</p>
