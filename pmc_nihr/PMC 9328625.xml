                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Carotid endarterectomy is currently recommended for patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis â¥50%, based on randomised trials conducted 30 years ago. Several factors such as carotid plaque ulceration, age and associated comorbidities might influence the risk-benefit ratio of carotid revascularisation. A model developed in previous trials that calculates the future risk of stroke based on these features can be used to stratify patients into low, intermediate or high risk. Since the original trials, medical treatment has improved significantly. Our hypothesis is that patients with carotid stenosis â¥50% associated with a low to intermediate risk of stroke will not benefit from additional carotid revascularisation when treated with optimised medical therapy. We also hypothesise that prediction of future risk of stroke in individual patients with carotid stenosis can be improved using the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the carotid plaque.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Patients are randomised between immediate revascularisation plus OMT versus OMT alone. Suitable patients are those with asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid stenosis â¥50% with an estimated 5-year risk of stroke of &lt;20%, as calculated using the Carotid Artery Risk score. MRI of the brain at baseline and during follow-up will be used as a blinded measure to assess the incidence of silent infarction and haemorrhage, while carotid plaque MRI at baseline will be used to investigate the hypotheses that plaque characteristics determine future stroke risk and help identify a subgroup of patients that will benefit from revascularisation. An initial analysis will be conducted after recruitment of 320 patients with baseline MRI and a minimum of 2 years of follow-up, to provide data to inform the design and sample size for a continuation or re-launch of the study. The primary outcome measure of this initial analysis is the combined 2-year rate of any clinically manifest stroke, new cerebral infarct on MRI, myocardial infarction or periprocedural death.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">ECST-2 will provide new data on the efficacy of modern optimal medical therapy alone versus added carotid revascularisation in patients with carotid stenosis at low to intermediate risk of future stroke selected by individualised risk assessment. We anticipate that the results of baseline brain and carotid plaque MRI will provide data to improve the prediction of the risk of stroke and the effect of treatment in patients with carotid stenosis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par32">Atherosclerotic stenosis at or around the carotid bifurcation is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke in the ipsilateral carotid artery territory and accounts for 10â20% of all transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and ischaemic strokes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The first European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) and the North American Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) both showed a benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in preventing stroke in patients with symptomatic stenosis of â¥70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These trials show that CEA carried a perioperative risk of stroke and death of around 7%. Moreover, CEA did not prevent all recurrent strokes. NASCET did not show any benefit of CEA in patients with &lt;50% stenosis, but there was a small benefit in those with 50â69% stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The focus of guidelines based on ECST and NASCET has been to recommend CEA on the basis of the degree of carotid stenosis and this has dictated clinical practice to date. However, analysis of individual data from both these trials has shown that multiple factors in addition to the degree of stenosis, such as age, sex, time from index event, carotid plaque morphology and patient comorbidities, influenced the risk of future stroke in patients treated with medical therapy alone and also the amount of risk reduction through CEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par33">A risk model based on these factors, derived from ECST and validated in NASCET showed that in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, the risk of ipsilateral stroke on medical therapy could be accurately predicted from baseline characteristics. It was evident from this analysis that only patients with a high risk of subsequent ipsilateral stroke when treated medically benefitted from CEA, while patients with a lower risk of stroke (5-year risk of &lt;20%) did not benefit significantly because the benefit of surgery in the longer-term prevention of stroke did not justify the perioperative risk of stroke or death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Figure showing reliabilityÂ of aÂ predictive model of 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke derived from ECST data validatedÂ using results observed inÂ NASCET. The figure is adapted from Rothwell et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] [with the addition of arrows to showÂ the 5-year risk of stroke in CEA patients]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6429_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par34">In the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST), 3120 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis were randomised between immediate and deferred CEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This trial did not include a fixed minimum stenosis percentage. The results of this trial showed a benefit of CEA in patients younger than 75 years of age with â¥60% carotid stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Immediate CEA halved the 5-year stroke risk from 12 to 6% in these patients but the absolute risks were low (13.4% vs. 17.9%) with a net gain over 10 years of only 4.6% (95% CI 1.2â7.9). The median delay in this group was 1 month. The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) showed a similar reduction in risk among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis â¥60% who received CEA versus medical therapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. ACAS showed a 5-year stroke risk of 11.0% in the medical group compared to 5.1% in the surgical group with a relative reduction of stroke risk of 53% (95% CI 22â72). Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as an alternative method to revascularise carotid stenosis, but randomised trials in symptomatic patients suggested that the early risks of CAS outweigh those of CEA, except in patients younger than 70 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">Previous trials of CEA versus medical therapy assessed only clinically manifest stroke reported by the patient and confirmed by adjudication in line with the definition of stroke as symptoms likely to be of cerebrovascular origin lasting at least 24 h. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is much more sensitive than clinical assessment in detecting ischaemic brain infarcts. Silent brain infarcts on MRI were found in 8% of participants in the Rotterdam study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and developed in 20% of participants after 10 years of follow-up in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Silent infarcts on MRI are also seen after revascularisation procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. MRI can detect cerebral infarcts in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms and approximately doubles the number of episodes of cerebral infarction (clinically manifest and silent stroke) detected during follow-up. Thus, incorporation of new infarcts on brain MRI as an outcome measure is more sensitive than clinical assessment and therefore reduces the sample size required to demonstrate significant differences in the outcome between the two treatments. Another advantage of using MRI to assess outcome after stroke is that the determination of outcome is more objective than clinical assessment and outcome assessment can be done independently and blind to treatment and patient characteristics, unlike clinical assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Furthermore, MRI is able to detect structural features of plaque instability, such as intra-plaque haemorrhage (IPH), which may improve the identification of patients benefitting from carotid revascularisation. The presence of IPH increases the risk of stroke in patients with carotid stenosis by a factor of more than ten and predicts risk independently of the degree of stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">These considerations argued for a new trial to investigate the role of revascularisation in the setting of improved medical therapy adjusted to targets for risk factor control, i.e. optimised medical therapy (OMT), and using brain MRI to determine outcome measures. We therefore organised the Second European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST-2).</p>

                <p id="Par38">The objective of ECST-2 is to investigate the hypothesis that patients with carotid stenosis â¥50% associated with a low to intermediate risk of stroke will not benefit from additional carotid revascularisation when treated with optimised medical therapy. We also aim to investigate the hypothesis that the findings on baseline carotid plaque imaging can be used to predict future stroke risk and identify a subgroup of patients that will benefit from carotid revascularisation.</p>

                  <title>Use of the Carotid Artery Risk (CAR) score</title>
                  <p id="Par43">Patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid stenosis â¥50% with an estimated 5-year risk of stroke of &lt;20% are identified by centres as suitable for inclusion in ECST-2 using the Carotid Artery Risk (CAR) score. The CAR score predicts the 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke on the side of the stenotic carotid artery in patients treated with optimised medical therapy alone. The score was originally derived from the results of a Cox regression model using data from patients who had been randomised to medical treatment in the first ECST and was independently validated in the NASCET trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This showed that the model produced accurate predictions of future risk of stroke on best medical therapy alone. Those with a high risk of stroke on medical therapy alone did not have any increase in their risk of perioperative stroke from carotid endarterectomy. The model has been widely used in routine clinical practice to select patients for carotid endarterectomy, both in its full web-based form published as the Carotid Stenosis Risk Prediction Tool by the Stroke Prevention Unit at the University of Oxford and in the form of the risk tables derived from the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, given the evidence that the risks of stroke under medical therapy have declined since the time of ECST and NASCET, we recalibrated the model for use in ECST-2, taking into account the published effects of modern medical treatment of carotid stenosis and some additional risk data provided by the Stroke Prevention Unit. We named the output of the recalibrated model the Carotid Artery Risk (CAR) score. The CAR score is calculated based on the following patient characteristics: sex, age, diabetes, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, percentage of carotid stenosis, the presence of a near carotid occlusion, plaque ulceration, time in days from the last ischaemic event to expected day of randomisation, and type of event (major stroke/multiple or single TIA/monocular event). These factors are used to provide an individualised estimate of the patientâs 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke when treated with OMT alone. A tool is available on-line and as an app for use on smartphones and mobile devices to facilitate calculation of the CAR score in patients being considered for ECST-2.</p>
                  <p id="Par44">The CAR score is used to select recently symptomatic patients at low or intermediate risk of stroke, which is defined as a 5-year risk of stroke ipsilateral to the target carotid artery calculated by the CAR score as &lt;20%. Patients with a CAR score of â¥20% are excluded from the trial. Patients with asymptomatic stenosis or those with previous symptoms attributed to ipsilateral stenosis that had occurred more than 180 days prior to randomisation are also eligible for the trial and are assumed to have a low 5-year risk of â¤ 5% with OMT.</p>

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par47">ECST and NASCET were completed over 20 years ago and since then medical therapy has improved significantly. The widespread use of statins, lower targets for blood pressure control and more effective and promptly started antithrombotic therapy have been shown to lower the incidence of recurrent stroke in prospective registries and trials of stroke prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There has been a fall in the proportion of smokers, reduction in baseline cholesterol and blood pressure levels and increased use of dual antiplatelet therapy after stroke or TIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Subgroup analyses from randomised controlled trials and case-control studies have shown that statins lower the risk of stroke in patients with cerebrovascular disease by about a third and halve the numbers requiring CEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Systematic reviews have consistently shown a reduction in the average rates of ipsilateral stroke in patients with asymptomatic stenosis treated medically to as low as 1% per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There is also evidence that OMT with intensive risk factor control and adjustment of medical treatments to target, the annual risk of stroke associated with asymptomatic stenosis might be lowered to 0.6% per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par48">Coincidently with the improvement in medical management, there has also been a reduction in the operative risks of CEA since the time of the first trials, with most contemporary databases recording rates of perioperative stroke risk less than 2% in symptomatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Given the reductions in perioperative stroke risk and stroke risk with medical therapy alone since ECST, NASCET and ACST, the indications for carotid revascularisation are no longer clear. The data suggest that many patients in whom carotid revascularisation is recommended in line with guidelines based on the old trials may be receiving CEA without benefit and with a risk of harm. It is therefore very relevant to establish whether these patients should have OMT as the intervention of first-choice in the future.</p>

As a guide, we recommended a target total cholesterol of &lt;4.0mmol/L (&lt;155 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol &lt;2.0mmol/L (&lt;77 mg/dL) and treatment to lower blood pressure to a target of 135/85 mmHg for patients aged &lt;80 years and 150/90 mmHg for patients aged &gt;80 years.

Patients randomised to OMT alone should only receive revascularisation of the randomised artery if they have ipsilateral symptoms after randomisation which are attributed to the carotid stenosis and are considered to necessitate revascularisation. Such patients are not considered cross-overs. Patients requiring revascularisation because of new symptoms after allocation to OMT alone, as well as those requiring revascularisation of the contralateral, non-randomised carotid artery or needing a second carotid revascularisation procedure (e.g. because of symptomatic restenosis) can be re-treated with whichever method of revascularisation the local investigator considers most appropriate.</p>

                  <title>Carotid plaque imaging</title>
                  <p id="Par59">MRI is far superior to computed tomography (CT) in identifying the different components of a carotid plaque, in particular IPH. Several carotid plaque MRI protocols are summarised in a recent white paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Centres are given flexibility to choose their preferred plaque imaging protocol according to their local expertise from within a limited number of sequences varying in complexity and performed with or without the use of gadolinium-based contrast medium (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The basic protocol, which is well suited for demonstrating IPH, requires two sequences: 3D time of flight (TOF) and 3D magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) or an equivalent MRI sequence that allows visualisation of IPH. This minimum requirement could be implemented at any centre using a standard head-and-neck coil on a 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla system, although the latter is preferable. The sequences of the basic protocol will allow quantification of stenosis, as well as detection of plaque ulceration, calcification and IPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Ulcerations will be scored on contrast-enhanced MR angiography, alternatively on 3D TOF, or, if unavailable, any other sequence that allows identification of plaque ulceration. Plaque ulceration is defined as an intimal defect larger than 1 mm in width [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. IPH is identified as a hyperintense region (compared to the sternocleidomastoid muscle) in the bulk of the plaque on MPRAGE or if unavailable, TOF images or any other sequence that allows identification of IPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par60">More advanced sequences that have been designed to image plaque burden, the status of the fibrous cap and the size of lipid-rich necrotic core, based on recent expert consensus recommendations, are optional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A thin or ruptured fibrous cap is defined as an interrupted region of signal enhancement adjacent to the lumen on the post-contrast images overlying the lipid-rich necrotic or full absence of a region with signal enhancement adjacent to the lumen overlying the lipid-rich necrotic core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A quality score is used to indicate the certainty on the score. A lipid-rich necrotic core is identified as an area in the bulk of the plaque that is hyperintense on the T1-weighted black blood MR images, does not enhance on the post-contrast T1-weighted black blood images, and potentially is hypointense in the same region on T2-weighted MR images.</p>

Prior to randomisation, the following investigations are required: routine serum investigations, electroca rdiogram, imaging of both carotid bifurcations showing the severity of stenosis bilaterally and brain MRI. If MR is contra-indicated or not available within a reasonable time period for any reason, brain CT should be done instead. Baseline data will be collected at randomisation and includes the mRS assessed by using the Rankin Focused Assessment (RFA).

Patients are followed up by a neurologist or stroke physician, or a clinician/research practitioner under the close supervision of a neurologist or stroke physician. Required investigations during follow-up include at least annual measurements of the blood pressure and serum cholesterol and an annual carotid duplex ultrasound. Brain MRI is required at the time of randomisation and at 2 and 5 years after randomisation to determine the rate of the MR-based outcome events, unless contra-indicated. Additional brain MRI is required whenever a suspected stroke or a TIA occurs during the study period to confirm the clinical diagnosis. In patients with contraindications for MRI or if MRI was not available within a reasonable period, brain CT is allowed instead. MRI of the carotid plaque is also done prior to randomisation at centres able to perform the required sequences.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p> Outline of baseline and follow-up appointments including investigations required and target time window</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Visit/follow-up</th><th>Investigations</th><th>Target time window</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">Baseline</td><td>Brain MRI</td><td>14 days in symptomatic stenosis or 28 days in asymptomatic stenosis before or after randomisation, done before any revascularisation procedure</td></tr><tr><td>Initial carotid imaging</td><td>120 days before randomisation up to the day of randomisation</td></tr><tr><td>Confirmatory second carotid imaging</td><td>14 days before randomisation up to the day of randomisation</td></tr><tr><td><p>Clinical assessment, blood pressure</p><p>Baseline blood lipids and glucose, serum troponin levels</p><p>ECG</p><p>MoCA, EQ-5D, RFA</p></td><td>14 days before randomisation up to the day of randomisation</td></tr><tr><td>Post-procedure visit in revascularised patients only</td><td><p>Clinical assessment, blood pressure</p><p>Troponin and ECG</p></td><td>Day of treatment +48 h Â±24 h</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">4â6 weeks post-randomisation</td><td><p>Clinical assessment, blood pressure</p><p>MoCA, EQ-5D, RFA</p></td><td>Day of treatment +30 days Â±7 days in revascularised patients</td></tr><tr><td>ECG and troponin in the OMT arm</td><td>Day of randomisation +42 days Â±7 days in OMT only patients</td></tr><tr><td>Carotid ultrasound in revascularised patients</td><td>Day of treatment +30 days Â±7 days</td></tr><tr><td>Brain MRI (optional)</td><td><p>Day of treatment +30 days Â±7 days in revascularised patients</p><p>Day of randomisation +42 days Â±7days in OMT only patients</p></td></tr><tr><td>3 months post-randomisation</td><td>Telephone follow-up</td><td>Day of randomisation +90 days Â±14 days</td></tr><tr><td>6 months post-randomisation</td><td><p>Clinical assessment, blood pressure</p><p>EQ-5D, RFA</p><p>Fasting lipids and glucose</p></td><td>Day of randomisation +180 days Â±14 days</td></tr><tr><td>Annual follow-up</td><td><p>Clinical assessment, blood pressure</p><p>EQ-5D, RFA</p><p>Fasting lipids and glucose</p><p>Carotid ultrasound</p><p>MoCA and brain MRI at 2 and 5 years</p></td><td>Day of randomisation +X years Â±1 month</td></tr><tr><td>Bi-annual telephone follow-up</td><td>Telephone follow-ups between annual follow-ups</td><td>Day of randomisation +X years +6 months Â±1 month</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

                <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                <p id="Par63">We expect a rate of stroke in the OMT arm of approximately 3% at 2 years after randomisation. Silent ischaemic infarcts on MRI seem to occur at twice the frequency of clinically manifest strokes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Thus, we expect about 9% of patients on OMT to experience clinically manifest stroke or have silent new ischaemic infarct on MRI after 2 years of follow-up. In those allocated to revascularisation, we expect a peri-operative risk of stroke of 3%Â and a subsequent 2-year risk of stroke of 2%. Thus, we expect about 15% of patients in the revascularisation arm to experience clinically manifest stroke or have silent new ischaemic infarct on MRI after 2 years of follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par64">The rate of clinically manifest periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) in carotid revascularisation is about 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The 2-year risk of non-periprocedural MI is expected to be about 2% using the Framingham modelÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] based on the characteristics of patients in the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We therefore estimated a total 2-year risk of MI of 3% in patients randomised to revascularisation and 2% in those randomised to OMT. The periprocedural death rate (unrelated to MI or stroke) in ICSS patients undergoing CEA was 0.1%. The rate of the primary outcome event in ECST-2 of clinically manifest stroke, new ischaemic infarct on MRI, MI or periprocedural death at 2 years was therefore estimated at 11% in the OMT arm alone and 18% in the revascularisation arm. Assuming these outcome event rates, 314 patients (157 in each arm) provide 80% power to demonstrate that OMT is non-inferior to OMT plus revascularisation with a non-inferiority margin of 4%. Allowing for a dropout of 15% of patients missing their 2-year MRI, we plan to recruit 360 patients for the MRI-based analysis.</p>

                  <p id="Par84">Outcome events will be documented in detail by the investigating centre. Patients suffering from a stroke should have an MRI brain scan as soon as possible after the event (or CT if contraindicated). An electronic copy of this will be submitted together with a report of the event. For MI, documentation of changes in cardiac biomarkers and copies of ECG recordings should be returned to the trial office. The event report will include copies of discharge summaries, death certificates and post-mortem results if relevant. Deaths of UK patients will be tracked by flagging patients against the UK Registry of Births and Deaths. Disability after stroke and cranial nerve palsy will be assessed 30 days and 6 months after treatment or onset, using the mRS. Duration of symptoms will be recorded and outcome events will be classified as disabling if the mRS is 3 or more. Reports of outcome events will be censored after receipt at the central office to remove information concerning treatment allocation as far as practical and then sent for adjudication as soon as sufficient information concerning the event has been received. Major outcome events will be adjudicated by two neurologists or cardiologists, depending on the reported event, at least one of whom will be independent of the trial. If the two physicians differ significantly in the classification of the event, the data will be sent to another independent adjudicator for their views. Major conflicts will be resolved by consensus or a majority view if consensus is not achieved. Additional information may be requested at any time by the central office or an adjudicating physician.</p>
                  <p id="Par85">If the local investigator or other member of the team, at a trial centre, has concern about the outcome of their trial procedures, they should inform the trial office, which will organise a blinded assessment of the relevant outcome events. This will be submitted by the central office to the chairman of the Data Monitoring Committee who may recommend further action, such as suspending randomisation at the centre. Similarly, the database manager at the trial office will monitor outcome events and if there are two consecutive deaths or three consecutive major events at a single centre within 30 days of treatment in the same arm of the study, then assessment of the events will be triggered. A cumulative major event or death rate of 10% or more over 20 cases would also trigger careful assessment of the relevant outcome events.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par92">The objective of ECST-2 is to test the hypothesis that patients with carotid stenosis â¥50% associated with a low to intermediate risk of stroke will not benefit from additional carotid revascularisation when treated with optimised medical therapy, because vascularisation surgery will cause more periprocedural vascular events than are prevented by removal of the plaque. ECST-2 is designed to closely reflect current medical practice so that the results of the trial are applicable to everyday medicine.</p>
              <p id="Par93">ECST-2 differs from previous and ongoing trials of carotid stenosis in several important aspects. Firstly, to select patients for the trial, rather than selecting patients on the basis of symptom status as in previous carotid trials, ECST-2 uses an individualised risk assessment tool, the Carotid Artery Risk (CAR) score, which is derived from a validated model based on several clinical variables. It is notable that many patients with symptomatic stenosis have a low predicted risk of future stroke similar to that of patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Therefore, ECST-2 includes both patients with lower risk symptomatic stenosis and those with asymptomatic stenosis, viewing risk as a spectrum for which symptomatic status contributes only a part. Secondly, ECST-2 defined OMT using international guidelines and encouraged achievement of these guideline-based treatment targets, unlike previous carotid trials which did not define best medical treatment. Thirdly, ECST-2 routinely uses MRI as an additional, sensitive and objective tool that can be analysed blind to treatment to assess ischaemic or haemorrhagic brain injury at enrolment and occurring as a consequence of revascularisation or the failure of medical treatment during follow-up. Finally, the trial also represents a unique opportunity to investigate whether the findings on MRI of the carotid plaque help select patients who benefit from revascularisation. Plaque MRI has been assessed in non-randomised prospective carotid disease studies, which suggest that certain features including IPH, visualised using appropriate MR sequences, predict a high rate of future ischaemic stroke on medical therapy alone, independent of the degree of stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The presence of IPH correlates with a higher risk of ipsilateral stroke in patients with symptomatic stenosis with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 10.2 (95% CI 4.6â22.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, these studies have not established whether IPH also predicts a higher rate of perioperative stroke in patients receiving early revascularisation, nor whether patients with IPH, who otherwise appear to have a low risk of recurrent stroke and randomised to OMT only, benefit from carotid revascularisation. ECST-2 provides a unique opportunity to answer these questions.</p>
              <p id="Par94">We recognise that event rates might be different to those predicted and therefore the analysis of the trial might not yield sufficient evidence to prove or refute our hypothesis. Thus, to determine the optimum management of low-risk patients with carotid stenosis, the results of further trials will be needed, including those of CREST-2 (Second Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial), SPACE-2 (Stent Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy), and ACTRIS (Endarterectomy Combined With OMT vs OMT Alone in Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Atherosclerotic Carotid Artery Stenosis at Higher-Than-Average Risk of Ipsilateral Stroke, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02841098">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02841098</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par95">Current guidelines are based on the results of randomised clinical trials performed several decades ago, despite remarkable falls in rates of stroke associated with carotid stenosis related to improvements in medical and surgical practice. The results of ECST-2 and other ongoing trials will allow the guidelines to be updated with more current figures forÂ surgical complication rates and risks on OMT alone.</p>
              <p id="Par96">A further main aim of ECST-2 is to determine whether the use of the CAR score, baseline brain MRI and baseline plaque MRI can be used to improve risk prediction in individual patients. We anticipate that the results of ECST-2 together with the results of other studies of brain and plaque imaging will usher in an era of personalised stroke prevention for patients with atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis in which treatment (OMT with or without revascularisation) is recommended for patients based on individualised assessment of their future stroke risk incorporating imaging-based analysis (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p id="Par97">ECST-2 was registered as an international clinical trial in the ISRCTN registry in July 2012 (ISRCTN97744893). It was originally conceived that an initial analysis would be performed, based on the MRI analysis of cerebral infarction and haemorrhage, as described above, to inform the design and sample size of a continuation of the trial, with an anticipated final sample size of 2000 required to perform an analysis based on clinically evident events only. However, the technology available to assess risk was rapidly advancing with the development of MRI of the carotid plaque and the demonstration that IPH appeared to be a powerful predictor of stroke outcome in lower-risk patients treated medically. The steering committee therefore decided to suspend randomisation in ECST-2 in October 2020 after recruiting sufficient patients to conduct both the planned brain imaging-based analysis of outcome events and the plaque MRI analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 andÂ 2021 impacted on the follow-up of the study population by delaying visits at some centres, but currently, follow-up is planned to continue to allow a 5-year follow-up of the last enrolled patients. A decision will be made on the design for the re-launch of randomisation in ECST-2 with a similar or altered design when the results of the initial analysis are available. The steering committee was also cognisant that new funding would be required to re-launch recruitment in the trial.</p>

              <p>This paper presents independent research initially funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Programme (Grant Reference Number PB-PG-0609-19216). The study continued with an additional project grant from the Stroke Association (Grant Reference Number TSA 2013/04) to allow recruitment of the sample size of 320 patients with MR brain imaging required for the initial analysis. Funding was subsequently obtained from the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant number 32003B-156658) to support additional MR plaque imaging, and for a cost-effectiveness analysis by the Netherlands Organisation of Scientific Research (ZONMW; project nr. 843004107). Part of the work was undertaken at University College London and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which receives a proportion of funding from the UK Department of Healthâs National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centres funding scheme. The views expressed in the paper are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care. The funding bodies have no role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.</p>
