                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Just under half of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) also have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). These conditions appear to be inter-related and continual positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, the gold standard treatment for OSA to prevent airway collapse, has been shown to reduce GORD. As the impact of mandibular advancement devices, a second-line therapy for OSA, on GORD has yet to be investigated, a feasibility study is needed prior to a definitive trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This will be a single-centre, single-blinded, tertiary-care based, interdisciplinary, parallel randomised controlled study. Potential OSA participants presenting to the sleep department will be pre-screened for GORD using validated questionnaires, consented and invited to receive simultaneous home sleep and oesophageal pH monitoring. Those with confirmed OSA and GORD (n=44) will be randomly allocated to receive either CPAP (n=22) or MAD therapy (n=22). Following successful titration and 3 weeks customisation period, participants will repeat the simultaneous sleep and oesophageal pH monitoring while wearing the device. The number of patients screened for recruitment, drop-out rates, patient feedback of the study protocol, costs of interventions and clinical information to inform a definitive study design will be investigated.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Health Research Authority approval has been obtained from the Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee, ref:22/EM/0157 and the trial has been registered on ISRCTN (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN16013232" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN16013232</ext-link>). Definitive findings about the feasibility of doing 24 hour pH oesophageal monitoring while doing a home sleep study will be disseminated via clinical and research networks facilitating valuable insights into the simultaneous management of both conditions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>One billion people worldwide and 8 million people in the UK (24.5% of the population) are estimated to have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is the most common sleep disorder, characterised by frequent pauses in breathing (apnoeas and hypopnoeas) during sleep due to airway blockage caused by intermittent relaxation of the throat muscles. Sleep becomes broken, so in the daytime patients reported of sleepiness, fatigue and have other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, feeling irritable and depressed.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Their own and their bed partner’s quality of life is reduced.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Patients are at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes and dying of all causes compared with people without OSA. This risk increases with OSA severity; with severe OSA, the risk of cardiac events and strokes is doubled and of cardiac death is tripled.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> People with untreated OSA also put the public in danger as they have more road traffic accidents than people without OSA and compared with themselves once on treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The societal level-costs of undiagnosed OSA in the USA alone amounted to over $150 billion per year.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In Italy, OSA causes an economic burden ranging from €10.7 to €32 billion per year.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), defined by the montreal consensus as ‘a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications’ with oesophageal/typical and extraoesophageal/atypical symptoms,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> is also common in the UK. There is a strong association between OSA and GORD, partly due to common risk factors such as obesity, high alcohol consumption and diet and also due to the impact that apnoeic events have on the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A recent meta-analysis estimated that 45.2% of OSA patients had episodes of extra-oesophageal reflux independent of BMI.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Around 40–81% of patients suffering from GORD report that their symptoms occur during sleep.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> There is a growing body of evidence that ontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, the gold-standard therapy for OSA,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> can reduce levels of gastro-oesophageal disease<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> by maintaining a patent airway, thus reducing intrathoracic pressure differentials. CPAP therapy increases the baseline LOS barrier pressure during sphincter relaxation and decreases the duration of sphincter relaxation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Mandibular advancement devices (MADs), a second line therapy, also maintain a patent airway, which may also have a similar impact on intrathoracic pressure differentials and duration of LOS relaxation. In addition, the greater compliance observed with MADs may mean that reflux is suppressed for a greater proportion of the night.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, both theories remain untested to date. We do not have sufficient data to gauge an effect size for a definitive powered trial. We do not know if patients are willing to wear multiple devices and tests while trying to sleep and whether acceptability will influence the data. We are also unaware of the most appropriate quality of life measure to accurately assess patient impact and health economics. Therefore, a feasibility trial is needed prior to a definitive evaluation.</p>
              <p>From an NHS perspective, CPAP and MADs are both cost-effective treatments.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> CPAP therapy has been shown to generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below £5000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Using CPAP over a period of 14 years resulted in saving National Health Service (NHS) costs (nearly £1000 per patient) and generated health benefits for people with OSA, for example, reduction in stroke risk and road traffic accidents.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>In the UK, the yearly medication costs of GORD treatment are around £200 million for histamine receptor antagonists and £300 million for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The cost implication of the impact of CPAP therapy or MAD therapy on GORD has yet to be evaluated.</p>
              <p>The overall aim of this project is to conduct a feasibility study to assess patient recruitment and tolerance of the trial. The secondary aims are to calculate an estimate of the primary outcome effect to determine the sample size needed for the definitive trial if the progression criteria are met, to determine the optimum measure of quality-of-life impact for this patient cohort.</p>

The prescreening questions for dental examination will ask patients if they have at least 10 teeth in each jaw, no loose teeth, fillings or caps or obvious holes in your teeth. Interested participants, who meet the pre-screening criteria, will be provided with a patient information sheet of the entire trial and invited to have a dental screening during their gastroenterology appointment, followed by a combined home sleep study and 24-hour pH impedance oesophageal monitoring. It will be explained that participation in the trial will be dependent on meeting the strict inclusion criteria, but they will be reimbursed for the screening appointment.</p>

                <title>Study screening procedures</title>
                <p>Following written informed consent by a trained member of the research team, participants will undergo assessments at a screening visit to ensure eligibility is met. Participants will be informed that PPIs will need to be stopped 7 days prior and H2-receptor antagonists or antacids 48 hours prior to this visit. Participants will complete an RSI questionnaire, ESS questionnaire, Leicester Cough Questionnaire and several QoL questionnaires. A full dental examination will be conducted to ensure that participants are dentally fit to wear an MAD if allocated to this intervention. For the gastroenterology assessment, the patient will initially need to undergo high-resolution manometry (HRM). Following local analgesia of the nares the catheter will be introduced transnasally and the patient instructed to drink water through a straw while the HRM catheter is advanced to the stomach. The HRM catheter depth will be adjusted to ensure manometric visual of the upper oesophageal sphincter, the gastro-oesophageal junction and gastric pressures. Ten single swallows of 5 mL will be performed with each being 20 s apart. Each 5 mL water swallow will be assessed in accordance with Chicago classification (V.3) using Manoview software (V.3) (Sierra Scientific Instruments). The HRM catheter will then be removed.</p>
                <p>Patients will then undergo reflux monitoring using Sandhill Scientific multichannel impedance pH catheters (ZANBG-44), which are inserted transnasally after applying local anaesthesia (xylocaine). The dual pH sensors of the catheter will be positioned 5 cm below and above the manometric LOS. The impedance sensors will be positioned above the LOS by 3 cm, 5 cm, 9 cm, 15 cm and 19 cm. The data will be captured by ZepHrTM recording device.</p>
                <p>For the 24 hours while the probe is inserted, the participant will be asked to complete a food diary as food and drink will impact on their reflux. Stopping reflux medication and the food diary are part of standard care for this procedure.</p>
                <p>Following placement of the catheter, participants will be invited for their home sleep study. A type 3 sleep study device, the WatchPAT 200 (WP200; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) will be given in addition to comprehensive instructions on how to perform a home sleep study. A 24-hour number for technical support will be provided to the patient. After their overnight sleep study, they will return the following day to the gastroenterology department for removal of the probe and return of the WatchPAT.</p>
                <p>The gastroenterology data will be captured by ZepHrTM recording device and data will be analysed using the BioVIEW Analysis software (V.5.7.1.0). The sleep study data will be analysed by a qualified sleep technician.</p>

A dental examination will be carried out by the research dentist to ensure there have been no changes in the oral cavity. Participants will be asked to review their diet diary from the day they first did the test and repeat what they ate or drank as closely as possible for the day. That afternoon the participant will attend the oesophageal physiology laboratory. Participants will repeat the RSI questionnaire, ESS questionnaire, Leicester Cough Questionnaire and a QoL questionnaire. The pH impedance testing and Watch-PAT testing will be repeated as described above. Compliance levels for the MAD and CPAP therapy on the same night will be obtained.</p>
                <p>On returning the next day to have their pH probe removed and to return the Watch-PAT, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their views in taking part in the study.</p>

                <p>This is a single-blinded study. The statistician is the only member of the team who can be blinded to the allocation. The database has been created such that the intervention is not known to the statistician when performing the analysis. The patient and clinician cannot be blinded to the group allocation due to the nature of the therapeutic devices used. However, the objective, computer-generated clinical measurement outcome in for the definitive trial is less likely to be subject to bias.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>There are several studies investigating change in per cent acid exposure from baseline while wearing the CPAP device. Sample sizes suggested from current data based on change in total acid were between 86 to 168 per group (excluding any attrition).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 39</xref> Using the smallest effect size published (Tawk <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), assuming a one-sided non-inferiority design with a margin of 4.15 (per cent total acid) together with an SD of 10.8 with a power of 90% and alpha of 2.5% for a definitive study, this would require a sample of 288 (without attrition). Considering the likelihood of the main study finding an effect of this size within a 80% CI, then an approach taken by Cocks and Torgerson<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> requires a feasibility sample equivalent to approximately 9% of the proposed definitive sample requiring 26 participants. Accommodating an overall attrition rate, including tolerance to the devices, of 40% requires a sample of 44 to be randomised. A sample of 44 will also give us a 95% CI of +/−14% around the attrition rate.</p>

Although determining differences in clinical outcomes between the arms is not the primary purpose of this feasibility study, comparisons will be undertaken to investigate the feasibility of studying these outcomes and to calculate potential estimates and 95% CIs. As recommended in guidelines for good practice for the analysis of pilot studies,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> the focus of the results will be on the estimates of the treatments rather than statistical significance and as such no hypothesis testing will be undertaken. Differences between the two comparison groups will be presented in the form of an unadjusted mean difference for continuous outcomes, and an OR for binary outcomes, with their associated 95% CIs. These comparisons will be made on an intention to treat basis with consideration given to per protocol analysis as sensitivity. While every effort will be made to minimise missing data, assessment of the levels of missing data will indicate suitability of measures to be continued into the definitive trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Given the increasing prevalence of both OSA and GORD, it is important to further investigate the inter-relationship between the conditions and the impact of OSA treatment on GORD. While there is evidence that CPAP reduces GORD, the effect size is unclear, and the impact of MADs on GORD is entirely un-investigated.</p>
              <p>This feasibility trial is designed as a first step to provide this important information for patients deciding on treatment choices and the prescribing sleep clinician. This trial will give us insights into the feasibility for testing patients, patient experience, the mechanism of action and the overall effect. There were several items for consideration when developing the study design. First, we chose to use a level 2 sleep study rather than polysomnography. This was because a level 2 device is sufficient for diagnosis of OSAS provided no other respiratory/sleep pathologies are suspected. At the time of recruitment, all participants had been assessed by their managing consultant and diagnosed as having suspect OSAS. The primary outcome of this study is a gastroenterology outcome and AHI is used solely as the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the final assessment night for the patient will necessitate them to wear a sleep study device, a nasal pH monitor and their MAD or CPAP therapeutic intervention. We thought this would be easier for the patient if done at home. Finally, we would like the definitive trial to be a multicentre trial. Not all centres will have capacity for polysomnography. For these reasons, we deemed that a Watch-PAT was appropriate. We have also considered items such as the interference of the nasal catheter with the CPAP mask. This has been extensively discussed with our PPI group, some of whom have already undergone 24-hour pH monitoring while wearing their CPAP. The mask seal can be maintained with strategic placement of the nasal catheter and tape. There is also precedent for this in previous studies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 16</xref> However, the feasibility of this will be explored.</p>
              <p>We will also explore health economic measures to best capture the cost of services versus the value obtained for patients and healthcare providers. From a UK NHS perspective, both CPAP and MADs are reported to be similarly cost-effective treatments.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This may change once their efficacy on the management of nocturnal gastro-oesophageal reflux is assessed. Investigation into the health economic feasibility for other funding systems is beyond the scope of this initial feasibility paper. However, we will be informing on the best measures to capture health economic outcomes, which can then be used in different healthcare funding environments.</p>

                <p>The trial was designed to generate evidence for patients with both OSA and GORD who are deciding on their treatment options. Our patient coapplicant is highly active within the OSA community with both feedback and dissemination means at a national level (Hope2Sleep Charity). We have an active PPI group who were also involved in the review and development of study protocol and patient information sheets. Patient advocacy is an important part of our oversight committee and our patient coapplicant is in charge of ensuring that the patient perspective is presented throughout the duration of the trial lifecycle. All findings from the study will be made available for dissemination to the public.</p>
