                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Research into the optimal management of frail patients with cancer is limited and treatment decision-making in this cohort can be difficult. A number of measures have been developed to assess frailty, but few studies explore the correlation between frailty measures and cancer treatment outcomes.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This retrospective cohort study is an exploratory analysis of the GO2 randomised controlled trial. GO2 recruited both older and frail younger patients commencing first-line palliative chemotherapy for advanced gastro-oesophageal (aGO) cancer. This analysis aims to explore the correlation between baseline frailty and treatment outcome. Baseline frailty measures were derived from clinical data and included ECOG Performance Status (PS), the GO2 Frailty Score (GO2FS), Geriatric-8 (G8), Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) toxicity score and a ‘modified’ Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (mCFS). Novel patient-centred composite measure Overall Treatment Utility (OTU) was the primary endpoint. Ordinal logistic regression was undertaken to give odds ratios for poor vs good/intermediate OTU. Secondary endpoints were progression-free and overall survival. Models were adjusted for age, sex, histology, metastases, Trastuzumab and renal/hepatic function.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In GO2, 514 patients were randomised between three chemotherapy dose-levels; all of these patients were assessed for OTU and are included in this analysis. Worse GO2FS, mCFS and G8 scores all had a statistically significant association with poor (vs good/intermediate) OTU, progression and death, which persisted after adjustment. Adjusted odds ratios for poor OTU amongst those with the worst GO2FS and mCFS and best G8 scores were as follows: 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–2.88) for GO2FS ≥3 (‘severely frail’), 1.72 (1.19–2.50) for mCFS 5+ (‘frail’) and 0.57 (0.32–1.00) for G8 &gt; 14 (‘normal’). Worse ECOG PS and CARG scores did not have a statistically significant association with poor OTU/progression/death.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>In this study, frailty identified via GO2FS, mCFS and G8 conveyed a statistically significant increased risk of worse treatment outcome in older and frail younger patients with aGO cancer. Frailty assessment provides information over and above PS and should be integrated alongside routine assessments in research and clinical practice. In the absence of prospective data, frailty measures can be derived retrospectively to build the evidence base around optimal care of frailer patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0005">Frailty due to older age or co-morbidities is common in patients with cancer and is associated with an increased risk of treatment complications [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite this, many clinical trials exclude older and frail younger patients, so evidence to guide optimal management is lacking. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) is the most widely used tool for assessing fitness for systemic anticancer therapy (SACT), but lacks granularity [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and a number of criticisms have been highlighted [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (CFS) is a global assessment of fitness which has extensive evidence of correlation with outcome in a range of acute and outpatient settings, and has been adopted for use by the NHS Specialised Clinical Frailty Network (SCFN) in the United Kingdom (UK) [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has also been proposed as an alternative to ECOG PS [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but remains largely untested in the oncology setting.</p>
              <p id="p0010">Frailty screening tools to guide intervention and management of older cancer patients recommended by ASCO guidelines [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] include the Geriatric-8 (G8) [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES)-13 [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which have both been independently associated with adverse outcomes in older patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Additionally, two toxicity prediction tools are recommended which have been demonstrated to provide estimates of risk of significant (grade ≥ 3) chemotherapy toxicity in older patients with cancer; Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients (CRASH) [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0015">The aim of this study is to explore the correlation between baseline frailty measures and global treatment outcomes in older and frail younger patients with advanced gastro-oesophageal (aGO) cancer in the GO2 trial. The GO2 trial is a phase III randomised-controlled trial which sought to optimise chemotherapy dosing for older and frail younger patients with aGO cancer, and established 60% duplet chemotherapy as a new standard of care for these patients [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It also incorporated the novel patient-centred composite end-point Overall Treatment Utility (OTU) as a global measure of treatment outcome. OTU is categorised as Good, Intermediate or Poor by combining a range of factors particularly relevant to frail and older patients with advanced cancer, including clinical efficacy, toxicity, tolerability, and the patient's own assessment of treatment value (see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). GO2 is one of the largest studies prospectively exploring the treatment of older and frail younger patients, and extensive baseline data collected through geriatric assessment (GA) provides a unique opportunity to explore the correlation between frailty and treatment outcomes.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overall treatment utility (OTU) scoring in the GO2 trial.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

Further details about eligibility and recruitment can be found in the publication of the primary analysis and trial protocol [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All patients in the CHEMO-INTENSITY pathway (i.e. those being randomised between different dose levels of chemotherapy, rather than 60% chemotherapy vs best supportive care) were included in this analysis (514 patients).</p>

                <p id="p0045">Rockwood CFS is a simple global assessment of fitness designed to be undertaken by a clinician. Patients are scored 1–9 based on descriptors outlining functional capabilities, fatigue and impact of symptoms [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Rockwood CFS was not collected prospectively in GO2, but given its exceptional simplicity and growing use in the UK [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we were keen to derive a proxy measure for this study from the baseline questionnaire data. As a piece of exploratory work, authors JP (oncology trainee), DS (oncology consultant) and SN (elderly medicine consultant) drafted an algorithm to derive a ‘modified’ CFS based on selected questions and responses in the baseline assessments/questionnaires which aligned closest with the Rockwood CFS scores and descriptors. The algorithm was independently reviewed by two elderly medicine consultants for face validity and amended in line with feedback until a ‘best fit’ for deriving CFS from the available data was agreed (supplementary appendix 1). Rockwood CFS is a 9-point scale (1 ‘Very Fit’ – 9 ‘Terminally Ill’); the modified CFS (mCFS) was abbreviated to a 7-point scale (1 ‘Very Fit’ - 7 ‘Living with Severe Frailty’), as patients with the extreme degree of frailty reflected by a Rockwood CFS &gt;7 would not have been considered eligible for GO2 on fitness grounds, and additionally because the baseline questionnaire data was unable to reliably identify patients whom fulfilled the descriptors for Rockwood CFS scores of 8 (‘Living with very severe frailty’) or 9 (‘Terminally ill’).</p>

                <p id="p0055">The coding platform Rstudio was used to calculate frailty scores and undertake statistical analyses. OTU comparisons used ordinal logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for a poor vs good or intermediate OTU with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cox proportional hazards (CPH) regression [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were used to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs and Kaplan-Meier methods [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were used to estimate survivor functions for time-to-event endpoints. Numeric and grouped data was used for the ordinal logistic regression, and grouped data for CPH regression. Analyses for all frailty measures were treated and reported in the same way, for consistency and to allow comparison between ORs and HRs for each frailty measure. Groupings and rationale for GO2FS, CARG and G8 are outlined in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Models were adjusted for potential confounders: age group, sex, histology, distant metastases, planned use of Trastuzumab and dose reduction due to renal or hepatic function. Performance status was also adjusted for in additional analyses of GO2FS, mCFS, G8 and CARG, to provide an indication as to whether these scores add information on top of the current standard of care in fitness assessment (PS), but was not included in the final adjustment for consistency and due to concerns regarding co-linearity between frailty measures and PS. Variable Inflation Factors (VIF) testing was undertaken on each model to look for multi-collinearity.</p>

                <title>Key Findings</title>
                <p id="p0110">This retrospective cohort study explored the correlation between frailty measures and treatment outcomes in the GO2 randomised controlled trial database. Higher GO2FS and mCFS scores and lower G8 scores were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of poor Overall Treatment Utility, progression and death. This persisted after adjustment for confounding factors, including PS, demonstrating that assessment of frailty adds value on top of PS. Higher PS and CARG scores were also associated with a higher risk of poor outcome, but this was not statistically significant (except pre-adjustment HRs for death and progression in PS2 patients, and post-adjustment ORs for poor OTU in the numeric CARG analysis and categorical CARG ‘high risk’ sub-group). It may be that this study was underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference in outcome for these measures. Hazard ratios for mortality for frail patients were comparable to those reported elsewhere in the literature [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>

                <title>Selection of Frailty Measures</title>
                <p id="p0115">The derivable measures selected for evaluation included a range of measures with a potential role in assessing older and frail younger patients prior to SACT. It is important to note that whilst the CARG score does assess some frailty domains (e.g. mobility/falls and IADLs), it is not a frailty assessment per-se and is designed to predict short-term toxicity rather than longer-term outcomes. Regardless, we felt it would be interesting and valuable to see whether this translated to predicting global outcomes. Unfortunately, there were a number of notable measures, including VES-13, the Edmonton frailty score and CRASH toxicity score, which we were unable to derive. It is also important to note that many of the measures analysed here are only validated in specific age groups e.g. &gt;70 for G8 [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and &gt; 65 for CFS [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We opted to undertake all analyses on the whole cohort (including frail younger patients), treating all frailty measures the same as far as possible. This likely improved the power of the study to detect a statistically significant association between frailty and outcome, but could have caused under-estimation of the association between frailty and outcome in older patients. Significant associations were detected despite inclusion of all ages. Further study to validate frailty measures in younger cohorts is warranted.</p>

                <title>Implications of the Prognostic Capacity of Frailty Measures</title>
                <p id="p0120">Performance status was not associated with outcome in this analysis, further highlighting its shortcomings as a measure of fitness to guide treatment decision-making in oncological practice. However, frailty (identified via a range of measures) is associated with poor treatment outcome, and that association persisted after adjusting for PS in most cases, supporting the notion that frailty measures offer additional value to PS in assessing fitness for and weighing risks and benefits of SACT [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The correlation of frailty measures with OTU, a global patient-centred measure of treatment outcome, highlights that of assessment of frailty has prognostic value beyond traditional survival outcomes, further emphasising their potential role of frailty assessment in holistic decision-making. The question also remains as to whether the assessment of frailty and understanding of the association between frailty and outcome can be used to inform discussions and shared decision-making alongside patients. In the initial GO2 study analysis [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a univariate analysis was undertaken to identify variables which predicted OTU; frailty (via GO2FS) was one of three variables that were independently predictive of OTU (alongside neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio and baseline global self-rated health via ED-5D). A multivariable model was created whereby each of these three variables can be fed in to provide estimates for the probability of a good, intermediate and poor OTU. Further study could look to further validate this model and explore whether GO2FS could be replaced with a simpler measure of frailty (e.g. CFS or G8) to improve the acceptability and feasibility of applying the model in clinical practice, as a clinical and/or patient decision-aid.</p>
                <p id="p0125">Frailty assessments are not widely undertaken in clinical trials or clinical practice, but these findings add weight to the argument that they should be integrated into routine practice [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The fact that the findings are relatively consistent across a range of frailty measures demonstrates that any measure of frailty likely has some value in decision-making, but for widespread use a measure would need to be both validated in this setting and feasible to undertake in day-to-day practice. A key strength of G8 is that it has been specifically developed and validated in the cancer setting and is recommended in international guidelines [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It can be undertaken with relative ease, but does still require the completion of a questionnaire which can be a barrier to use in a busy clinical environment. In contrast, CFS has been developed and widely tested in other settings [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>], but despite its increasing interest in cancer care, it is not yet validated in cancer settings. However, it can be undertaken as part of the routine assessment of a patients' symptoms, functioning and social circumstances with no additional paperwork or assessments required, which gives it great potential for implementation within the busy clinic setting. We feel its simplicity and cross-speciality use make it a potentially fantastic tool for providing a common language for assessment and communication of frailty, spanning all specialities and professionals involved in cancer care, but further validation in the cancer setting is required to support its use.</p>

                <title>Assessment and Retrospective Derivation of Frailty in Cancer Research</title>
                <p id="p0130">This study provides proof of concept for the ability to derive a global measure of frailty such as mCFS retrospectively from questionnaire responses in existing datasets such as clinical trials, which and could prove valuable for studying frailty. Given that frailty is clearly a confounder to cancer treatment outcome, we propose that frailty should be assessed at baseline and reported alongside demographic data in cancer research (including observational studies and clinical trials), to provide an understanding of the extent and outcomes of frailty within cancer cohorts. However, in the absence of prospective frailty assessment, retrospectively derived measures could have a role and where the required data exists, the R code created for this analysis could be applied to other datasets with relative ease. For example, mCFS could be derived from other datasets that have collected EORTC QLQ-C30 (for mCFS 1–4), IADL (for CFS 5–6) and EQ-5D (for mCFS 7) and work is going to identify potential datasets in which to test the algorithm. Moving forward, international consensus for the measurement and reporting of frailty in clinical trials would be valuable.</p>

                <title>The mCFS Algorithm and CFS</title>
                <p id="p0135">The retrospective derivation of mCFS in this analysis is a key limitation of this study. In developing the algorithm to derive mCFS, it was notable that the baseline questionnaires did not perfectly align with the Rockwood CFS score descriptors and there was some subjectivity when selecting questions and responses to discriminate between CFS scores, which highlights limitations of retrospective derivation. However, we aimed to overcome this by developing a ‘best fit’ algorithm, recognising that mCFS is a proxy rather than a perfect measure of CFS, and used external review to help overcome individual bias. Further development of the mCFS algorithm through more rigorous methodology, such as a formal Delphi consensus study, may help to improve the validity of the measure. Whilst we do not know how well mCFS derived from the baseline questionnaires in this study correlates with clinician-assessed CFS in the clinic, there is some evidence demonstrating good inter-rater reliability between prospective and retrospective CFS assessment [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which supports the validity of the findings of this study. Whilst this study demonstrates the potential prognostic value of the simple CFS assessment, further study looking at the association between prospectively-assessed CFS and treatment outcome is required before CFS scores can be used to guide decision-making in the clinic, and publication of existing data from the SCFN pilot sites [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that have been collecting CFS in cancer settings could be valuable in this regard. A small prospective study looking at the agreement between mCFS and CFS could also be valuable.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0140">Frailty, identified by three derivable measures (G8, GO2FS and mCFS), correlates with poor Overall Treatment Utility, progression, and death in this cohort of older and frail younger patients with aGO cancer. Frailty measures add information over and above PS, adding weight to the argument that assessment of frailty should be integrated into routine clinical and research practice in oncology. The simple measure of CFS has predictive potential in this setting that is similar to other more complex tools, though prospective study is required to corroborate the findings of this study. We have demonstrated that frailty measures can be derived retrospectively from existing data, with the potential to help to build the evidence base around the optimal care of frailer patients in the absence of prospectively collected frailty measures.</p>
