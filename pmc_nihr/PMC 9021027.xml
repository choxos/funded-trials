                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Psychoeducation delivered face-to-face is effective in alleviating mental health morbidities in family carers of individuals with psychosis. However, research in such interventions delivered online is scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness of a digital multicomponent intervention—COPe-support—in improving carers' mental wellbeing and caregiving-related outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this two-arm, individually randomised, superiority trial, people aged 18 years or older who provided at least weekly support in any format for a relative or close friend affected by psychosis across England were randomly assigned (1:1) to either COPe-support or a passive online information resource using an independent online system. Participants were recruited through 30 mental health UK National Health Service trusts. The study team were masked to allocation and assessment of outcomes as all data collection took place online. Participants had access to either condition for 40 weeks and were advised to spend at least half an hour per week over the initial 20 weeks to go through materials at their own pace and to allow time to integrate knowledge and skills learned into practice. It was not feasible to mask participants or the online facilitator to intervention allocation. COPe-support provided psychoeducation on psychosis-related caregiving strategies and forums with professionals and other carers, and the control intervention comprised a passive online information resource. The primary outcome at 20 weeks was mental wellbeing measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS; minimally clinically important difference [MCID] 3). This trial is registered with ISRCTN, 89563420.</p>

                  <p>Between March 1, 2018, and Feb 14, 2020, 407 participants were randomly assigned, with 204 allocated to COPe-support and 203 allocated to control. The participants (mean age 53·1 years, SD 13·2) were mostly female (330 [81%] of 407 participants) and White (359 [88%] of 407 participants). 346 (85%) of 407 participants provided primary endpoint data, 174 (85%) of 204 participants in the COPe-support group and 172 (85%) of 203 participants in the control group. The mean WEMWBS score at 20 weeks was 44·5 (SD 8·31) for the COPe-support group and 43·3 (9·19) for the control group. We found no evidence of a difference in wellbeing between the two groups (adjusted mean difference 0·37, 95% CI –1·14 to 1·88; p=0·63). In the COPe-support group, 106 (52%) of 204 participants met the complier definition of a minimum of two logins in separate weeks. The complier average causal effect analysis increased the difference in WEMWBS scores (adjusted difference 0·83, 95% CI –1·45 to 3·11; p=0·47), but this was lower than the MCID. There were no adverse events.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">We did two systematic reviews at the outset of the trial in 2016, one focusing on psychoeducation interventions for family carers of individuals with psychosis or schizophrenia delivered using any medium, and the second focusing on interventions delivered via the internet. For both reviews, we searched ten databases that cover medical and health publications (MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, ASSIA, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, National Institute for Health Research—Health Technology Assessment database, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect, and NHS Economic Evaluation Database) and grey literature (ProQuest dissertations and theses) for studies published in English and Chinese from database inception to Dec 1, 2016. The search terms comprised subject headings, synonyms, and free-text search terms to identify (digital/e- or m-/web or internet-) psychoeducation interventions for family/informal/unpaid carer* for people affected by schizophreni* or psycho*. Searches were limited to randomised controlled trials. Through both reviews, we identified 32 randomised trials, including 2858 family carers; only one trial that reported an entirely digital intervention with 21 carers (and 31 patients) was identified. We did a meta-analysis, considering a range of mental health and caregiving-related outcomes. With relevance to this study, pooled results showed that psychoeducation, using a textual or face-to-face delivery format, was superior in reducing carers' global morbidities (standardised mean difference [SMD] –0·230), perceived burden (SMD –0·434), negative caregiving experiences (SMD –0·210), and expressed emotion (SMD –0·161), compared with usual care. Effects on carers' mental wellbeing were non-significant but data for this outcome were retrieved from just two trials and 184 participants. Only one trial investigated carers' quality of life as an outcome. The search that focused on trials of digital interventions targeting family carers was updated on Dec 20, 2020, identifying an additional trial investigating a digital self-management intervention that was facilitated by carer peer workers, but carers' mental wellbeing was not measured as an outcome. The search was updated on Aug 2, 2021, and the evidence base remains valid.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">To our knowledge, this is the first fully randomised trial to report the clinical efficacy of a digital psychoeducation intervention that provides quality health information and network support from professionals and carers as peers. This trial provides clear evidence that a multi-component psychoeducation intervention delivered entirely online is not effective in improving carers' mental wellbeing compared with a passive online information resource, at 20 weeks. There was a significant increase in mental health knowledge at 40 weeks in the intervention group. The trial was indicative of a small-to-moderate increase in wellbeing, quality of life, and positive caregiving experience, and a small reduction in negative caregiving experience and expressed emotion, at both 20 weeks and 40 weeks, but these changes were statistically non-significant. Effects on mental wellbeing at 20 weeks were greater in participants with higher use, although this finding was not significant. Study participant retention was high at 20 weeks and 40 weeks, with no adverse events or side-effects reported, indicating it is feasible to deliver psychoeducation safely via the internet.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Our study results suggest that a digital multicomponent psychoeducation intervention has no significant effect on carers' mental wellbeing and quality of life, outcomes that have long been under-researched in the field of psychoeducation intervention effectiveness. In terms of caregiving-related outcomes that are more commonly reported in existing trials, such as caregiving experience and expressed emotion, our digital intervention was no more effective than was the control intervention. Our trial did not measure morbidities such as depression, anxiety or distress, or perceived burden, for which a positive effect has been identified in systematic reviews on conventional psychoeducation interventions delivered to family carers. Participant recruitment, retention, and completion in the trial were satisfactory. Notwithstanding the need for good evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, the implication for policy is that digital psychoeducation intervention alone should not be commissioned for carers supporting an individual with psychosis with an expectation of a significant effect on mental wellbeing and other health outcomes. However, we note that participants' usage of the digital intervention—in particular, posting on interactive forums—was highly heterogeneous and, overall, far below the recommended weekly login for half an hour. Considering the projected increase in the size of the carer population, it is not possible to meet these needs in primary care or specialist mental health services without using the potential digital technologies offer. Further research to optimise the potential of digital technologies in delivering effective support, possibly adjunctive to professional-led and face-to-face services, including strategies to optimise engagement and increase usage, remains important.</p>

                <p id="para110">In this randomised trial, we used a two-arm, individually randomised, superiority design that compared COPe-support with a passive online information resource. We did an internal pilot trial to test the trial procedures, recruitment, and retention, that ran for the first 12 months of the 30-month trial duration. The pilot stop–go criteria were: to recruit at least a third of the sample size and to retain at least 80% of participants, with over 80% of them having activated their logins. A detailed trial protocol has been previously published.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> This study has been reviewed and approved by South Central—Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (reference 18/SC/0104) and the UK National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority (reference IRAS 240005).

We have eight patient, carer, and key stakeholder members among our 14-membered Project Reference Group, which oversaw the study design, identified the outcomes and measures used in the study, and supported the study delivery, data analysis, and dissemination of the study results.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para120">The trial included relatives and close friends aged 18 years or older who provided at least weekly support in any format for the cared-for person who had psychosis,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> had daily access to the internet including emails, and were able to communicate in English. Both the carers and the cared-for person were required to reside in England during the study period.

Participants had access to either condition for 40 weeks and were advised to spend at least half an hour per week over the initial 20 weeks to go through materials at their own pace and to allow time to integrate knowledge and skills learned into practice. An experienced mental health nurse (JSi) acted as the online facilitator who monitored and moderated all the interactive functions. The online facilitator sent weekly updates via the intervention announcement function, which generated an email automatically to participants to promote engagement. For security and anonymity, participants were required to follow ground rules, including the use of a self-chosen pseudonym and to not give any of their or their cared-for person's identifiable details on the platform.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>

In addition to a home page, which provided a menu, navigation video, and guide, the intervention comprised 12 sections. These included psychoeducation on psychosis, its treatment, and related caring issues; wellbeing promotion information and exercises; an ask the experts online forum, where participants could ask for advice from 14 experts, including multidisciplinary clinicians, welfare benefits advisors, and people using mental health services; a peer-to-peer forum, where participants could exchange views and support; a resources for carers section that provided extensive links to relevant external resources (eg, statutory and professional bodies, charities, books, and online information sites); and a support weblink, for participants to seek technical or emotional support if necessary. There was no prescribed order or sequence on the content; instead, participants were encouraged to pick the content specific to their own needs and caring situations. Participants were able to initiate posts and respond to both ask the experts and peer-to-peer forums or visit both forums passively (ie, reading posts).</p>
                <p id="para190">A web-based information resource run on a parallel Canvas platform acted as the control, which had an identical presentation and format to the COPe-support platform. The control platform comprised a home page, support function, and all the information provided under resources for carers in the COPe-support platform. There were no interactive elements included in the passive online information resource platform, similar to other information websites as the most common provision within wider usual care. To optimise retention, control group participants were given access to COPe-support for 20 weeks, after completing 40-week follow-up data collection.</p>

Criteria for the internal pilot were met and the trial steering committee approved the trial to progress. 407 participants completed baseline assessment and were randomly assigned, with 204 allocated to COPe-support and 203 allocated to control. The last participant completed their final visit on Oct 31, 2020. Four (2%) of 204 participants withdrew from the intervention group and six (3%) of 203 participants withdrew from the control group.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>A participant who missed a visit did not provide any data at the given timepoint; a participant who attended a visit was not required to have completed all outcome data.

The mean WEMWBS score for these participants at 20 weeks was 44·9, compared with 42·9 for the would-be compliers in the control group. The adjusted between-arm difference in WEMWBS score was 0·83 (95% CI –1·45 to 3·11; p=0·47), showing no evidence of a statistical difference between the study groups. The efficacy estimate was greater than the treatment policy estimand in favour of COPe-support, but not close to the MCID of 3. Post-hoc analyses using different complier definitions resulted in an estimated range of between-arm difference from 0·87 to 1·45, and the difference was greatest in those who had spent over 120 min on the COPe-support platform by 20 weeks (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).

              <p id="para410">In this study, among carers supporting an individual with psychosis, using COPe-support to provide web-based interactive psychoeducation and network support for 20 weeks did not significantly improve mental wellbeing compared with a passive online information resource. Similar results were found for all secondary outcomes at 20 weeks and 40 weeks, with the exception of stigma-related mental health knowledge, which reflected a more positive outlook on treatment effectiveness and on recovery. Although mental wellbeing and a range of caregiving-related and mental health outcomes improved among COPe-support participants, COPe-support was not superior to the control intervention.</p>
              <p id="para420">Our trial results echoed those of a study of an online self-management intervention facilitated by trained peer workers for carers of people with psychosis in England.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> We propose several potential explanations for the results. First, overall use of COPe-support was below our recommended weekly 30 mins of use for 20 weeks; we did anticipate participants' use would be heterogeneous and less than regular, depending on needs. Heterogeneous use and adherence has been frequently observed in digital mental health interventions, in particular in self-guided ones.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Although face-to-face psychosocial interventions commonly have in-built engagement sessions that have been shown to mediate therapeutic alliance, adherence, and effects,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> online interventions such as COPe-support might fall short in engagement with participants, relying solely on online communciations, and therefore hampering ongoing content delivery.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Our CACE analysis showed a greater effect in participants with higher use, but this difference was not significant. This finding raises the possibility that the absence of a significant effect could have been partly because of low or no minimally sufficient treatment dosage. However, there is insufficient research to indicate the required compliance threshold.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Second, although the effectiveness of face-to-face psychoeducational interventions in reducing psychological distress and burden is well established,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the pathways to positive effects on carer mental health remain unclear. Third, although participants reported feeling better supported through COPe-support, it is possible that they did not observe clinical improvement in the people they were caring for; therefore, their own outcomes did not change. Almost all the participants were recruited through mental health services, indicating that the carers were supporting an individual receiving care at the time of the study. This fact might imply that participants' need for support was high and beyond what COPe-support was designed for. Fourth, participants across groups had access to health information resources and usual care, potentially contributing to a larger control group effect. Previous conventional psychoeducational intervention trials commonly used waitlists or usual care as a comparator and so a tougher test of effect was applied in this study.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p id="para430">The strengths of this study were its large sample size, broad inclusion criteria that considered the varied nature of caregiving in psychosis (such as different relationships between carers and cared-for people and time spent on caregiving), a web-based active control group to reduce confounding factors inherent in technology or delivery medium, and use of methods designed to reduce the risk of bias, such as participant-reported outcome measures, statistical analysis done masked to allocation, intention-to-treat analyses, and a pre-registered statistical analysis plan. Our study did have some limitations. Our results might be more generalisable to individuals who are similar to the study sample, most of whom were women, White, and used internet communications regularly. We recruited carers as participants across England where, although health services share the same systems and clinical guidelines,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> variation in care and resources available for carers across areas does exist. Although the random assignment should have removed any allocation bias, we did not prespecify the areas in which carers or their cared-for people resided as a stratification factor. Similar to many other psychotherapy trials, participant masking was not possible, which might have led to bias by expectation, considering that all outcomes were self-reported.</p>
              <p id="para440">Psychoeducation, delivered as a group programme that facilitates exchanges of experiential knowledge and support between peers, is among the most effective interventions recommended for carers supporting an individual with psychosis.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Paradoxically, implementation of such interventions is limited. Self-guided digital interventions, such as COPe-support, offer full user autonomy and require minimal input from health-care professionals. A high proportion of carers remained engaged with the intervention for 40 weeks, with no adverse events reported over the 30-month study duration. These findings suggest that digital technology can be used effectively to meet carers' needs for psychoeducation and network support across a vast geographical area. Our study findings on improved stigma-related mental health knowledge among carers suggest that COPe-support might have had benefits in relation to knowledge rather than in relation to wellbeing and health; we will explore this hypothesis further in the qualitative analysis of participant interviews. Further research is also needed to explore the effects of peer workers or peer researchers instead of clinicians acting as online forum facilitators or study coordinators, in both usage of and nature of interactions. COPe-support, adapted with better digital engagement strategies that promote higher use and as an adjunct to some face-to-face support from local services, might have the potential to fill an important gap in delivering high-quality psychoeducation to carers. Considering the strong association between carers' own wellbeing and their caring capacity, which inevitably affect the recovery of the person they care for,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> interventions targeting carers, as both users and providers of care, can have far-reaching effects. Furthermore, with the implementation of digital interventions, accelerated in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to overcome face-to-face contact restrictions, further research is warranted to investigate strategies to optimise use and effects of carer-focused digital interventions. With the projected increase in the carer population, many of whom are unable to attend or have no access to in-person interventions, it is not possible to meet these needs in primary care or specialist mental health services without exploiting the potential of digital technologies.</p>
              <p id="para450">In conclusion, our results show that for carers supporting an individual with psychosis, COPe-support providing online psychoeducation and support from professionals and peers was not superior to a high-quality passive information resource in improving mental wellbeing at 20 weeks. Our findings do not support the use of COPe-support in its current format rather than a passive online information resource. Considering the projected increase in the carer population and demand for support, delivering evidence-based interventions via the internet adjunctive to face-to-face services remains a potentially viable option.</p>
