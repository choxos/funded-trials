              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends hemiarthroplasty as the procedure of choice for the treatment of displaced intracapsular fractures when patients are not eligible for total hip replacement and recommends that hemiarthroplasties are carried out using a lateral approach rather than a conventional posterior approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Some studies report dislocation in up to 10% of patients using the standard posterior approach and such complications can lead to catastrophic consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To address the issue of instability leading to dislocation, modifications in the surgical approaches have been attempted using minimally invasive and muscle-sparing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2016, the Hip Unit at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust developed a modified technique using a posterior approach, named “SPAIRE”; “Save Piriformis and Internus, Repairing Externus”.

                <title>Brief study overview</title>
                <p id="Par26">The HemiSPAIRE trial is a definitive, pragmatic, superiority, randomised controlled trial (with internal pilot) with two parallel groups and blinded assessment. The study population is adults aged 60 years or older attending one of six hospital sites in the South West of England, with a displaced intracapsular fracture requiring hip hemiarthroplasty. All patients requiring hemiarthroplasty for a displaced intracapsular hip fracture were considered for inclusion. In order to be included in the study, patients had to be residents in the South West of England. Patients who were unable to walk before hip fracture, and/or were not expected to live until 120 days after their operation (post-operative day 120 (POD 120)) and/or for whom a femoral stem not of a proven stem design (in line with NICE clinical guidance on hip fracture management) would be used, were not eligible to take part in the study.</p>
                <p id="Par27">A total of 244 patients were recruited between November 2019 and April 2022 and randomised in a 1:1 ratio, in theatre, to have their operation performed either using the SPAIRE or the lateral surgical approach. Randomisation was stratified by hospital site and by cognition level (impaired vs non-impaired) from information gathered by the research nurse in the patient’s records. Data collection took place at screening in order to determine eligibility, at baseline (pre-surgery), at 3 days after surgery (POD 3) and at 120 days after surgery (POD 120). Full details of the trial background and rationale, design and sample size calculation have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

Secondary objectives are to (1) test whether the SPAIRE technique results in improved early function, mobility and pain, pain and quality of life at 120 days, length of hospital stay and complication rates and mortality up to 120 days following surgery compared to the standard lateral approach, through collecting secondary outcome measures; (2) investigate how patients experience the recovery period after surgery, and investigate mechanisms of recovery, including experience of post-operative pain and engagement in physiotherapy, which may contribute to any differences between trial arms, by conducting a qualitative study with a sub-sample of patients in each trial arm; and (3) work with patients and carers with relevant lived experience to ensure the conduct and outputs of the study are relevant and useful to patients who receive hemiarthroplasty surgery.

The trial is powered to detect a difference between allocated trial arms in the OHS of 5 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with 90% power and a two-sided type 1 error rate of 0.05, assuming the standard deviation (SD) of the OHS is 10. The total loss to follow-up was originally estimated to be 25%, giving a total recruitment target of 228 participants. Following monitoring of follow-up rates by the trial team during the trial, this rate was revised to 30%, resulting in an updated recruitment target of 244 participants. The OHS gives a total score between 0 and 48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and, due to COVID-19 restrictions at the time of this study, is collected over the phone by research nurses.

Adherence will be assessed based on the percentage of operations that were performed using the approach that was allocated at randomisation, and percentage of follow-up assessments that were completed within the pre-specified data collection windows. All deviations from the study protocol will be reported. The number of participants with protocol deviations will be reported descriptively by trial arm. The pre-specified data collection window for the early post-operative follow-up is POD 3 or POD 4. For the POD 120 follow-up, the data collection window is between POD 110 and 130.</p>

                <p id="Par52">Where participants have missing data on a subset of items for a given measure a decision will be made on the minimum number of items that should be responded to for a total score to be obtained. This will be done in advance of the database being locked and blind to the knowledge of which arm the participants are allocated to. Any measure-specific rules for obtaining total scores when items are missing will be used. Specifically, for the primary outcome OHS, if one or two items are missing these will be replaced with the mean of the remaining items, and a total score calculated. If more than two items are missing, a total score will not be calculated and that participant will not be included in the main analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par53">The main analyses will be based on complete case data. Additional analyses will be carried out for all outcomes, based on multiple imputation. Multiple imputation will be used to impute missing data on outcomes, under the assumption that data are missing at random according to Rubin’s rules, i.e. that missingness is accounted for by other variables within the dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Missing data will be imputed using the chained equation approach. Predictive mean matching, in which imputed values are sampled only from the observed values, will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A total of 50 imputed datasets will be generated. Variables used to impute missing data will include all outcomes at all follow-up time points, trial arm status, stratification variables, and variables included as adjustment factors in the regression models fitted to outcomes. While all participants will be included in the imputation process, no outcomes will be imputed for participants who die before the outcome could have been assessed. That is, if a participant dies before POD 3, no outcomes will be imputed for that participant; if a participant dies between POD 3 and POD 120, POD 3 outcomes will be imputed if missing; if a participant survives beyond the POD 120 follow-up all missing outcomes will be imputed. Note: this principle is used in the process of obtaining multiple imputed datasets but does not apply to the <italic>composite</italic> approach used in additional analyses, described later in this article, in which those participants who have died before the outcome can be assessed are given a ‘worst case’ score for that outcome.</p>

                <title>Planned main analysis of the primary outcome</title>
                <p id="Par58">The primary outcome (OHS) was originally going to be analysed using linear regression. Review of trial data by the Trial Steering Committee identified differential survival between trial arms. Consequently, it was agreed that planned analysis of the primary outcome (OHS) will use a survivor average causal effect (SACE) approach, which allows estimation of the effect of surgical approach on outcomes in the population of people who would have survived regardless of what surgical approach they received. The method of principal stratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] will be used, which assumes that the survival status for each participant allocated to SPAIRE, D(S) or to lateral, D(L), are conditionally independent given a set of baseline covariates (X), which are predictive of survival. It also assumes that conditional on a participant surviving when randomised to SPAIRE, and the covariates, their survival status under lateral is independent of the outcome Y(SPAIRE) and vice versa (swapping SPAIRE and lateral). The effect of surgical approach can then be estimated by following the steps outlined below:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par59">Fit a logistic regression model in those randomised to SPAIRE where survival = 1 and death = 0, with X as covariates.

                <p id="Par62">Steps a and b are performed once, to obtain the weights. These weights are then used in step c), which is performed for each outcome.</p>
                <p id="Par63">The set of baseline covariates X that will be used in steps a and b are gender, age, cognitive impairment, place of residence and co-morbidities (ASA score), all known to be predictive of survival in this patient group and currently used in the Nottingham Hip Fracture Score model to provide surgeons with the ability to calculate a mortality risk online for their patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The remaining baseline variable that is collected in the trial is ethnicity, and this will be explored as a possible predictor for inclusion.</p>

                <p id="Par65">Secondary outcomes were originally going to be analysed using linear (continuous outcomes), or logistic (binary outcomes) regression. As described above for the OHS, following the identification of differential survival between trial arms, secondary outcomes (excluding surgical complications and mortality) will be analysed using the SACE method, as described above. In step c of the approach, continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed in the same way as the OHS. The binary secondary outcomes of discharge destination (i.e. whether the same as pre-fracture place of residence) and place of residence at 120 days (i.e. whether the same as pre-fracture place of residence) will be compared between trial arms using weighted logistic regression. For each of these outcomes, the number of events will be checked when considering adjustment factors to be included in the analyses, additional to the trial arm.</p>
                <p id="Par66">Frequencies of surgical complications within 120 days follow-up will be presented by type, in the two trial arms (i.e. the number of participants in each arm who have each type of complication, the three most common expected complications being: dislocations, peri-prosthetic fractures and infections). Kaplan Meier plots will be used to show these events (either complications of all types, or separated by type, depending on the numbers of complications occurring) in the two trial arms and to visually check the assumption of proportional hazards. If there is no clear evidence of non-proportional hazards, and sufficient numbers of complications in the two arms to warrant formal comparison, Cox regression will be used to analyse time to the first complication. Censored participants will be those who are lost to follow-up, who drop out, die, or reach 120 days before having a complication.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par82">The article reporting the protocol for this randomised controlled trial included a brief outline of the planned statistical analyses, which were subsequently further developed and modified after the start of the trial. This detailed statistical analysis plan was written during the delivery period of the HemiSPAIRE trial and was finalised prior to final data collection.</p>
              <p id="Par83">By publishing our detailed statistical analysis plan for a randomised controlled trial of a surgical intervention in an older population, we hope that it may be of use to other teams developing plans for similar trials, with similar considerations to be made, particularly regarding comparing outcomes between groups where there might be differential survival or a significant risk that participants do not survive to, or are not able to be assessed at, the primary follow-up time point.</p>
