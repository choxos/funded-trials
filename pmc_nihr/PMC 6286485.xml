                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The course of Crohn’s disease (CD) varies substantially between individuals, but reliable prognostic markers do not exist. This hinders disease management because patients with aggressive disease are undertreated by conventional ‘step-up’ therapy (in which treatment is gradually escalated in response to refractory or relapsing disease) while those with more indolent disease would be exposed to unnecessary treatment-related toxicity if a more aggressive ‘top-down’ approach was indiscriminately used. The Predicting outcomes for Crohn’s disease using a molecular biomarker trial will assess whether a prognostic transcriptional biomarker, that we have developed and validated, can improve clinical outcomes by facilitating personalised therapy in CD. This represents the first the biomarker-stratified trial in inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This biomarker-stratified trial will compare the relative efficacy of ‘top-down’ and ‘accelerated step-up’ therapy between biomarker-defined subgroups of patients with newly diagnosed CD. 400 participants from ~50 UK centres will be recruited. Subjects within each biomarker subgroup (IBD<sup>hi</sup> or IBD<sup>lo</sup>) will be randomised (1:1) to receive one of the treatment strategies until trial completion (48 weeks). The primary outcome is the incidence of sustained surgery and steroid-free remission from the completion of induction treatment through to week 48. Secondary outcomes include mucosal healing, quality-of-life assessments and surrogate measures of disease burden including number of flares, cumulative steroid exposure, number of hospital admissions and number of Crohn’s-related surgeries (assessed hierarchically). Analyses will compare the relative benefit of the treatment strategies in each biomarker-defined subgroup, powered as an interaction analysis, to determine whether the biomarker can accurately match patients to the most appropriate therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Crohn’s disease (CD) is a relapsing-remitting form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect any part of the intestine, most commonly the ileum and/or colon. It is a common condition, affecting ~1 in 400–500 people in Northwestern Europe and North America, with a steadily rising global incidence.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref>
</p>
              <p>Like many other immune-mediated diseases, the course of CD varies substantially between affected individuals, but no reliable prognostic markers currently exist. The most common treatment strategy in CD is therefore based on a reactive, stepwise escalation in therapy that occurs in response to recurrent flares or persistently active disease. This approach (termed ‘step-up’) should not overtreat patients but will inevitably expose some individuals to cumulative intestinal damage and disease-related complications while therapies that are insufficiently potent for them are trialled.</p>
              <p>In 2008, it was shown that early use of anti-tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) monoclonal antibodies (anti-TNFα therapy) was superior to conventional step-up management.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Further support for early anti-TNFα use came from registration trials, which demonstrated greater efficacy of anti-TNFα therapy when it was used earlier in the disease course<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref>; and the SONIC trial, which showed that combining anti-TNFα (infliximab) with azathioprine (termed combination or ‘top-down’ therapy) achieved results superior to either alone.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, it is widely recognised that the indiscriminate use of combination therapy in all patients would expose those patients destined for mild disease to the risks and side-effects of treatment that their disease did not require, and would also be economically unfeasible.</p>
              <p>In an attempt to reconcile these issues, subsequent trials have sought to identify approaches that could still deliver relatively early, aggressive therapy but also be economically feasible. The Randomised Evaluation of an Algorithm for Crohn’s Treatment (REACT) trial, for example, investigated whether accelerating more quickly up the treatment ladder (‘accelerated step-up’) would lead to better outcomes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Similarly, the AZathioprine for Treatment or Early Crohn’s disease in adults (AZTEC) and Résultat de l’Adjonction Précoce d’ImmunoDépresseurs (RAPID) trials investigated whether initiating azathioprine, a less potent but cheaper immunomodulator, in all patients at diagnosis would improve outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> However, none of these studies have demonstrated improved efficacy over standard care, leading many to conclude that a ‘precision’ (or ‘personalised’) approach would be required in which the most potent treatments are targeted to those who need them. Unfortunately, despite investigation into the prognostic utility of clinical, genetic and serological markers, there remain no well-validated prognostic tools for CD that can reliably predict the disease course from diagnosis. Indeed, a recent priority setting partnership group, tasked with identifying major areas of unmet need in IBD research, designated the need to develop markers to guide treatment for individual patients as the most important unmet need in IBD.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Consistent with this, a survey of 52 US and 50 UK gastroenterologists (commissioned through Apex Healthcare Consulting) showed that nearly all gastroenterologists recognised a need for an assay that could predict the clinical outcome and probability of relapse in CD (UK 98%, US 94%; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Moreover, if the results of such a biomarker enabled gastroenterologists to amend their treatment approach, all of the respondents would use the test in their practice (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

              <p>Our group has previously identified a gene expression signature in peripheral blood CD8 +T cells from patients with active, untreated IBD (and other autoimmune diseases) that is related to T cell exhaustion and which correlates with subsequent prognosis.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> Patients in the IBD1 subgroup, defined by this signature, had a much more aggressive disease than those in the IBD2 subgroup, with earlier recurrence of disease and more flares over time.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> To help translate this to routine clinical practice, we have since developed a whole blood qPCR assay that can identify patient subgroups which are analogous to those identified by the CD8 signature, but which does not require cell separation (manuscript in preparation). This assay has been independently validated in prospectively-collected cohorts of UC and CD patients from four centres around the UK.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We now propose to conduct a biomarker-stratified trial to determine whether this biomarker can facilitate the delivery of personalised medicine in CD and improve outcomes.</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p>The PROFILE trial will test whether stratification using a whole blood gene expression biomarker can facilitate personalised therapy in CD and improve clinical outcomes. The hypothesis is that the biomarker will identify individuals destined to run an aggressive, relapsing course, and that in these individuals a greater benefit of early top-down therapy will be observed. Similarly, we hypothesise that the biomarker will reliably identify those patients destined to experience more indolent disease, who can be effectively managed using conventional accelerated step-up approaches without the risks and side-effects of unnecessary immunosuppression.</p>
                <p>In addition, the trial will seek to advance scientific understanding of CD through the collection of a range of biological samples for future exploratory translational and scientific studies. These will include microbial, metabolomic, proteomic, genetic and transcriptomic samples.</p>

                  <p>Newly diagnosed patients with CD will be recruited from a predominantly outpatient setting. Potential trial patients will be identified by local clinical team members and be given a PIS prior to attending a screening visit. All participants must have had a colonoscopy before screening, where possible recorded for central reading. A magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) to stage disease in accordance with European consensus guidelines<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> is also required but can be performed after trial entry.</p>
                  <p>Assessments, data collection and obtaining informed consent will be performed by appropriately trained research staff, as delegated by the principal investigator at each site. At trial visits, clinical data will be collected as well as samples for local and central processing—collection, evaluation and storage of these samples are outlined in the full trial protocol. Participants receiving infliximab should have infusion visits aligned with trial visits, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, to reduce visit burden and the placebo effect associated with extra visits.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Following their final trial visit, participants will return to normal standard of care, according to local clinical practice.</p>

This was based on previously published remission rates for the primary endpoint,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 7</xref> the observed ratio of the IBD<sup>hi</sup>/IBD<sup>lo</sup> biomarker result in existing cohorts (1:1) and the observed remission rates in each of these cohorts.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

                  <title>Statistical procedures and data analysis plan</title>
                  <p>The primary analysis is powered as an interaction analysis, where the interaction refers to the difference between the relative benefit of top-down over accelerated step-up in each subgroup. This analytical strategy maximises the information available from each subgroup, and will determine whether the biomarker can accurately match patients to the most appropriate treatment strategy. Assuming an interaction of 0.3, a sample size of 346 will provide 90% power (estimated with 95% CIs and tested at a two-tailed, 5% significance level). To allow for a~13.5% drop out rate, 400 participants will be recruited across approximately 50 sites. This will require recruitment of ~4 participants per site per year, which is a rate consistent with previous recruitment to investigator-led IBD studies in the UK.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Recruitment began in December 2017.</p>
                  <p>To control for multiple testing, we will perform a closed testing procedure over the primary and six secondary endpoints, testing the biomarker–treatment interaction. A well-described methodology combining gate-keeping and Holm-Bonferroni methods in formal hypothesis testing will be used,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> as outlined in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 1</xref>. The secondary outcome measures will include an endoscopic assessment of mucosal healing (in addition to further analyses using MRE data), a quality-of-life assessment and a third outcome measure related to overall burden of disease (this hierarchically includes number of flares, cumulative steroid exposure, number of hospital admissions and number of Crohn’s-related surgeries).</p>

                  <p>Mucosal healing has been associated with improved long-term outcomes in CD.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> The use of central reading, in which the endoscopic images or video recordings are externally evaluated, has been further associated with a reduction in placebo response rates,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> in part due to more stringent application of inclusion criteria and assessment of endoscopic response.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The PROFILE trial will use video recording of colonoscopy at the end of the trial period in all patients and at the outset in as many patients as possible, using the SES-CD,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> a scoring tool that has been shown to have high inter-rater and intrarater reliability.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> To date, many trials using endoscopic endpoints have applied <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses in small cohorts, resulting in limited power to detect effects.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In this respect, the PROFILE trial will be one of the largest trials to analyse mucosal healing routinely and the first to do so in the setting of adults with CD treated with top-down therapy from diagnosis.</p>
                  <p>An MRE will be performed at the end of the trial period in all patients. There is increasing interest in the use of MRE as a measure of disease activity in clinical trials, with the development of imaging scores such as the Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> This, and other similar scores, have often been validated and refined in relatively small cohorts<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and none are in routine clinical use. With 400 participants, the PROFILE trial will enable further evaluation of the MaRIA score both in terms of confirming treatment response and as an evaluative index.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</p>
                  <p>Quality-of-life assessments will be performed over repeated visits and will be analysed using a mixed effect repeat measure analysis with a clustered patient-level residual error with unstructured covariance over visits, fixed effects for visit and all other covariates assumed to have a constant fixed effect over time.</p>
                  <p>It is anticipated that future data collection will also take place following completion of treatment to assess disease burden and the longer term impact of top-down versus accelerated step-up treatment approaches on subsequent disease course for these patients.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Currently, there is a clear unmet need in the management of IBD, in that treatment strategies—whatever they may be—are typically applied in a one-size-fits-all manner or using ‘prognostic’ markers that have not been shown to be able to guide therapy.</p>
              <p>The PROFILE trial is the first biomarker-stratified trial in IBD and will investigate whether a blood-based biomarker, assessed at diagnosis, can stratify patients with CD to receive therapy that is appropriately matched to their subsequent disease course.</p>
              <p>If stratification by IBD<sup>hi</sup>/IBD<sup>lo</sup> status is demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes by appropriately identifying those patients who require top-down therapy and those who can be safely managed with accelerated step-up therapy, this would represent a step change in the management of CD and would help make personalised medicine a reality for patients.</p>

                <p>Recruitment for the PROFILE trial began in December 2017 and is currently ongoing at sites around the United Kingdom. On completion of the trial, the data will be analysed and tabulated and a final trial report prepared. Following trial completion and analysis, the results will be presented at scientific meetings and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Press releases will be prepared to accompany publication of this trial in order to share the results more widely with the global medical community, trial participants and patient support groups. Reasonable applications for individual clinical trial participant-level data will be considered by the trial team and shared on a controlled access basis if approved. Authorship of final trial outputs will be assigned in accordance with guidelines set out by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials reporting guidelines have been used in preparation of this article.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
