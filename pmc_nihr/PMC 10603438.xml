                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>People aged 16–24 are more likely than other age groups to acquire sexually transmitted infections (STI). Safetxt was a randomised controlled trial of a theory-based digital health intervention to reduce STIs among 16–24 year-old people in the UK. We report results of qualitative research regarding participants’ perceptions and experiences of the intervention and trial participation.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Qualitative thematic analysis following a critical realist paradigm of written open feedback comments provided in the 12-month follow-up questionnaire and semistructured interviews.</p>

                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>Safetxt trial participants were recruited from UK sexual health clinics.</p>

                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Trial inclusion criteria: people aged 16–24 diagnosed with or treated for chlamydia, gonorrhoea or non-specific urethritis. Optional open feedback provided by 3526 of 6248 safetxt participants at 12 months and interviews with a purposive sample of 18 participants after the trial.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We summarise and report results in seven broad themes. According to recipients, the safetxt intervention increased awareness of the importance of avoiding STIs and ways to prevent them. Participants reported improved confidence, agency, sexual well-being and communication about sexual health with partners, friends and family. Recipients attributed increased condom use, increased STI testing after (rather than before) sex with new partners, and more confident partner notification to the intervention. Recipients described a reduced sense of isolation and stigma in having an STI. Control group participants reported that having had an STI and receiving control texts asking them to report any changes in contact details acted as reminders to use condoms and get tested. We also summarise participant recommendations for future interventions and studies.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>While control group participants reported precautionary behaviours were ‘triggered’ by trial participation, intervention recipients reported additional benefits of the intervention in increasing precautionary behaviours and in broader aspects of sexual health such as confidence, communication, emotional well-being and agency.</p>

              <p>Sexual and reproductive health is defined by WHO as ‘a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to all aspects of sexuality and reproduction, not merely absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity'.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In terms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), younger people aged 16–24 bear the heaviest burden of chlamydia and gonorrhoea with long-term adverse health effects including ectopic pregnancy and subfertility.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> Inequalities in sexual health persist; STIs are positively associated with lower educational levels and living in more deprived areas.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 5–7</xref> High STI rates among young people also reflect broader aspects of poor sexual health, such as lack of knowledge, skills or confidence in how to carry out safer sex behaviours and how to communicate with partners about sex and desired precautions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>We developed the safetxt intervention delivered by text message to reduce STI infection by increasing condom use, partner notification and STI testing before sex with new partners.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The intervention development was informed by behaviour change theory,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> including the ‘capability, opportunity and motivation model of behaviour’ (COM).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This model is incorporated into the comprehensive ‘behaviour change wheel’ model, which aims to capture the full range of intervention functions involved in behaviour change; these include education, persuasion, environmental restructuring (encouraging people to change their environment to support the behaviour), training and enablement. Each intervention function can be implemented by a wide range of evidence-based behaviour change techniques.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the case of sexual behaviour, knowledge, skills, beliefs, self-efficacy, and social and interpersonal influences have important effects on COM.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 12</xref> Our intervention aimed to influence these factors to reduce sexual risk behaviour and encourage STI preventive behaviour.</p>

              <p>To shed further light on this, we analysed and triangulated qualitative data from two sources, including open feedback from the last follow-up questionnaires at the end of the trial (at 12 months)<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and semistructured interviews conducted after 12 months. In this paper, we present and discuss qualitative data on participant perceptions of the safetxt intervention and of 12 months trial participation with a view to exploring for whom, how and why the intervention worked or not and what improvements could be made in the future.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>We conducted qualitative research (as part of a mixed-methods approach integrated through an advanced intervention framework with embedded methods and narrative staged reporting<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) including the analysis of open feedback comments collected in the 12-month questionnaire<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> of the safetxt trial and semistructured qualitative interviews with participants after completing their involvement in the trial. The research team members are mixed-methods researchers within the areas of sexual and reproductive health. During the research, we followed a ‘critical realist’ (CR) paradigm,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> as in terms of ontology, epistemology and methodology we position ourselves in the middle of a continuum between positivism, naïve realism and objectivism<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref> on the one hand and interpretivism, relativism and constructionism<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> on the other. According to CR, there is a reality that exists independent of our thoughts about it, and while we can become more confident about what exists by observing, existence itself is not dependent on observation. CR also sees the social world as layered, complex and an open system and characterised by change. CRs often try to answer the question ‘what works for whom, when and why?’ and are typically pragmatic in their approach to methodology and methods.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 26</xref></p>
              <p>Below, we provide details on the two data sources used for our qualitative analysis.</p>
              <sec id="s2-1">
                <title>Data source 1: free-text comments</title>
                <p>The final page of the 12-month questionnaire given to all trial participants (who had provided written informed consent on enrolment) included an open-ended question: ‘Did anything good or bad happen as a result of being involved in the study or receiving the text messages? Please describe’. This question was followed by a blank space that participants had the option of completing themselves.</p>
                <p>Two researchers (AG and SB), who had not been involved in the design, implementation and quantitative evaluation of the intervention, independently coded the free-text comments and categorised data by theme, using Excel 2019 and NVivo v.12 respectively. AG and SB initially took a purposive sample of 12% (n=390) of free-text comments. They ensured that participants from different gender and sexuality groups were represented (by adding random samples of comments from each group) and included all comments from participants reporting that someone else had read their messages or reporting partner violence. This was to ensure that the feedback from participants who might have experienced unforeseen intervention side effects was coded in detail. AG and SB then independently coded these comments inductively line-by-line, considering all content (almost all of it was relevant to our research question). They then collated codes into potential themes and compared these to check for consistency of analysis and to reduce the risk of imposing own assumptions and predefined theories onto participants’ narratives. Subsequently, AG and SB independently analysed all remaining free-text comments, thereby adding newly generated themes, reviewing and naming themes. AG and SB then compared their findings again (which were consistent) and discussed them within the team. The findings were compared with data from the semi-structured interviews (data source 2).</p>

                <title>Data source 2: semistructured interviews</title>
                <p>We purposively recruited from safetxt participants based on trial allocation and sociodemographic characteristics (age, sexuality, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation) to encompass a variety of experiences. Eligible were participants who indicated during trial follow-up that they agreed to be contacted for further research. We sent text messages about the interview study to those who had recently (&lt;6 months) completed trial follow-up. AG and SB then approached and provided verbal and written information to those who were interested in the study.</p>
                <p>After receiving written informed consent, SB and AG conducted interviews by video conferencing (including Teams, Zoom or WhatsApp) or telephone. We initially focused on the recruitment of intervention participants and found that after 14 interviews data saturation for key themes relevant to our research question regarding the intervention had been reached (based on reflective notes, concurrent data analysis, triangulation with results of open feedback analysis and team discussions). After completing four interviews with control group participants, we had to stop study activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related personal circumstances and were unable to resume the work at a later stage as funding could not be extended.</p>
                <p>Interviews lasted between 30 and 90 min (average about 60 min). The interviewers (AG and SB, both female) introduced themselves as public health researchers who had not been involved in the design of the safetxt trial. Both kept reflective journals throughout the research process and engaged in self-reflexivity not only during interviews, but also during analysis to recognise and avoid imposing own assumptions and predefined theories onto participants’ narratives.</p>
                <p>The interviews followed a semistructured topic guide, which aimed to explore participants’ experiences regarding trial participation, whether or not they had been able to carry out the behaviours targeted by the intervention, and (for those from the intervention group) the intervention and how and why the messages did or did not help. We first explored which intervention messages participants recalled without being prompted. We then showed, sent or read to participants some of the messages and asked which, if any, they found particularly helpful or not. We also asked participants to make suggestions for improvements of the interventions. (Topic guides and example intervention messages in <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 2</xref>). New topics not included in the guide were further explored during subsequent interviews. These topics and summaries of reflective field notes were also discussed with RF and/or CF during team meetings.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service (bound to a confidentiality agreement), and reviewed for anonymity and accuracy of transcription by SB and AG, while listening to the audiorecordings. This was also part of the first step of the thematic analysis approach that we used, including (1) familiarising ourselves with the data, (2) generating initial codes, (3) searching for themes, (4) defining and naming themes and (5) producing the report.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This process was iterative as analyses were conducted alongside data collection. During the early stages, SB and AG first independently developed thematic codes from the same four interview transcripts, two of which were also coded by RF, to ensure consistency of coding. Thereafter, SB and AG independently coded their interview transcripts and categorised data by theme using NVivo v.12 and Microsoft Word 2019, respectively. At the later stages of thematic analysis, Microsoft Word 2019 was used to integrate and triangulate themes developed by both researchers from both data sources, based on comparisons and team discussions. During analysis meetings with the research team, results from open feedback comments (source 1) and interviews (source 2) were triangulated with quantitative trial data (including primary, secondary and intermediate outcomes)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> and data from telephone interviews conducted as part of the 2013 feasibility trial 2–3 weeks after starting messages<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> looking for consistencies and inconsistencies across the different data sources and searching for deviant cases.</p>

                <p>Patients and members of the public were involved in all phases of the safetxt intervention development and trial, including part of the qualitative components of the safetxt evaluation reported here. Prior to development of the safetxt intervention, possible safer sex interventions were discussed with young people in five discussion groups (25 participants). Subsequently, patients who participated in formal focus group discussions, helped to design the content of the intervention,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and a patient representative was included in the trial steering committee. In addition, 14 patient representatives from the King’s College Hospital Sexual and Reproductive Health user group helped design the patient information, consent and follow-up procedures and all trial questionnaires, including the open feedback question. Due to time restrictions, we did not seek help from patients for the design and pilot-testing of the interview topic guides, but instead gained input from four young colleagues. After the interviews, most participants indicated that they would be happy to help with the dissemination of results once published.</p>

              <p>About 27% (intervention: 24%, control: 29%) of those who provided open feedback on whether anything good or bad had happened (see the Methods section for exact question) merely stated ‘no’, ‘n/a’, ‘don’t know’, ‘nothing’, ‘neutral’, ‘no difference’ or a brief statement saying either they were unsure or did not notice any change as a result of participating in the study, for example, ‘I carried on as usual, nothing good or bad happened’. A further 3% of comments from control group participants merely stated that they were in the control group or did not receive any intervention messages or similar. The remaining free text comments (intervention: 76%, control: 70%) provided another free text response (beyond the aforementioned statements) that was generally mostly only a few sentences long, with some participants providing longer feedback (8% of intervention and 5% of control group comments were &gt;50 words long).</p>
              <p>We completed 18 interviews between February and May 2020. Respondent characteristics are in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>. Open feedback was overwhelmingly positive both about the intervention text messages and being in the trial. Many intervention and control group participants commented on the usefulness and convenience of having an STI test kit sent to their home for primary outcome assessment. Intervention group participants commented positively on the tone of the intervention text messages finding them friendly, reassuring, helpful and written in a non-judgmental manner. Participants also found that mobile phone delivery was a trusted, appropriate and convenient way to access information. Conversely, a few people in open feedback had concerns about keeping their messages private or reported that messages were annoying and many in both, the intervention and control arm, indicated that there was no change and nothing good or bad had happened as a result of being in the study.</p>

I put my health first rather than pleasing others or being irresponsible. You enjoy it more when you control the controllable and prevent any problems for the future.’ (23, WSM, OF)</p>

                  <p>‘My partner asked if we can ditch the condom, but I didn’t know how to say to him I don't want to. So I just nonchalantly showed him the message, pretending I just got a message and the message happened to be about condoms.’ (22, WSM, OF)</p>
                  <p>‘The texts were a reminder to take better care of myself, something to refer to if I felt reckless. Whilst having sexual contact with someone they slipped their penis inside me for a few seconds without a condom+I made him stop due to the risks whereas previously I wouldn’t have objected.' (23, WSM, OF)</p>
                  <p>‘Although I, myself did not use protection due to only being with my long term partner. This study has helped me pass on vital info to my friends to make sure they stay safe when sleeping with multiple people.’ (18, WSM, OF)</p>

                  <p>‘The text study was really helpful and insightful it helped me to be able to tell my sexual partner that I had been given a positive result for chlamydia and it helped me understand how to speak to him and tell him.’ (23, WSM, intervention, OF)</p>

                <p>‘I have been a lot more insistent of using condoms during sex. This could have been due to contracting chlamydia last summer which was treated and not wanting to get it again. I was part of the placebo group in the study but still got a text every month or so to keep my details updated. This made me thought of the study so could have reminded me anyway.’ (21, WSM, OF)</p>
                <p>‘I guess I’ve been more inclined to use condoms and have less unprotected sex as a screening was always in the back of my mind.’ (24, MSM, OF)</p>
                <p>‘Made me more aware of my sexual health by receiving the texts, it was almost like a reminder as sometimes sexual health can be at the back of your mind whereas when receiving the texts it was like a reminder and kept it at the forefront of your mind’ (18, WSM, OF)</p>
                <p>‘…receiving these texts made me feel good about taking steps towards being more aware and a part of something bigger that helped me be a better adult (18, MSM, OF)</p>
                <p>‘I didn't receive many messages. However, I became more conscious of my sexual health. I take precautions when I remember although, I haven't always used anything. I have been more conscious of sleeping with new people I don't know that well and have avoided this. (19, WSM, OF)</p>
                <p>‘I was sort of more wary about who I slept with, it’s like I didn’t sleep with as many people that I was before, I don’t know if that was just because of my age or if… I don’t know.(…) Like I went through a bit of a rough patch when I was younger and I feel like that sort of did include sleeping around a bit more and then I came out of it(…) and I was more like, I didn’t want to just sleep with anyone, I was sort of more picky.(…)</p>
                <p>I feel like it did play a little role [<italic toggle="yes">joining the study</italic>), like agreeing to be part of the safetxt I think was like a turning point as well in its own right. (21, WSM, I)</p>
                <p>‘Through the whole process of being diagnosed with an STI has made me consider my life choices. … I am reluctant to have a ‘one-night stand’ as I have previously experienced the consequences of unprotected sex with unfamiliar people. Overall, I have thought more about my actions, not so much as a result of the texts I receive, but instead because of what has happened with my health.’ (19, MSW, OF)</p>
                <p>‘I was made far more aware of how unsafe I was being, when in the past I would make more decisions in the moment which were unsafe and unthoughtful about the consequences. Having regular texts made me far more conscious about safe sex—it was a great reminder; as it is easy to forget.’ (19, WSM, OF)</p>
                <p>‘… I was in the group that didn’t receive texts about safe sex, however just being involved in the study and completing the questionnaires gave me a greater awareness of the benefits of practicing safe sex even after the shock from my initial diagnosis wore off… (18, WSM, OF)</p>
                <p>‘Made me more cautious of who to sleep with. Due to constant reminders.’ (19, MSW, OF)</p>
                <p>‘The only kind of messages I was receiving were the ones about confirming my address and contact information. In spite of that, I was still more aware to be cautious and ask people if they were getting tested etc.’ (19, MSM, OF)</p>
                <p>‘Has made me think to not have unprotected sex with a new person. I also feel happier…not having to feel embarrassed if I did have an STI.’ (18, MSW, OF)</p>
                <p>‘If I hadn't been part of the study I would not think to get tested as often…. or think to ask about whether my partner has been tested recently.’ (22, WSM, OF)</p>

                <title>Knowledge and awareness of safer sex</title>
                <p>Intervention group participants reported the messages were ‘clear’, ‘concise’ and ‘informative’. Participants reported impact on their general knowledge of practising safer sex including new ways to protect themselves, how STIs are contracted, the risks and consequences of unprotected sex and the need to go for regular testing. Some participants appreciated intervention messages as a ‘proper’ source of information with links to trustworthy internet sites that clarified which information from other less reliable sources was correct. A few participants in the open feedback reported messages only said things they already knew.</p>
                <p>Many intervention participants, but also some control group participants, reported increased awareness of the importance of safer sex behaviours. Control group participants were ‘indirectly’ reminded of safer sex importance, because the regular texts reminded them their previous STI and/or because trial participation raised their awareness and motivation. This greater awareness reportedly influenced some intervention and control group participants in being more ‘careful’ in their choice of sexual partners and/or having less casual sex.</p>

                <p>Intervention group participants reported an increased confidence and agency in asserting their needs, for example, greater agency in only having sex when they wanted to. Some participants reported benefits in their sexual well-being such as, ‘feeling positive’ about their sex lives, respecting their body more or greater sexual pleasure through feeling more in control of their sex lives.</p>
                <p>In both the intervention and control group, sexual health was reported to be a ‘difficult’ and a ‘taboo’ subject to talk about. Sharing intervention text messages with partners, friends, housemates and siblings was a catalyst for facilitating open and honest dialogues about sexual health and helped many participants feel less embarrassed raising the topic. Showing partners messages was also used to reinforce requests to use condoms. One person reported the intervention gave them the confidence to start a new relationship after their STI.</p>

                <title>Changes in condom use</title>
                <p>Many intervention, but also some control group respondents reported having been ‘more cautious’ after receiving messages and that texts were good reminders to use condoms. Several participants explicitly reported increased condom use especially with casual or new partners. Intervention group participants attributed this to increases in their confidence and knowledge of how to stay protected from STIs as well as greater confidence in being able to bring up the topic of condom use. Practical tips, including to prevent condoms to break or slip off, had been particularly helpful. One participant, however, said it would be helpful to have more advice on what to do if a partner refuses to use a condom. Those who used condoms did not necessarily use them on every occasion. Reportedly, the messages also led some to encourage their peers to use protection.</p>

                <title>Effects on partner notification</title>
                <p>Participants in the intervention group commonly reported that the text messages enabled them to speak more confidently (calmly and sooner) to their partners about their infection, impacting on how they told partners. Intervention content that chlamydia was common and easy to treat helped facilitate conversations with partners about infection. This content also reduced concerns about getting chlamydia. There were reports that the messages motivated some participants to tell partners. Some stated that the text message examples they received arrived after they had notified partners, and regretted that they had not received them earlier. Some reported only learning from the messages that the clinic could have informed their partner. Two comments referred to unknown partner contact details.</p>

                <p>Participants from both groups reported they sought further STI testing as a result of being in the study. Messages made some participants feel it was ‘Ok to get tested<italic toggle="yes">’</italic> and directly or indirectly reminded intervention and control group participants to test or test more frequently than they normally would have. Participants reported going for testing <italic toggle="yes">after</italic> having sex with a new partner (none mentioned testing <italic toggle="yes">before</italic> first sex).</p>
                <p>A few intervention participants reported frequent STI testing rather than condom use as a way of managing STI risk and to ‘keep track of partners’.</p>
                <p>For some participants, the STI home testing kit was perceived as a central positive aspect of the study, and knowing that another ‘screening’ test would be done made one control group participant ‘more inclined to use condoms’.</p>

                <title>Reduction of isolation and stigma</title>
                <p>Many intervention participants said that taking part in the study reassured them and reduced their feeling of being ‘the only one’, a common feeling after being diagnosed with an STI. Participants frequently commented on the reduction of ‘stigma’, ‘shame’ and feeling ‘less embarrassed’ about having had an STI which was perceived to be reassuring and to have benefits for emotional and mental well-being. In addition, learning that STIs could be easily treated reportedly reassured participants. Some control group participants also noted feeling ‘less alone’ as they ‘belonged to a group of people that have had chlamydia or gonorrhoea’, and one reported that being in the study reduced their embarrassment about having an STI. Another control group participant, however, emphasised that the study made her ‘feel less alone’, but not ‘feel less ashamed’ and she would have liked to be in the group that received texts with support and information.</p>

                <p>Some participants from both groups reported that changes in their behaviour were a consequence of having an STI rather than receiving intervention messages. Additionally, in open feedback many in the control group commented that participating in the study enabled them to make a commitment to changing their behaviour, and a few said that it prompted them to seek help, for example, about abusive relationships. As mentioned in the relevant sections above, the control group texts simply about trial participation had reminded many to adopt precautions such as using condoms, STI testing and asking partners about their last test for STIs.</p>
                <p>A few participants mentioned that they joined safetxt when they had been at a ‘turning point’, and would have changed their behaviour anyway, but appreciated the safetxt support during this time of change. One control group participant, who had reportedly meanwhile changed due to the STI and becoming more mature, thought that safetxt support if targeted at younger people could help them avoid having to go through the same ‘quite big stressful event’ of having an STI.</p>

                <p>Recipients felt the intervention was especially helpful for younger people such as late secondary school/first year post school (<xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 3</xref>). Many interview participants and free-text comments reported that not enough was taught in schools and the texts were much more useful than what they were taught at school. Participants mentioned additional topics that would be helpful to include, such as peer pressure to have sex, further content on dealing with people who do not want to use protection, and pleasurable aspects of condom use; a few women who have sex with men and women requested more information on safer sex between women and two men who have sex with men (MSM) wanted the intervention to cover ‘chem sex’ (stimulant enhanced and prolonged ‘no-strings’ sexual sessions between MSM connecting through apps<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>

                <p>A few participants suggested further personalisation of safetxt messages and an option to choose from a wider range of topics from the outset (in addition to the ‘text 2 to hear more’ option). Some requested better mental health support to explore why people have unprotected sex. Suggestions from participants for changes in the timing and frequency of messages often focused on having some form of control of message frequency, with some wanting less messages (especially at the beginning) and others more (especially towards the end).</p>
                <p>Although many participants said that certain intervention message content would ‘stick’ with them, some would have liked to continue receiving texts, as they served as reminders.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>According to recipients, the safetxt intervention increased awareness of the importance of avoiding STIs and related knowledge about ways to prevent them. Participants reported improved confidence, agency, sexual well-being and communication about sexual health with partners, friends and family members. They attributed to these improvements, increases in condom use, STI testing, more confident partner notification and (for a few) disclosure of diagnoses. There was a reduced sense of isolation, stigma, shame and embarrassment about having an STI which reportedly reassured some participants and improved their emotional well-being.</p>
              <p>Participants from both the intervention and control group reported that having an STI influenced their safer sex behaviours. Control group participants reported that taking part in the study had influenced their commitment to safer sex behaviours. The control group text message about trial participation reminded many about the importance of safer sex and acted as a trigger for STI testing and condom use.</p>
              <p>Our qualitative analyses of interviews and open feedback are mainly consistent with the trial results. However, recipients’ reports suggest larger differences in behaviour than were demonstrated in the trials results. Possible reasons include social desirability bias, an incorrect attribution of changes in behaviour to the intervention rather than the experience of STI and a strong Hawthorne effect<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, including the trial participation messages sent to the control group reportedly acting as a prompt for safer sex behaviours.</p>
              <p>Our findings suggest that young people felt positive impacts of the safetxt intervention on their sexual and reproductive well-being. These benefits include increase in confidence, agency, communication and precautionary behaviours.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The perceived value of safetxt from recipients’ accounts accords with the trial results showing higher condom use at 12 months. The ‘spill-over’ effect resulting from participants reportedly encouraging their peers to use condoms, was not quantitatively assessed during the trial. Recipients accounts that the main perceived benefit of the intervention was in ‘how’ to tell partners rather than ‘whether’ to tell them about their STI accords with the only slightly higher levels of partner notification in the intervention group. The results are not in line with the public health impact of safetxt as the trial results found STIs were not reduced, with slightly more infections in the intervention group. The trial results suggested (although not statistically significant) that there were slightly more participants with two or more partners and a new partner in the intervention group compared with the control group during the course of the trial (altering partnerships was not an intervention aim). The findings from this study involving interviews and feedback obtained after the 12-month intervention of the safetxt trial were in keeping with the findings from telephone interviews conducted in 2013 during the intervention development 2–3 weeks after receiving the first messages, but included longer-term impacts.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>A strength of the interviews and the open feedback analysis was that it was conducted by two researchers not previously involved in the intervention development or trial.</p>
              <p>We analysed all of the open feedback comments left by over 3500 trial participants (56% of participants who enrolled into the trial and 72% of those who completed the 12-month questionnaire). The experience of those not leaving a free-text comment may be different from those who did. However, the characteristics of respondents were similar to the characteristics of trial participants including those from diverse sociodemographic and ethnic groups. It is not possible to blind participants receiving a behavioural intervention, which could introduce bias when obtaining feedback. All open feedback comments were brief, optional and completed at the end of their involvement in the trial, so it was not possible to explore participant views in depth or follow-up on feedback. During interviews, however, (and despite having to stop the interview study slightly earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic), we were able to gain greater insight into themes that had been generated during analysis of open feedback comments.</p>
              <p>Our qualitative analyses provide little direct evidence to explain the unanticipated quantitative trial findings, but raise some plausible explanations. Both qualitative analyses and quantitative analyses of intermediate and secondary trial outcomes showed increased correct condom use self-efficacy and increased condom use. This effect did not seem big enough to translate into reduced reinfection rates in the intervention group, given that those who reported increasingly using condoms did not necessarily use them on every occasion. In addition, a few intervention participants seemed to prefer a secondary prevention approach with frequent STI testing over a primary prevention approach with consistent condom use.</p>
              <p>In both intervention and control groups, there were large reductions between baseline and follow-up in the number of partners in the preceding year, as would be expected if high-risk people were reverting to the norm. However, there was a marginally smaller reduction in the intervention group. Previous trials of group interventions targeting those at high risk for STI, have had unanticipated effects in normalising risk behaviours and increasing STI.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
              <p>The ’shock’ of having had an STI and receiving control group messages reminding them of their STI might have deterred control group participants for a longer period from engaging in new relationships than intervention group participants. Some intervention recipients reported feeling less ashamed about their STI, generally more confident in discussing sexual health and/or reassured that their infection could be easily treated. Lower stigma about having an STI carried benefits in emotional well-being and reportedly gave a few the confidence to start a new relationship following their STI. While this was a positive outcome from recipient’s perspectives, starting a new relationship confers some additional STI risk. Whether that risk is worth taking depends on what people are getting out of new relationships. Our analysis suggest intervention recipients were better equipped to get the sex they want (and to avoid the sex they do not want). The trial suggests that sex was no less a risk for STIs, but it may have had more value to them.</p>
              <p>Our qualitative analysis also suggested that testing <italic toggle="yes">after</italic> sex with new partners was increased, but not <italic toggle="yes">before</italic> first sex. The safetxt trial indicator assessed STI testing ‘prior’ to first sex with new partners (showing no difference between groups), whereas the few previous mHealth trials we identified in a systematic review that showed an effect on STI/HIV-testing, only enquired about whether participants had an STI test within a specified time period.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Secondary analysis of the safetxt trial data looking at overall testing data in clinics (rather than self-reported tests ‘prior’ to first sex) is consistent with this with slightly higher clinic testing for STI in the intervention groups (1549/3123, 50%) vs the control group (1477/3125, 47%).</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>This research has described the perceived impacts of receiving the intervention and control group messages on participants. A randomised controlled trial was needed to identify slightly higher STI diagnoses in the intervention group. The qualitative findings and trial results both show that the components of the safetxt intervention promoting condom use were effective. Since this is a unique finding not seen in any previous similar mHealth interventions,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> service providers could consider delivering this content. Further research could consider recipients recommendations for future interventions and explore how to achieve and measure positive impacts of reduced stigma about having an STI and increase sexual well-being as well as reduce subsequent STI.</p>
