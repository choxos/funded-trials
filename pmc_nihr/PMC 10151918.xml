                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The prevalence of dementia is almost five times higher in people with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population. However, evidence-based treatments for this population are lacking, as most randomised controlled trials for dementia interventions have not included people with intellectual disabilities. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) has a robust evidence base in the general dementia population, consistently showing benefits to cognition, quality of life and being cost-effective. We are conducting a mixed-methods feasibility trial of group CST for people with intellectual disabilities and dementia, to determine if a future definitive randomised controlled trial is feasible.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Fifty individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia will be randomised to either the intervention arm (14 sessions of group CST plus treatment as usual) or the control arm (treatment as usual). Randomisation will occur after informed consent has been obtained and baseline assessments completed. Each arm will have 25 participants, with the intervention arm divided into five or more CST groups with three to five participants in each. The outcomes will be feasibility of recruitment, acceptability and adherence of the intervention, suitability of study outcome measures and feasibility of collecting resource use data. Quantitative and qualitative approaches, including semistructured interviews with group participants, carers and group facilitators, will be employed to assess these outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The prevalence of dementia is almost five times higher in people with intellectual disabilities than the general population,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and people with Down Syndrome have over 90% risk of developing dementia in their later years.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) has a robust, global evidence base in terms of benefits for people with dementia in cognitive function, as well as quality of life and mood.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> group CST is the only non-pharmacological post-diagnostic intervention specifically recommended to support cognition, independence and well-being in individuals with dementia. CST has been shown to be cost-effective<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and has comparable cognitive benefits to anti-dementia medication<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> in the general dementia population. CST is delivered in a group, typically as two 45-min sessions a week, for 7 weeks.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The intervention involves activities such as word association, number and word games and discussion of current affairs. It uses a range of methods to stimulate cognition including executive functioning tasks, reminiscence as an aid to orientation and implicit learning through focusing on opinions rather than facts.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The proposed mechanism of action of CST is through the activation of neuronal networks associated with cognition such as memory and language, and the social interaction within groups supporting group learning and well-being.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Currently, there is limited published research on CST in people with intellectual disabilities. A pilot study investigating the effectiveness of group CST in 25 participants with Down Syndrome without dementia found improvement in cognitive functioning at 3 months in the treatment group in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), but no change to adaptive functioning and quality of life.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The study demonstrated that CST can be adapted for people with intellectual disabilities, indicating that it would be valuable to explore this further in a population with comorbid intellectual disability and dementia. We previously conducted a feasibility study on individual CST (iCST) in people with intellectual disabilities and dementia,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> delivered by a family member or paid caregiver. The study found that iCST was feasible and acceptable in this population, leading to improvements in the individual’s quality of life (as reported by carers). However, a key limitation of this study was poor intervention adherence. Moreover, the evidence base in the general population is stronger for group as opposed to iCST,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and therefore group CST delivered by professionals working with people with intellectual disabilities could be considered a more optimal mode of delivering CST.</p>
              <p>The lack of evidence-based treatments for dementia in the intellectual disability population is particularly concerning given dementia’s high incidence, prevalence, early onset and mortality in this group.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> In most clinical services, only anti-dementia medication is currently offered as a potential treatment. However, the evidence for its effectiveness in the intellectual disability population is scarce and people with intellectual disabilities may be more prone to side effects.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Given the limited access to CST and other psychosocial interventions for dementia in people with intellectual disabilities, it is paramount that this health inequity is prioritised by exploring how CST might benefit people with intellectual disabilities and comorbid dementia.</p>
              <p>This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of group CST as a treatment for people with intellectual disabilities and dementia. The objective is to determine whether a future, larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) of group CST is feasible by assessing the feasibility of recruitment in this study, the suitability of study outcome measures, the acceptability and adherence of CST and the collection of resource use data.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>This will be a single-blind, feasibility RCT of group CST plus TAU versus TAU only, for people with intellectual disabilities and dementia. There will be assessments at baseline (prior to randomisation) and 8–9 weeks later at the end of the intervention. A process evaluation will be conducted to examine the acceptability, adherence and fidelity of the intervention and study methods and as part of this, interviews will be held with group participants, group facilitators and carers.</p>

                <title>Study timeline</title>
                <p>The study duration is 30 months and began on 1 October 2021. Recruitment started on 22 March 2022 and will continue until July 2023. Follow-up assessments, data cleaning and analysis will take place between July 2023 and January 2024.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>This is a feasibility study with no formal power calculation. Instead, a sufficient number of participants need to be recruited in order to determine the attrition and recruitment rates and how these are related to the feasibility of a full-scale RCT. By setting our target sample size at 50, we will achieve adequate precision around our expected retention rate of 75% (95% CI 62% to 86%) to determine the feasibility going forward. Based on our previous study,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> it is anticipated that screening approximately 70 people will be required to reach the sample size. There are no available data on the use of group CST to treat dementia in people with intellectual disabilities. This sample should also provide adequate precision using a CI approach which considers the likelihood of a future definitive study finding a relevant effect size.</p>

                <title>Recruitment of participants</title>
                <p>Participants will be recruited from community intellectual (or learning) disability teams and memory services from participating National Health Service Trusts in England, and General Practice surgeries in the participating areas. Professionals at those services will be asked to screen caseloads for possible participants and will discuss the study with potential participants and their carers. If they are interested in taking part, they will be provided with an information sheet and their details will be passed on to the research team. Posters will be displayed at the above services, local charities and social care organisations in the participating areas allowing potential participants to contact the research team directly. A researcher will then make contact with the potential participant and their carers to arrange a meeting to discuss the study and assess the capacity to consent. If the individual agrees to take part, written consent will be obtained from them. If they lack capacity, a relative or a friend will be approached and provided with information about the study and asked to sign a declaration form. If the individual does not have a family member or friend who can act as a consultee, a nominated consultee (eg, a clinician not involved in the study) will be approached and asked to sign a declaration form. We will ask carers who will be completing proxy/informant measures to also provide consent to taking part in the study.</p>

                <title>Randomisation procedures and blinding</title>
                <p>Randomisation will be undertaken by the coordinating trials unit (North Wales Organisation for Randomised Trials in Health; NWORTH) using a dynamic adaptive randomisation algorithm via a secure online interface. A researcher will enter the necessary details into the web-based randomisation system which will randomly allocate participants to the intervention or control arm after baseline assessments. Randomisation will be stratified by site/centre on a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants will be informed of group allocation by an unblinded researcher. Although participants cannot be blinded to their allocated group, researchers collecting follow-up data will be blinded to group allocation and participants and carers will be reminded before the follow-up assessments not to divulge this information. At the end of the study, researcher blindness will be assessed by asking them to guess group allocation.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The CST intervention will comprise 14 face-to-face group sessions delivered over 7 weeks, in groups of three to five participants, with two facilitators. Sessions will follow the CST treatment manual<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> with a supplement outlining adaptations for clients with intellectual disabilities. Further details of the CST intervention and manual can be found in other publications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The supplement to the manual has been created as part of this study through focus groups and interviews with 14 people (5 occupational therapists, 5 psychologists, 1 speech and language therapist, 1 nurse, 1 psychiatrist and 1 person with intellectual disability) along with feedback from carers from the iCST study for people with intellectual disabilities.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In addition, we have incorporated activities and suggestions from a co-produced manual developed by clinicians and carers of people with dementia and intellectual disabilities from the Wirral Community Learning Disability team.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Example adaptations include removing pricing and adding up food items and instead focusing more on the multisensory aspects of the food items used; using visual cues and replacing words with pictures where possible.</p>
                <p>Facilitators will be clinicians from community intellectual disability services from any profession. They will attend the standard 1-day CST training course and will be provided with the standard CST manual<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and supplement. They will additionally receive training from the research team on the supplement, which will involve discussion on how to adapt sessions for people with intellectual disabilities. The intervention group will continue to have access to TAU (see below).</p>

                <p>Participants in both arms of the trial will have access to their usual care for the duration of the trial, hence will continue to have access to support and care from their community intellectual disability service, including support from psychiatrists, nurses and psychologists and will continue to access any day time activities such as day centres. Participants will continue with ‘medication as usual’, including cognitive enhancing medication (eg, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). These will be recorded carefully at baseline and followed up in the case report form.</p>

                <p>Although determining differences in clinical outcomes between the arms is not the primary purpose of this trial, comparisons will be undertaken to investigate the feasibility of studying these outcomes and to calculate estimates for the likely effect sizes and 95% CIs. We will obtain estimates of the treatment effects. Differences between the two comparison groups will be presented as unadjusted mean differences for continuous outcomes, and an OR for binary outcomes, with their associated 95% CIs. Despite the individual randomisation, this is a group-based treatment and therefore consideration will also be made in regard to the estimation of the potential intra-cluster correlation (ICC) coefficient. The estimation of the likely ICC together with external information from the literature will guide the sample size calculation for a future trial. No methods of imputation will be used for missing data due to the feasibility nature of the study but levels of missingness will be considered as part of the feasibility criteria.</p>
