                  <p>We sought to answer three questions: (i) Can combination treatment be used safely and effectively by people with vitiligo?; (ii) Should combination treatment be made available as routine clinical care?; and (iii) Can combination treatment be integrated within current healthcare provision?</p>

                  <p>Participants found individual treatments easy to use, but the combination treatment was complicated and required nurse support. Both participants and site investigators felt that combination treatment should be made available, although commissioners were less certain. There was support for the development of services offering combination treatment, although this might not be prioritized above treatment for other conditions. A ‘mixed economy’ model was suggested, involving patients purchasing their own devices, although concerns regarding the safe use of treatments mean that training, monitoring and ongoing support are essential. The need for medical physics support may mean that a regional service is more practical.</p>

                <p>The HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial showed that hand‐held home‐based narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy (NB‐UVB) in combination with potent topical corticosteroid (TCS) gives a better treatment response than potent TCS alone in people with active, limited vitiligo. Trial participants and healthcare professionals agreed that combination treatment with home‐based, hand‐held NB‐UVB and potent TCS should be made available to people with active, limited vitiligo. Some participants found it complicated to follow a regimen of combination treatment with TCS and hand‐held NB‐UVB. It was not always possible to predict which people were more likely to have difficulties. Concerns regarding the safe use of TCS and NB‐UVB mean that careful selection of suitable recipients for combination treatment, followed by adequate training, monitoring and ongoing support, are essential. Medical physics services need to be closely involved in the provision of home‐based hand‐held NB‐UVB treatment, to ensure that devices are properly checked and maintained. This may mean that regional, rather than local, provision is more practical <boxed-text position="anchor" content-type="graphic"><graphic xlink:href="CED-47-1480-g001.jpg" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1"/></boxed-text>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Vitiligo causes depigmented patches of skin and can have a considerable impact on quality of life. Two of the most commonly used vitiligo treatments are topical corticosteroid (TCS) and narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy (NB‐UVB).<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In the UK, people have mixed experiences of obtaining treatments for vitiligo, including TCS.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> NB‐UVB treatment is reserved for people with extensive vitiligo, and is administered using whole‐body cabinets in hospital settings. Provision of home‐based, handheld NB‐UVB devices is rare outside a small number of specialist centres.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>The HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> was a three‐arm, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving children (age ≥5 years) and adults with vitiligo limited to approximately 10% or less of the body and at least one active patch of vitiligo. Recruitment took place in 16 UK hospitals. Participants were randomized to receive potent TCS plus dummy NB‐UVB, handheld NB‐UVB plus dummy TCS, or a combination of potent TCS plus NB‐UVB. TCS (or dummy) was applied once daily on alternate weeks. NB‐UVB (or dummy) was used on alternate days, with dose adjustment if erythema occurred. Treatments were used for 9 months, with 3‐monthly clinic assessments, followed by 12 months of post‐treatment follow‐up to assess duration of treatment response.</p>
              <p>The trial demonstrated that for people with active, limited vitiligo, combination treatment with potent TCS and home‐based, handheld NB‐UVB offers a better treatment response than potent TCS alone.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> It also demonstrated that combination treatment offers better value for money than NB‐UVB or potent TCS used in isolation in the treatment of active, limited vitiligo.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>However, there are uncertainties in how best to implement this treatment combination in clinical practice. The benefits of this treatment combination (home‐based treatment, which reduces hospital visits; localized treatment, which minimizes exposure of unaffected skin to NB‐UVB) may need to be balanced against safety concerns, the complexities of combining treatment regimens, and the practicalities of testing and providing equipment within existing care pathways.</p>
              <p>Here we report summary findings of a process evaluation nested within the HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Evaluating the opinions of stakeholders [people with vitiligo, parents of children with vitiligo, health service commissioners, healthcare professionals (HCPs)] we addressed three specific questions: (i) Can combination treatment be used safely and effectively by people with vitiligo?; (ii) Should combination treatment be made available as routine clinical care?; and (iii) Can combination treatment be integrated within current healthcare provision?</p>

                <p>To avoid bias, the trial participants were approached to take part in an interview after they had completed the 9‐month treatment phase of the trial, and we included those with both ‘successful’ and ‘unsuccessful’ treatment, as judged by the primary outcome measure (Table <xref rid="ced15193-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Interview questions considered treatment experience, the benefits and difficulties of combination treatment, and views about how combination treatment might be delivered/managed in the future.</p>
                <p>Interviews with service commissioners considered topics such as awareness of vitiligo, local commissioning processes, and mechanisms that would support commissioning of new vitiligo treatments.</p>
                <p>At the close of the study, all site investigators were emailed a link to an online survey (using Survey Monkey™ survey software). Survey questions covered potential challenges of delivering combination treatment and sought recommendations to support its future implementation. All questions included both fixed‐choice and free‐text response options. Site investigators were also invited to take part in an evaluation focus group to consider the implementation of combination therapy for vitiligo.</p>
                <p>All interviews were conducted by telephone or video call while focus groups were face‐to‐face groups. All qualitative data were recorded using digital audio equipment.</p>

In total, 25 site investigators (7 doctors, 16 nurses and 1 other) from the 16 recruiting sites responded to the online survey, and 13 (2 doctors and 11 nurses) participated in the focus group discussions.</p>

                  <title>Using treatments individually</title>
                  <p>Most trial participants thought that the individual treatments were relatively simple and easy to use.</p>
                  <p>Some difficulties with light therapy were identified – such as parts of the body being difficult to reach, or devices breaking down or devices being damaged. The time commitment required for light treatment was a cause for comment, especially when treating multiple patches:
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0001"><list-item><p>Adult participant 3: ‘<italic toggle="yes">…it felt like an awful amount of time, I am pretty busy and to eventually be spending in excess of three quarters of an hour per two days just felt like an inordinate amount of time</italic>.’</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adult participant 4: ‘…<italic toggle="yes">[to start with] I was doing different parts of my body like six or seven [patches] or something … Then [because of the time] I just did three, the three patches they were interested in, so I was just treating them, no more</italic>.’</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                  <p>By contrast, TCS was reported as easy to use, with the only issues being its greasy nature and poor absorption:
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0002"><list-item><p>Adult participant 13: ‘<italic toggle="yes">Yes, that's nothing; you just put it on before you went to sleep and you'd go to bed and I would just maybe be conscious of it for about twenty minutes to let it soak in and that was not a problem, the cream was not really an issue</italic>.’</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                  <p>Interestingly, most of the trial participants did not raise concerns about adverse effects (AEs) of using a potent TCS on alternate weeks for up to 9 months.</p>
                  <p>None of these difficulties made either of the individual treatments unacceptable to participants.</p>

                  <title>Complexity in combining treatments</title>
                  <p>Although easy to manage individually, some site investigators were concerned that the complexity of managing two treatments in combination could be challenging for the people using them. Increasing or decreasing the NB‐UVB dose (as part of the treatment protocol or in response to erythema) seemed to confuse and cause difficulties for certain trial participants. Some site investigators were concerned that some individuals never fully understood the process of incremental dose change.
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0003"><list-item><p>Site investigator focus group: Nurse 1 : <italic toggle="yes">‘I think they struggled with the alternate days, I think they forgot about it, sometimes it didn't fit, they skipped a day if they had work commitments.

</p>
                  <p>Data presented by trial participants suggested that this assessment was accurate for some:
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0004"><list-item><p>Parent of child participant 5: ‘<italic toggle="yes">Yeah I found it confusing for the first few weeks, it was like one week on one week off [for TCS], and every other day for the light and stuff</italic>.’</p></list-item></list>

                  <title>The importance of support</title>
                  <p>Trial participants considered that the support of research nurses was essential in managing the treatment protocol (e.g. responding to erythema and assessing whether treatment was making a difference). They also recognized the value of a treatment diary to record treatment and AEs:
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0005"><list-item><p>Adult participant 3: ‘<italic toggle="yes">Yes, without that [treatment diary] it would be nowhere, without the form that you fill in with boxes I mean and writing down the time you would be absolutely nowhere, there's no chance in a million that you would actually keep to anything like the protocol</italic>.’</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                  <p>Site investigators expressed concern about potential safety implications of the treatment:
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0006"><list-item><p>Site investigator focus group: Nurse 7: ‘…<italic toggle="yes">people do all sorts of things, they do</italic>…'</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nurse 10: ‘…<italic toggle="yes">you give them …something that it is relatively dangerous, UV light.

</p>
                  <p>Some trial participants acknowledged that they had misused accidentally (or willingly) the light treatment device:
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0007"><list-item><p>Adult participant 3: ‘<italic toggle="yes">I was completely knackered …at the end of the day, had done the light treatment.

                  <title>It should be made available</title>
                  <p>Although identified as potentially complex there was consensus that this type of combination treatment should be more widely available to people with vitiligo; 75% of site investigators (in the survey) agreed or strongly agreed with this. In the discussion, they reiterated this position, emphasizing that this is a clinical population with few treatment options. 
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0008"><list-item><p>Site investigator focus group: Nurse 9: ‘<italic toggle="yes">We have always said that it [combination treatment] is the best of a bad bunch of treatments, and it probably still is. There is no fantastic treatment out there for vitiligo, there doesn't seem to be, and the trial doesn't show that it's fantastic.

</p>
                  <p>Commissioners reinforced that people with vitiligo have few treatment options available to them and that treatment pathways for vitiligo are often lacking.</p>
                  <p>Trial participants described a desire for access to treatment; in particular, parents of child participants were often quite desperate for any treatment that might offer hope of remission. 
<list list-type="simple" id="ced15193-list-0009"><list-item><p>Parent of child participant 9: ‘…<italic toggle="yes">we've been looking for a long time to find something like that because we've been at the NHS [National Health Service], and we were at a private doctor and nobody could not offer us anything except like some ointment, like cream and it was not really help …half of me was hoping that yes, something would work and it would help her, but if it didn't then we wasn't really going to lose anything</italic>.’</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                  <p>These reflect the most common reasons motivating participation in the HI‐Light Trial. Some participants hoped that it would bring them access to new treatments for themselves or their children, while some subsequently hoped for complete remission and others hoped that their disease would stop spreading. For a minority of participants there was a sense of ‘nothing to lose’:

                  <p>However, neither the online survey respondents nor participants in the site investigator focus group indicated that combination treatment would be appropriate for all people.</p>
                  <p>Site investigators described how personal circumstances, such as mental health issues, other health problems or significant caring responsibilities (e.g. multiple children), might affect an individual's ability to follow a complex treatment regimen. They also said that people with unrealistic expectations of treatment response (e.g. rapid and dramatic improvements) might be less suitable candidates for combination treatment, as they might ignore the treatment regimen to accelerate improvements:

                  <p>Similarly, trial participants expressed the opinion that where improvement did not match expectations, an individual might prematurely cease treatment. Some of those trial participants allocated the dummy NB‐UVB phototherapy described their frustrations:

                  <p>Site investigators indicated that combination treatment for vitiligo might be delivered within broader dermatology phototherapy provision, and some indicated that they were already reusing devices in this type of setting for the treatment of vitiligo.

                  <p>However, commissioners considered it unlikely that dedicated services for vitiligo of this kind would be commissioned.

Regarding this, site investigators stressed the importance of careful monitoring to ensure safe use of treatments, with an early follow‐up important to establish appropriate use and clinical benefit:

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial has demonstrated that 62% of participants receiving combination treatment gained some degree of benefit, with 27% achieving treatment success and 35% achieving partial treatment success.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Site investigators were encouraged and felt that the results supported further implementation; however, comments from some commissioners suggest that the results may be insufficient to support new treatment pathways, with some commissioners considering vitiligo to be a cosmetic problem, even though research has shown this not to be the case.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Despite these differences of opinion, interviews with trial participants and site investigators support the potential for home‐based, handheld, NB‐UVB phototherapy, as has been demonstrated previously,<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and demonstrate the importance of offering new treatment options for people with vitiligo.</p>
              <p>However, our evaluation also identified concerns about inappropriate use of NB‐UVB and about potentially harmful AEs. Previous studies of home‐based phototherapy have indicated that recipients need to be carefully selected<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and willing to follow treatment guidelines.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> ‘Reliable’ people are those who understand the treatment risk and can follow instructions,<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> although unconscious bias could lead to potentially suitable recipients being denied treatment; for instance, having other health issues, not understanding the treatment or being unwilling to be clinically monitored might suggest candidates who are ‘unsuitable’ for home‐based phototherapy.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Our evaluation reinforces that candidate selection is complex, and that home‐based phototherapy will not be suitable for all.</p>
              <p>Our evaluation also highlights that predicting behaviour is difficult, and that a programme of training, monitoring and ongoing support is essential in the delivery of combination treatment for vitiligo. The importance of supervision<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and of regular follow‐up appointments to monitor treatment response<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> have been recommended previously. Weekly phone contact and monthly outpatient visits have been proposed in a new NHS home‐based phototherapy service.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Early and regular follow‐up contact may ensure appropriate use of TCS and NB‐UVB, limit side‐effects and help identify those struggling to manage the treatment regimen. Regular contact may also help HCPs to feel confident about the delivery of a home‐based treatment programme. A shared decision‐making tool has recently been developed,<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> enabling people with vitiligo and HCPs to consider different treatment options, and to make joint decisions about which treatments might be most appropriate for a particular person, including whether they are likely to be able to use home‐based NB‐UVB safely and effectively.</p>
              <p>Concerns around the safety of home‐based phototherapy support the involvement of medical physics departments in setting up and maintaining NB‐UVB devices. This is supported by our findings that the output of the NB‐UVB devices is quite variable, so they need to be checked thoroughly before use.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> This potentially limits the delivery of home‐based phototherapy and suggests that a regional, rather than local, service might be required (with medical physics services provided via a hub‐and‐spoke model).<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> This is in keeping with the comments from both site investigators and commissioners, who identified the economic constraints in creating novel, dedicated services for people with vitiligo. The NB‐UVB devices used in the HI‐Light Trial were purchased by the recruiting hospitals and remained their property on completion of the trial. However, despite the devices being available after the trial, very few sites had immediate plans to use the devices within pre‐existing phototherapy services. This was partly due to the costs and complexities of ensuring adequate medical physics oversight of the NB‐UVB devices and of providing adequate nursing input to ensure their safe use.</p>
              <p>Internationally, the potential of handheld NB‐UVB devices for vitiligo treatment has been recognized,<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and individual purchase or rental of phototherapy devices is common.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> There is some suggestion that private purchase and long‐term self‐management are linked with a greater incidence of AEs,<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> reinforcing the importance of training and monitoring even where phototherapy devices are paid for personally. A Dutch service model, requiring individuals to demonstrate safe and appropriate use of a NB‐UVB device before it can be rented,<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> seems a pragmatic solution to this. It is difficult to say whether or not a ‘mixed economy’ model for providing NB‐UVB devices would the best option within the NHS; the legal and logistical aspects of leasing devices may prove more complicated than providing the devices and training within pre‐existing phototherapy service frameworks.</p>
              <p>In the process of running the HI‐Light Trial, we developed various resources that can be used to support delivery of a home‐based phototherapy service using handheld devices, including a training video, a dosing schedule and treatment diary/handbook, and instructions on how to measure minimal erythema dose. These are accessible via our website.<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>The strengths of the study were that it was a comprehensive process evaluation, drawing upon the experiences of participants who received TCS plus NB‐UVB combination treatment for vitiligo, those who delivered the treatment and those who might commission it in the future. The findings complement the clinical and economic assessments reported elsewhere,<xref rid="ced15193-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ced15193-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and provide an important context to inform future service development and delivery. Regarding limitations, we acknowledge that centres and participants were to some extent self‐selecting and that qualitative data analysis is in part an interpretative (rather than objective) process. Although we tried to avoid bias by including trial participants with both ‘successful’ and ‘unsuccessful’ treatment outcomes, all had continued treatment for the full 9‐month period and so their views may not have been fully representative. Further research with other patients, HCPs or a larger sample of commissioners may have yielded different findings.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Although the combination treatment of TCS plus NB‐UVB is relatively complex to manage and will not be suitable for all patients, we found that, in the absence of other treatment options, people with vitiligo and HCPs were positive about its potential. Given the economic challenges of commissioning new services, a ‘mixed economy’ model of provision (where people with vitiligo purchase or hire devices) may be worth considering, although this would need to be explored in more detail, by directly asking people with vitiligo about their likely willingness to pay in such a model. Regardless of how the NB‐UVB devices might be provided, concerns regarding the safe use of TCS and NB‐UVB mean that training, monitoring and ongoing support to those using combination treatment are essential. The need for medical physics support may mean that a regional service is more practical than a local one.<boxed-text position="anchor" content-type="box" id="ced15122-blkfxd-0002"><sec id="ced15122-sec-0021"><title>What's already known about this topic?</title><p><list list-type="bullet" id="ced15193-list-0017"><list-item><p>In the UK, people with vitiligo have mixed experiences of accessing treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>NB‐UVB is used quite widely, but usually for extensive vitiligo, using whole‐body cabins in a hospital setting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The HI‐Light Vitiligo Trial showed that handheld home‐based NB‐UVB in combination with potent TCS resulted in better treatment responses than potent TCS alone in people with active, limited vitiligo.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="ced15193-sec-0027"><title>What does this study add?</title><p><list list-type="bullet" id="ced15193-list-0018"><list-item><p>Both trial participants and HCPs agreed that combination treatment with home‐based, handheld NB‐UVB and potent TCS should be made available to people with active, limited vitiligo.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Some participants found it complicated to follow a regimen of combination treatment with TCS and handheld NB‐UVB, and it was not always possible to predict which people were more likely to have difficulties.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A perceived lack of demand for treatment, or views that vitiligo is mainly a cosmetic problem, may be potential barriers to the commissioning of new services providing home‐based handheld NB‐UVB for vitiligo.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Concerns about the safe use of TCS and NB‐UVB mean that adequate training, monitoring and ongoing support are essential</p></list-item><list-item><p>Medical physics services need to be closely involved in the provision of home‐based handheld NB‐UVB treatment, to ensure that devices are properly checked and maintained, which may mean that regional, rather than local, provision is more practical</p></list-item></list></p></sec></boxed-text>
