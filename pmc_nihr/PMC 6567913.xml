                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">THRIVE is a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) that aims to evaluate whether antenatal and early postnatal interventions, Enhanced Triple B for Baby (ETPB) plus care as usual (CAU) or Mellow Bumps (MB) plus CAU (versus CAU alone), can: 1) improve the mental health and well-being of pregnant women with complex health and social care needs; 2) improve mother-infant bonding and interaction; 3) reduce child maltreatment; and 4) improve child language acquisition. This paper focuses on THRIVE’s realist process evaluation, which is carefully monitoring what is happening in the RCT.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Realistic evaluation provides the theoretical rationale for the process evaluation. We question: 1) how faithfully are MB and ETPB implemented? 2) What are the mechanisms by which they work, if they do, and who do they work for and how? 3) What contextual factors are necessary for the programmes to function, or might prevent them functioning?</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The mixed-methods design includes quantitative measures, which are pre- and post-training/intervention questionnaires for facilitators and mothers-to-be, and post-session evaluation forms. Qualitative data collection methods include participant observation of facilitator training and the delivery of a series of antenatal sessions in selected intervention groups (<italic>n =</italic> 3 for ETPB and <italic>n =</italic> 3 for MB), semi-structured interviews with facilitators, pregnant women, partners, and referring facilitators, and telephone interviews examining the content of the postnatal components of ETPB and MB.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The findings of this process evaluation will help researchers and decision makers interpret the outcomes of THRIVE. It will provide a greater understanding of: how the interventions work (if they do); the extent and quality of their implementation; contextual factors facilitating and constraining intervention functioning; variations in response within and between subgroups of vulnerable parents; and benefits or unintended consequences of either intervention. Few studies to date have published detailed research protocols illustrating how realist process evaluation is designed and conducted as an integral part of a randomised controlled trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">This paper describes the planned process evaluation component of a Trial of Healthy Relationship Initiatives for the Very Early years (THRIVE), a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) of two parenting interventions for vulnerable pregnant women. THRIVE is investigating whether receiving antenatal and early postnatal parenting interventions, in addition to care as usual (CAU), can improve maternal mental health, mother-infant relationships, and child language development compared with receiving routine antenatal care alone. The protocol for the trial and research questions for the outcomes evaluation can be found in the study documentation on the funder’s website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The process evaluation will examine how faithfully Mellow Bumps (MB) and Enhanced Triple P for Baby (ETPB) are implemented, the mechanisms by which ETPB and MB work (if they work), who the interventions work for and how, and what contextual factors are necessary for the programmes to function as intended or prevent them functioning. The rigorous approach to evaluation outlined here is important and timely, given that it is current UK policy to invest significant resources in psychosocial parenting interventions in the antenatal and early postnatal period. The publication of protocols for process evaluations has particular utility for researchers who may be aware of recent guidelines for best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] but lack examples of how to design and execute work of this complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Women who are more vulnerable in pregnancy, due to domestic abuse, mental health problems, addictions, or a combination of complex social factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], are more likely to suffer from stress, depression, and/or anxiety, and produce higher levels of stress-related hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Stress and mental health problems during pregnancy may disrupt a mother’s capacity to subsequently interact sensitively with her baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Poor quality interaction between mother and child, and maternal mental health problems, are also strong predictors of child maltreatment. Children who experience adversity (e.g. maltreatment) during the very early years demonstrate reduced language skills compared with their peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Other effects may last well into adulthood, reducing opportunities for educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and have negative impacts on emotional and mental well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is currently a paucity of evidence about whether and how parenting programmes targeting vulnerable families in the very early years are effective (or not) at improving maternal mental health and outcomes for children.</p>
              <p id="Par8">THRIVE is recruiting ‘vulnerable’ pregnant women (as defined by the Special Needs in Pregnancy protocol (SNiPS) of the Glasgow Child Protection Committee) at 20–30 weeks of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Participants will be referred through their antenatal booking clinics and randomly assigned to receive ETPB plus CAU, MB plus CAU, or CAU. The aims of the RCT are to evaluate whether ETPB plus CAU or MB plus CAU can: 1) improve maternal mental health and well-being; 2) improve mother-infant bonding and interaction; 3) reduce child maltreatment; and 4) improve child language acquisition. Children will also be followed up at 30 months to assess socio-emotional development and educational outcomes. The recent guidance of the Medical Research Council (MRC) highlights the importance of incorporating mixed-methods process evaluations into RCTs for the testing of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The recommendation is that process evaluations include three key elements in their design: 1) data gathering to capture, and describe in detail, what happens during implementation; 2) identifying and investigating the mechanisms through which interventions operate; and 3) explaining the influence of ‘context’ (“which may include anything external to the intervention which impedes or strengthens its effects”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Reports of process evaluations have been criticised for not being explicit about theoretical influences and for lacking sufficient explanation of 1) what counts as context and 2) how intervention mechanisms and contextual elements interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The broad principles of realist evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] provides realist process evaluators with a framework that may make it easier to articulate, and test, the theoretical underpinnings of interventions like MB and ETPB (i.e. key components, intended mechanisms of action, and anticipated benefits) and make more explicit theorising about context-mechanism-outcome relationships (CMO configurations). Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the approach of Pawson and Tilley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] to realistic evaluation which has informed the design of THRIVE’s process evaluation.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The key aims of realist evaluation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><bold>Aim 1: Understanding the theory of programmes and how they work</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> 1.

              <p id="Par9">Although many researchers present them as diametrically opposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], experimental social science is viewed by some as being highly compatible with the methodological principles and epistemological assumptions of critical realism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Recent discussions have highlighted the possibilities of designing ‘realist RCTs’ and suggest ways that realist principles might be integrated across all phases of the MRC framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although there are excellent examples of how realist evaluation might be used for evaluation in different healthcare contexts (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]), there have been very few protocols of realist process evaluations embedded within RCTs published to date.</p>
              <p id="Par10">THRIVE’s realist process evaluation aims to provide a greater understanding of: how the interventions work (if they do); the extent and quality of their implementation; contextual factors facilitating and constraining intervention functioning; variations in response within and between subgroups of vulnerable parents; and will explore benefits and/or unintended consequences of either intervention. In practice, it is a huge challenge, both methodologically and with the resources available, to design and execute a realist process evaluation that allows us to explore and document such complexities. We present a detailed protocol for THRIVE’s realist process evaluation, which explains how and why we designed this study the way we have, which may be of utility to other researchers designing realist process evaluations of RCTs.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par11">THRIVE is a 5-year RCT with a stratified randomised sample that ensures intervention groups will have a mix of identified vulnerabilities (see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for an overview of the main activities of the outcome and process evaluation). The trial and the mixed-methods realist process evaluation is led and managed at the MRC/Chief Scientist Office (CSO) Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, UK, following MRC guidelines. The lead researcher for the realist process evaluation is based at the School of Health and Life Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, UK. There is regular communication between the outcome and process evaluation teams, although we take advisement from a Data Monitoring Committee and a process evaluation advisory group about data management. Ethical approval was granted to conduct this research by the NHS’s West of Scotland Research Ethics Service, reference 13/WS/0163.</p>

                <title>Stage I of process evaluation design: understanding the theory of how ETPB and MB work</title>
                <p id="Par12">An important starting point for THRIVE’s realist process evaluation was to map the theory of change for each of the interventions (see Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for ETPB and MB theory of change models), in other words to model how ETPB and MB are theorized to work and produce beneficial change (in line with Pawson and Tilley’s approach to realistic evaluation, as described under Aim 1 of Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). ETPB and MB were developed by researchers and facilitators with considerable expertise in designing parenting interventions. Both interventions are for women from 20 weeks of pregnancy and aim to reduce maladaptive responses to stress, maltreatment of children, and improve socio-developmental outcomes for children. However, there are fundamental differences in focus and mechanisms between ETPB and MB.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Enhanced Triple P for Baby: theory of change</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3395_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Mellow Bumps: theory of change</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3395_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Levels of support provide by the Positive Parenting Programme. ©Triple P International (reproduced with written permission <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.triplep.net/glo-en/find-out-about-triple-p/">https://www.triplep.net/glo-en/find-out-about-triple-p/</ext-link>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3395_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>

                  <p id="Par13">In the developmental, planning, and organizational stages of THRIVE the team reviewed evidence on Triple P and Mellow Parenting interventions and intervention materials (where available).

                  <title>Enhanced Triple P for Baby (ETPB)</title>
                  <p id="Par14">ETPB is the most recently developed variant of the University of Queensland’s Positive Parenting Program’s (Triple P) five-tiered standardized system of family support (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which will be delivered and evaluated for the first time as part of THRIVE. ETPB, devised by Clinical Psychologists and underpinned by cognitive and behavioural theory, offers enhanced (Level 5) support to parents with ‘additional needs’.</p>
                  <p id="Par15">The Triple P research group has published a wealth of studies and meta-analyses that report on the efficacy and effectiveness of other variants of Triple P (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], see also: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.triplep.net/glo-en/home/">http://www.triplep.net/glo-en/home/</ext-link>). Triple P was appraised by NICE as being particularly effective for the treatment of conduct disorder based on five RCTs that delivered Standard (Level 3) and Self-directed and Enhanced levels of Triple P (Level 5), suggesting that Triple P may have particular benefits for families trying to address severe behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par16">Qualitative studies have largely been absent from evaluations of Triple P to date, which limits understanding of how and why these programmes work, for whom, and in what context, although there are a few very recent exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Qualitative work has begun to make more explicit the behavioural changes that take place following participation in Triple P, for example praising children more often who, in turn, appeared more responsible and better at following instructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Qualitative research has also helped to identify necessary adaptations that are needed when transporting Triple P to a different social and cultural context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par17">Positive trial results have been questioned by researchers who were critical of ‘small sample sizes’ and who have suggested there is a ‘high risk of bias’ due to ‘lack of independence’ of Triple P evaluations, ‘poor reporting’, and ‘conflicts of interest’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, Triple P evaluators argue that critical reviews (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]) overlook the multiple levels, modes, and intensities of Triple P and fail to consider the broad range of possible outcomes generated by different variants of the programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of a wider sample of Triple P programmes found that there were short-term effects on a wide range of child, parent, and family outcomes, including children’s social, emotional, and behavioural outcomes, relationships, parenting satisfaction, and efficacy, as identified in parent observational data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par18">While still to be tested, ETPB aims to improve parents’ maladaptive psychological coping strategies for managing stress (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for theory of change endorsed by Triple P International). Based on our observation of what was presented at facilitator training, and reading materials that were distributed about the programme, we know that parents will be offered four antenatal group sessions, each lasting 2 h, covering four ‘universal’ issues that commonly affect new parents. These include: 1) ‘positive parenting’; 2) ‘responding to your baby’ (education about infant development); 3) ‘survival skills’ (raising awareness of the connection between feelings and behaviour and how these impact on parents’ interactions with their baby); and 4) ‘partner support’ (development of skills to improve partner relationships and manage the stresses of parenting).</p>
                  <p id="Par19">These sessions are theorized to improve psychological coping by offering new knowledge about infant development, new parenting skills (e.g. how to manage sleep, feeding, and soothing the baby), improved self-awareness of feelings and behaviour when interacting with the baby, and skills to improve and sustain the partner relationship. Postnatal support (up to three one-to-one sessions of 1 h and one group session) is introduced from 6 weeks after birth. Parents use this time to practice positive parenting skills and strategies with their baby in a naturalistic setting and facilitators provide them with feedback. Facilitators are trained to use a guided participation model, based on self-regulation theory, which encourages parents to identify their own solutions to problems. Therefore, self-management, self-efficacy, personal agency and problem solving appear to be implicit drivers of change. It is theorized that the outcomes of the ETPB include more positive and sensitive interaction with baby, greater self-confidence and efficacy as parents, fewer postnatal adjustment and mood disorders, greater perceived social support, and less discord in the partner relationship, which all result in a significantly improved mother-infant relationship.</p>
                  <p id="Par20">A recent evaluation of another new Triple P programme, Baby Triple P, reports that mothers with postnatal depression (albeit a very small sample) found the delivery of an early postnatal parenting intervention highly acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The pilot RCT showed more favourable improvements in the intervention group on measures of depression, happiness, and perceptions of parenting a new baby, postpartum bonding, and parenting beliefs, although results were not significant. Another study of staff at a Mother and Baby Unit treating mothers presenting with severe mental illness also suggested that it would be feasible, and likely to be acceptable, to deliver Baby Triple P to women in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. It remains to be seen how a wider ranging sample of vulnerable women respond to a similar parenting intervention and whether or not the enhanced component of Baby Triple P has any additive effects.</p>

                  <title>Mellow Bumps (MB)</title>
                  <p id="Par21">MB, developed in Scotland, UK, is an antenatal intervention developed by Mellow Parenting (a group that is led by a research-active Clinical Psychologist). The social and cultural context of the area in which Mellow Parenting is based, an area of very high deprivation, was certainly influential to the initial development of support for women, although programmes are now delivered in a variety of settings and social contexts (as is the case for Triple P, which has international reach). MB was designed in response to the high levels of stress vulnerable women reported experiencing during and after pregnancy, as identified through early evaluation of Mellow Babies.</p>
                  <p id="Par22">Current evidence on Mellow Parenting programmes includes a mix of peer-reviewed publications and grey literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] (also see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mellowparenting.org/">http://www.mellowparenting.org/</ext-link>). Mellow Babies reportedly improved mother and child well-being and quality of the mother-child interaction, and was associated with an increased uptake of relevant services, including education, mental health, and social services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Mothers who participated in Mellow Babies groups described a positive change in their perception of their children and an increased self-confidence in handling ‘difficult’ child behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Recent findings of a feasibility trial that compared Mellow Bumps, Chill out In Pregnancy (CHIP), and CAU suggest that MB may be effective at lowering maternal anxiety and mothers’ outwardly directed irritability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, there was a need for a definitive and well-powered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] RCT to fully test these promising findings. The feasibility trial has been particularly informative about the procedures and processes needed to support THRIVE’s RCT.</p>
                  <p id="Par23">MB offers six 2 h antenatal group sessions for pregnant women and an optional seventh session for fathers delivered in Week 5. The final group postnatal session is convened 6 weeks after birth. The principal aims of MB are to improve: 1) the reflective functioning and self-care (e.g. poorly managing stress) of pregnant women; and 2) parenting skills. MB is theorized to work by providing nurturance (e.g. improved nurturing and relaxation and support in expressing and dealing with emotions) and guided reflection to improve capacity to reflect on parenting (e.g. by improving maternal representations of early attachment relationships) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Facilitators are trained to foster the nurturing and relaxing ethos of the group by conducting a ‘meet and greet’ session with participants in their homes prior to group attendance, inviting women to join a ‘closed’ and ‘safe’ group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and taking care of participants’ needs while at the group (e.g. welcoming them and offering refreshments on arrival). Facilitators devote time within each session to stress reduction (guided relaxation), which is intended to bring benefits to both mother-to-be and baby. Mothers-to-be are usually given a small gift during the session, for example bubble bath or massage oil to encourage self-care at home. The social aspect of the group (i.e. potentially gaining support from other mothers-to-be and non-judgemental facilitators) was found to be of therapeutic benefit in Mellow Babies groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and may well have similar effects for participants of MB.</p>
                  <p id="Par24">The theorized aims are to improve attachment and the quality of interaction between mother and baby; mothers-to-be are shown educational videos and play interactive games to learn about their baby’s capacity to respond to them whilst in the womb and during the very early postnatal period. Mothers-to-be are encouraged to interact with their bumps by being given torches to shine on their bumps to track movement of the baby and talking or singing to their bumps at home. The anticipated benefits of the intervention are reduced stress, anxiety, and irritability, greater self-acceptance, and better self-care and improved parenting skills and positive intentions, which reduce risks of child maltreatment and increase mother-infant attachment.

                <p id="Par27">We question how faithfully ETPB and MB are implemented in relation to the developer manuals or protocols and will explore the wider contextual factors that may influence programme fidelity. Prior knowledge of, or experience of, delivering different levels or variants of Triple P programmes and/or Mellow Parenting programmes are two possible factors that could affect how faithfully interventions are delivered. Other influences may include the clarity and consistency of training and intervention materials and the amount of work that facilitators feel they need to undertake in order to familiarize themselves with content and deliver the interventions.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>2.</label><p id="Par28"><italic>What are the mechanisms by which</italic> ETPB and MB <italic>work, if they work, who do they work for and how?</italic></p></list-item></list></p>

We will compare the responses of participants and facilitators to the skills-based approach taken in ETPB with the nurturing and therapeutic approach taken by MB. We question the extent to which experiences within particular groups (e.g. in terms of vulnerabilities) result in the firing, or inhibition, of change mechanisms. We will also examine the decision making of referring facilitators about what to deliver, adapt, or leave out, and their sensitivity towards pregnant women.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>3.</label><p id="Par30"><italic>What contextual factors are necessary for the programmes to function, or might prevent them functioning?</italic></p></list-item></list></p>

We will examine the extent to which the professional backgrounds of facilitators, and prior knowledge of ETPB and/or MB, or previous training in these interventions, influence the way interventions are delivered and how they engage with participants. We also aim to locate the accounts of participants of their participation in ETPB or MB within a wider context of their lives and their experiences of parenting and of being parented. We question the extent to which group dynamics might be affected by the particular mix of vulnerabilities (e.g. homogenous or heterogeneous group composition). We aim to explore the nature of participants’ vulnerabilities in detail and question the extent to which ETPB, MB, or individual mechanisms within each are perceived to help.

Few qualitative studies have been published to date on Triple P or Mellow Parenting programmes that offer detailed insights into these critical processes. Ethnography in particular, it is argued, has an ‘untapped’ potential to yield new insights into the processes that influence the functioning of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], although it is still relatively rarely utilised. An ethnographic approach to process evaluation has recently been suggested as being particularly helpful for trials being conducted with vulnerable groups or challenging social contexts and where building theory might be important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p>

We plan to interview a sample of referring practitioners, to explore the referral process (e.g. how ‘vulnerability’ is conceptualized; how they identify mothers-to-be as suitable or ineligible for referral; what they think of ETPB and MB). Once a referral is made, mothers-to-be will be contacted by a member of the trial team who will obtain full consent to trial. This will cover consent for the process researcher to make initial contact with mothers-to-be, and partners, about interviews. Mothers-to-be are then randomized to MB plus CAU, ETPB plus CAU or CAU.</p>

The sample design was responsive to any recruitment issues that came to the fore in the early stages of the trial, as reported by THRIVE field workers or the outcomes evaluation team in field notes. We purposively sampled the highest and lowest practitioners, from a range of clinic settings, to understand why recruitment was working well in some settings and not in others. We planned interviews with the Heads of Midwifery at Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Ayrshire and Arran to gain further insights into the ways in which the local context and organisational culture might have impacted recruitment.</p>

The precise role the researcher takes within these groups is likely to be negotiated with the intervention developers, facilitators, and group participants. The process researcher will participate in three complete series of antenatal sessions with three different MB groups and three different ETPB groups.

Pawson and Tilley state that the aim of analysis of realist evaluation data is to ‘draw closer to explaining the complex signature of outcomes’ that an intervention may produce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. They suggest the starting point for analysis is to examine whether the theories about how each of the programmes work are supported or refuted by the data. They suggest that analysis is an ‘ever-repeating cycle’ of examining recognisable outcome variations, disentangling those that are less clear, and identifying unanticipated consequences of the intervention(s). This will involve constant comparison of emergent findings from the quantitative and qualitative studies outlined above.</p>
                  <p id="Par63">Descriptive accounts of the data will be prepared in the order of completion of each key ‘project’ (e.g. pre-training interviews; observations; interviews with pregnant women) as far as is practicable. Report writing is likely to be a critical part of the process evaluation since it will enable us to: 1) keep clear records of which substantive themes were identified and when; 2) present what we thought about the data at particular stages of the evaluation (as opposed to re-interpreting data retrospectively in light of later analyses); and 3) compare data more easily. Dissemination activities (e.g. presentations and publication) will be carefully timed to avoid contamination of the RCT.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par64">This trial is of great social importance since the overarching aim is to establish the most effective way to break the cycle of maladaptive coping leading to maltreatment of infants. The evaluation as a whole will make a substantial contribution to the evidence base for very early interventions appropriate to vulnerable pregnant women. The different theoretical perspectives of the interventions provide the opportunity to assess which theoretical approach has greatest empirical support. The mixed-methods realist process evaluation described here will help disentangle which components of each intervention work best, for whom, and why, and help explain the effects of antenatal and postnatal components of the intervention. The independence of the THRIVE team is important given that Triple P and Mellow Parenting’s involvement in the development and evaluation of their own programmes has attracted heavy criticism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par65">A trial of this scale and complexity inevitably presents practical and methodological challenges to both the trial and process teams. We have outlined here the work we hope to be able to do for THRIVE’s realist process evaluation. However, it will be important to remain flexible about the research design and be responsive to what happens within the RCT. It may be that emergent issues, or additional research problems, come to light during the course of implementation, meaning that planned methods have to be re-designed or that new measures have to be incorporated.</p>
