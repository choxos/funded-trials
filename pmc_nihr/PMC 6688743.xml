                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Haemophilia is a rare, inherited disorder in which blood does not clot normally, resulting in bleeding into joints and muscles. Long-term consequence is disabling joint pain, stiffness, muscle weakness, atrophy and reduced mobility. The purpose of this proposed feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to test the feasibility of an age-appropriate physiotherapy intervention designed to improve muscle strength, posture and the way boys use their joints during walking and everyday activities.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A small-scale two-centre RCT of a 12-week muscle strengthening exercise intervention versus usual care for young children with haemophilia will be conducted. Primary outcomes will be safety and adherence to the exercise intervention. Secondary outcomes will include recruitment, retention and adverse event rates, clinical data, muscle strength, joint biomechanics and foot loading patterns during walking, 6 min timed walk, timed-up-and-down-stairs, EQ-5D-Y, participants’ perceptions of the study, training requirements and relevant costs. Recruitment, follow-up, safety and adherence rates will be described as percentages. Participant diary and interview data will be analysed using a framework analysis. Demographic and disease variable distributions will be analysed for descriptive purposes and covariant analysis. Estimates of differences between treatment arms (adjusted for baseline) and 75% and 95% CIs will be calculated.</p>

As well as informing the design of the definitive trial, results of this study will be presented at local, national and international physiotherapy and haemophilia meetings as well as manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed journals. We will also share the main findings of the study to all participants and the Haemophilia Society.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Haemophilia is a rare, inherited disorder in which blood does not clot normally. Repeated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding into joints and muscles is the result; the ankle joint being the most common.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Long-term consequence is chronic arthropathy, a pattern of disabling joint pain, stiffness, muscle weakness, atrophy and reduced mobility.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> The introduction of prophylaxis with clotting factor concentrates has reduced the number of bleeding episodes experienced by children, changing their lifestyle and long-term outlook.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> However, evidence indicates that despite prophylaxis, boys still bleed one to two times per year, with relatively few bleeding episodes being required to initiate bone destruction, and in some cases, articular erosion is evident with no history of joint bleeding.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 7–9</xref> Furthermore, children are more susceptible to blood-induced damage than adults and once established is progressive and irreversible.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>It is well established that muscle weakness is associated with haemophilic arthropathy in adults,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and it is now becoming apparent that muscle strength is reduced in children, prior to the onset of clinical arthropathy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In a study of 10 adolescent and adult haemophiliacs with a history of unilateral knee bleeding, Falk <italic>et al</italic> found that strength of the knee extensors and flexors in haemophilic children was significantly weaker than those of the age-matched controls.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> More recently, Stephensen <italic>et al</italic> observed that despite normal clinical examinations and comparable levels of physical activity, young haemophilic boys with a history of ankle joint haemorrhage had significantly reduced dynamic muscle strength together with atrophy of the knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors when compared with age-matched and size-matched typically developing peers.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, muscle weakness of the leg is strongly correlated to muscle atrophy, reduced walking distances, slower ascent and descent of stairs, as well as reduced ankle joint motion, greater knee flexion motion and forces at the knee and ankle joint during walking.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref>

              <p>Therapeutic exercise is an important component of the management of other forms of arthropathy (eg, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis),<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and it would appear logical that exercise would be effective for people with haemophilia. There is growing evidence of the benefits of incorporating muscle strengthening exercise in their management of arthropathy.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is the view of clinicians that increases in muscular strength and postural control might improve motor performance and cardiovascular fitness, limit exaggerated end-range joint movement and promote optimal transfer of weight-bearing forces through joints, thereby minimising muscle imbalance, synovial impingement and associated haemarthroses or synovitis.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, there is a lack of evidence to support these assumptions. A recent Cochrane Review evaluating the safety and effectiveness of exercise for people with haemophilia reported four randomly controlled studies of an exercise intervention in children with the condition and concluded the studies were of low or very low quality, due to small sample sizes and potential bias.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, no paediatric study compared a muscle strengthening intervention to a control group or intervention without muscle strengthening exercises. Several studies compared two multicomponent exercise interventions that included broad muscle strengthening as well as treadmill walking and cycle ergometry, and it is not possible to determine the effect of muscle strengthening on muscle strength or its effect on physical function.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Furthermore, preadolescent and adolescent boys aged between 10 and 14 years were included in these studies, and it is not known if the groups were matched for pubertal status.</p>
              <p>Despite the apparent benefit, there is a lack of robust evidence to determine whether muscle strengthening exercise can improve or negatively affect outcomes for young children with haemophilia. The purpose of this proposed feasibility RCT is to test the feasibility of an age-appropriate physiotherapy intervention designed to improve muscle strength, posture and the way boys use their joints during walking and everyday activities.</p>

              <title>Methods and analysis</title>
              <p>The protocol version for this feasibility study is V.2—19 December 2017. The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> have been used to report the study protocol.</p>
              <sec id="s2a">
                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants will be invited from two haemophilia centres. Twenty boys with severe or moderate haemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors on prophylactic treatment with coagulation factor concentrate, aged 6–11 years, will be recruited. Boys with or without symptoms of joint damage (evaluated using the Haemophilia Joint Health Score and Haemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound score) will be eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria are as follows: von Willebrand disease, history of fracture or trauma to the lower limb, orthopaedic surgery, acquired brain injury or any other disturbance of the central nervous system, joint or muscle bleed in the lower limb in the past 6 weeks, presence of lower limb pain or unable to fully comply with verbal instructions.</p>
                <p>Participants will be identified from each Haemophilia Centre’s database of registered patients. The parents or guardians of eligible participants will be approached initially by the principle investigator at each site via telephone to provide a brief verbal explanation of the research study and ask if they would be happy to receive a patient information sheet. Should they be interested in participating in the study they will receive, by post, the patient information sheet (one for parents and a separate age-appropriate version for children) at least 1 week prior to their next clinic appointment. This will allow for a ‘cooling-off’ period of a minimum of 1 week for the potential participants. The researcher will then be available for questions by telephone or at the participant’s next clinic appointment.</p>
                <p>At their clinic appointment, the investigator will meet with the participant and parent/legal guardian to complete the consent form as appropriate. The investigator will further explain the study procedures, why they are being asked to consider including their child in this study and the associated risks and benefits of being included. They will then be given an opportunity to ask any further questions. The child/parent/ legal guardian will then be asked to confirm if the potential participant agrees to take part in the study. If consent is agreed, a parental consent form will be completed by the parent/guardian and a copy will be provided. If at any point during the study process the parent/guardian does not consent to inclusion in the study, then any data collected will be destroyed. Any decision to refuse or withdraw from the study will in no way influence the services that they receive. Once the child’s parent/guardian has given consent, the child must also indicate that they do not object to participating in the research activity. This participant ‘assent’ will be sought.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>Following written informed consent and screening of eligibility criteria, randomisation of eligible participants for the study will be performed with the online randomisation service <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sealedenvelope.com/">http://sealedenvelope.com/</ext-link>. Utilising the secure, centralised and independent service, participants will be randomly allocated into one of the two groups (treatment group 1 will receive a 12-week muscle strengthening exercise intervention; treatment group 2 will receive usual physiotherapy care for 12 weeks) on a ratio of 1:1. Allocation will be stratified by centre to ensure the same numbers of participants at each site are allocated to the two groups. The unblinded principal investigator at each site will be issued with a password to access the service to create a new randomisation for the study participants. Those allocated to treatment group 2 will be offered the intervention after their end of study follow-up assessment. Data will be collected prior to and immediately postintervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>It is impossible to blind those in receipt and those delivering the intervention as to the group allocation. However, it will be possible—although perhaps challenging—to blind the assessor as to group allocation. Consequently, we will attempt a single blind approach in which the participant and physiotherapists delivering the intervention will be encouraged to withhold their group allocation from the assessors collecting data. We will use a range of strategies, including instruction in the participant literature, intervention protocol and with frequent verbal prompts. In order to assess the efficacy of blinding, we will ask assessors to record which group they think participants have been allocated to at the end of each assessment. This will be presented as a binary forced choice. There are no circumstances under which it would be necessary to unblind assessors.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The intervention developed by expert clinicians and patients utilising a modified Nominal Group Technique (NGT) is a 24-session, 12-week programme designed as 2-week progressive levels (intensity and or load) with no more than 10 exercises in each session, taking 25–30 min to complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). The intervention aims to master movement control and emphasises body-weight strength development. Pictures of the exercises and instructions for each phase will be provided in 2-week exercise diaries. Participants will be asked to complete the exercises twice per week; once with the physiotherapist who will visit the participant at home and once supervised by their parents/guardian. Completion of exercises, along with treatment regimen, any adverse events and comments in relation to the exercise programme will be recorded in the exercise diary. They will also record participation in physical activities, including type, time and intensity. According to predetermined criteria (safe and competent), the physiotherapist will determine if it is appropriate for the participant to progress to the next exercise level. On return of the exercise diary every 2 weeks, participants will be provided with a gift voucher.</p>

This will include factor concentrate treatment, any physiotherapy or surgical intervention or advice that is recommended by the clinical care team. There are currently no standardised treatment recommendations for children without apparent joint damage. The researchers will not make or initiate any changes to routine treatment. Any change to or initiation of new treatment or intervention will be recorded and the treating clinician will determine whether it is appropriate for the participant to continue in the study.

                <p>Recruitment, follow-up, safety and adherence rates will be described as percentages. Participant diary and interview data will be analysed to identify factors that influence these rates and acceptability of the trial using a framework analysis. Interview data from physiotherapists will be analysed using a framework analysis to determine training required to deliver the intervention and collect outcome data. Feasibility of collecting healthcare cost data will be explored along with the resource consequences. Costs will be analysed and reported using descriptive statistics. Demographic and disease variable distributions will be analysed for descriptive purposes and covariant analysis. Walking variables will be normalised to leg length and muscle strength to body mass. Group mean and SD (median and interquartile range where appropriate) will be calculated and reported. Change from baseline data will be compared between groups at all study time points using analysis of covariance with baseline as a covariate and a factor for centre. Estimates of differences between treatment arms in the changes from baseline (adjusted for baseline) and 75% and 95% CIs will be calculated. Group mean and SD (median and interquartile range where appropriate) will be calculated preintervention and postintervention. These data will allow us to estimate the potential effect of the intervention and provide estimates of variability to inform the sample size required for a full RCT, as well as to refine the outcome measures by evaluating their responsiveness to changes in musculoskeletal health.</p>

                <p>Ten specialist haemophilia physiotherapists in the UK plus those experienced in sports injury were invited to take part in an NGT consensus discussion to share their experience and expertise to contribute to the development of the exercise intervention. Patients’ priorities, experience and preferences informed the study design, recruitment as well as the design and delivery of the intervention. The exercise programme was demonstrated to five boys with haemophilia and their parents who were members of the Haemophilia Society, National UK Patient Organisation. The parents and children were asked about what they thought about the exercises and whether they could undertake them on a regular basis, where they thought the best place was for undertaking them and how they would like to receive the information on the exercise programme. Parents and children were then asked questions about how they would feel about taking part in study testing the benefits of the exercises, issues around being allocated randomly into study groups and then questions about what would encourage the children to continue on the exercise programme with discussions focusing on types of rewards and incentivisation.</p>
