                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>There is no standard palliative care outcome measure for people with progressive long term neurological conditions (LTNC). This study aims to determine the psychometric properties of a new 8-item palliative care outcome scale of symptom burden (IPOS Neuro-S8) in this population.</p>

                  <title>Data and Methods</title>
                  <p>Data were merged from a Phase II palliative care intervention study in multiple sclerosis (MS) and a longitudinal observational study in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The IPOS Neuro-S8 was assessed for its data quality, score distribution, ceiling and floor effects, reliability, factor structure, convergent and discriminant validity, concurrent validity with generic (Palliative care Outcome Scale) and condition specific measures (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale; Non-motor Symptoms Questionnaire; Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire), responsiveness and minimally clinically important difference.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of the 134 participants, MS patients had a mean Extended Disability Status Scale score 7.8 (SD = 1.0), patients with an IPD, MSA or PSP were in Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage 3–5. The IPOS Neuro-S8 had high data quality (2% missing), mean score 8 (SD = 5; range 0–32), no ceiling effects, borderline floor effects, good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.7) and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass coefficient = 0.6). The results supported a moderately correlated two-factor structure (Pearson’s r = 0.5). It was moderately correlated with generic and condition specific measures (Pearson’s r: 0.5–0.6). There was some evidence for discriminant validity in IPD, MSA and PSP (p = 0.020), and for good responsiveness and longitudinal construct validity.</p>

                  <p>IPOS Neuro-S8 shows acceptable to promising psychometric properties in common forms of progressive LTNCs. Future work needs to confirm these findings with larger samples and its usefulness in wider disease groups.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Progressive long term neurological conditions (LTNC) are a group of irreversible and degenerative diseases of the nervous system that share some common characteristics, such as an increasing deterioration in neurological function over time, leading to increasing disability, cognitive impairment and dependence on others. As the disease progresses, complex physical, psychosocial and spiritual issues can arise which require palliative care and integrated care provisions from multiple agencies [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; the primary care focus also moves from cure to comfort, and the patient perspectives become central [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Little research is conducted on how best to integrate and coordinate these care services, and on the effectiveness of different care models among this population. One major barrier may be the lack of appropriate patient centred palliative care outcome measures (PCOM).</p>
              <p>A number of disease specific PCOMs are in existence for LTNCs, e.g. the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29)[<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39, PDQ-8) [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest) [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but all of these measures fail to adequately address the progressive nature of the LTNC and the resulting complex needs including palliative care needs. For example, none of the existing measures feature pain, dyspnoea and other distressing symptoms which are frequently reported by patients and are recommended as triggers for palliative care referral [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>The 10-item palliative care outcome scale (core POS) is a widely used PCOM for palliative care patients. However, it was designed for general palliative care purposes and when applied to LTNCs it is not as sensitive as the measure primarily focusses on key symptoms that require palliative care input [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A brief PCOM for palliative care needs, comprising five typical symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting, mouth problems and sleeping difficulty), was found to have satisfactory psychometric properties and was sensitive to change in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In an observational study in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a 20-item measure covering more comprehensive aspects of palliative care needs including symptoms was used [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It appears to be a promising tool but has not yet been through formal psychometric evaluation. Based on the well validated core POS [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], several commonly used condition specific POS symptom versions [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and clinical management guidelines for LTNCs [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we developed a new patient reported, integrated palliative care outcome measure that may be used to evaluate the outcome for people with progressive LTNC (IPOS Neuro).</p>
              <p>A key component in the IPOS Neuro is the symptom burden, a concept that encompasses both the severity of the symptoms and the patient's perception of the impact of the symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This study provides a formal evaluation of the psychometric properties of the symptom burden specifically associated with eight core symptoms in the IPOS Neuro. For the convenience of reference, we named this subscale version the IPOS Neuro-S8. We examined five psychometric aspects: data quality, floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency and test-retest reliability, cross-sectional construct validity. We also provided a preliminary validation on responsiveness and longitudinal validity, and an initial estimate of the minimally clinically important difference (MCID).</p>

                <p>Data was pooled from two studies: A) a randomised Phase II trial evaluating effectiveness of a short-term palliative care intervention in people severely affected by multiple sclerosis (MS)[<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; B) a longitudinal community based study in IPD, MSA and PSP [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both studies were conducted in South East England (including London, Kent and Sussex) with the MS trial primarily focusing on patients living in South East London. Patients were recruited from a neurosciences Centre based at King’s College Hospital (KCH). This Centre is the second largest regional neuroscience centre in the UK and serves an estimated population of 3.5 million people.</p>

                <title>Eligibility Criteria</title>
                <p>Patients with MS were included if their usual clinician deemed them to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs(i.e., palliative care needs); patients with a clinical diagnosis of IPD, MSA or PSP, who fell into Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stages 3–5 for IPD or equivalent motor disability for MSA and PSP [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
                <p>In both studies, patients with urgent needs for symptom control, or support, or who were deteriorating rapidly or dying were excluded. Patients living in nursing homes were also excluded. The MS trial patients were randomly allocated to either the control or the intervention group, and the two groups were comparable for all factors.

                  <p>A generic, patient-centred palliative outcome measure of symptom burden for people with progressive LTNCs. It is based on a validated symptom burden measure in advanced multiple sclerosis—palliative care outcome scale, 5 symptoms (POS-MS-5)[<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The POS-MS-5 assesses five key symptoms—pain, nausea, vomiting, mouth problems and sleeping difficulties over the past three days. To extend its use to the other neurological conditions, three further symptoms (breathlessness, spasms and constipation) prevalent in LTNCs are included to form the IPOS Neuro-S8 [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

We propose to incorporate it into a 45-item integrated palliative care outcome measure (IPOS Neuro), with 37 items asking about symptom experience and the remaining items asking about information needs, practical concerns, anxieties of the patient and family, and their overall feeling of being at peace (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165379.s002">S2 File</xref>).</p>

It has a 20-item physical impact scale and a 9-item psychological impact scale. Each item on the MSIS has a five-point response option (1–5): “not at all,” “a little,” “moderately,” “quite a bit” and “extremely.” Scores on the physical impact scale can range from 20 to 100 and on the psychological impact scale from 9 to 45, with lower scores indicating little impact of MS and higher scores indicating greater impact.

                  <p>The Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a single item 10-point clinician rated classification scheme used to assess physical disability for patients with MS [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The score range 0 (normal neurological exam) to 10 (death due to MS) with a step increase of 0.5. EDSS 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability, 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability. The modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale (HY) is a measure of the symptom progression for IPD, MSA and PSP, where stage 3, 4 and 5 respectively indicate “mild to moderate bilateral disease; some postural instability; physically independent”, “Severe disability; still able to walk or stand unassisted” and “Wheelchair bound or bedridden unless aided” [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The EuroQoL 5-Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) is a widely used generic instrument of health related quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It includes a descriptive part and a visual analogue scale for current health status (EQ-VAS, score range: 0 = the worst possible health status to 100 = the best possible health status). The descriptive part consists of five questions asking respondent’s current health in dimensions, i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Total scores and item specific scores were described using mean and standard deviation (SD). Individual items were examined for their frequency distribution and expressed as a percentage. Floor and ceiling effects were measured by the number of respondents receiving the low (0–2) and high range (30–32) summary scores, or the minimum (0) and maximum (4) score on the individual items, respectively. The floor and ceiling effects were deemed present when more than 15% of patients recorded the extreme scores [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Data quality was assessed by the completeness of responses.</p>
                <p>To evaluate the dimensions of the scale, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used. The EFA was conducted using the maximum likelihood method with promax rotation. The number of factors were determined by Spree plot and Kaiser’s criterion of an Eigen value&gt;1. A factor loading greater than 0.30 was considered significant. The factorial structure of the scale was verified by CFA [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Several fit indices were selected to assess the CFA model fit: chi-square test statistics, root-mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA), standardised root mean square residual (SRMR), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. RMSEA is a measure of the average of the residual variance and covariance; good models have RMSEA values that are at or less than 0.08. SRMR is a measure of the mean absolute value of the covariance residuals; values below 0.05 indicate good fit; CFI is an index that falls between 0 and 1, with values greater than 0.95 considered being indicators of good fitting models.</p>
                <p>The internal consistency of the scale was calculated with Cronbach's alpha coefficient (minimum acceptable value for alpha was 0.7) [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r, 95%CI) was used to evaluate the concurrent and the convergent validity. The IPOS Neuro-S8 was anticipated to be more strongly correlated with physical domain than non-physical domain, e.g. in MS, higher in MSIS physical than MSIS psychological, and in IPD, MSA &amp; PSP higher in NMSQuest than in PDQ-8. The interpretation of an absolute <italic>r</italic> value is as follows: ≤0.35—low or weak correlations, 0.36 to 0.67—modest or moderate correlations, and 0.68 to 1.0—strong or high correlations [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Discriminant validity was assessed using the known-groups validation method. Patients with higher level of disability were expected a priori to have a higher need for palliative care compared with patients with lower level of disability (EDSS&lt;8 versus 8+ in MS, HY3 versus HY4&amp;5 in IPD, MSA &amp; PSP, respectively). The mean difference between groups was compared with the two sample t-test.</p>
                <p>The test-retest reliability was explored with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), using the baseline and six-week data from the MS trial only. The responsiveness of the IPOS Neuro-S8 was evaluated using the change scores from baseline to 12 week follow up. Two aspects were assessed and compared using independent t-test: responsiveness to intervention (MS trial), and to disease trajectory by diagnosis (IPD versus MSA &amp; PSP). The responsiveness in MS sample was also analysed with effect size, interpreted using Cohen’s rules [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Longitudinal concurrent validity was tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient r on the change scores between measures.</p>
                <p>The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was derived using the distribution based approach [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The MCID was estimated by the standard error of measurement (SEM), one half and one third of the standard deviation of the change score [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Strictly speaking, SEM is a measure of the precision of the scale. As a precision measure, it has an arbitrary criterion (e.g. &lt;1/2 or 1/3 SD) to be deemed as appropriate [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, 1 SEM can be used as an approximation to the MID, along with other distribution-based methods for interpreting PROMs that produce dissimilar results [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>

All of the five response categories (0–4) were used in both conditions. Only a small proportion of patients scored the highest possible score (4) on the individual items. Other than nausea and vomiting, all items were roughly symmetrical around the score range 0–3. The mean total score of the IPOS Neuro-S8 was higher in IPD, MSA &amp; PSP than in MS (9.0 vs 6.0, p&lt;0.001); the average scores for the pain, shortness of breath, mouth problems and difficulty in sleep items followed a similar pattern and were significantly different between MS and IPD, MSA &amp; PSP (p&lt;0.05). No difference was found in spasms, nausea, vomiting and constipation scores by condition (p&gt;0.09).</p>

The test-retest analysis revealed the agreement between the baseline and the week 6 assessments was fair, with an ICC value of 0.58 (95%CI: 0.28–0.83).

                <p>The IPOS Neuro-S8 was responsive to change. This was more evident for patients with MS when comparing the patients in the intervention arm to those in the control arm. The t-test result was statistically significant (p = 0.030, t = 2.23, df = 46). The score change in IPD and the combined MSA &amp; PSP was in the same direction (mean change -0.45 and -0.88), but none of the changes reached significance level and the changes between groups were also not significant (p = 0.54, t = 0.62, df = 70). The effect size (ES) of the short-term palliative care intervention in MS patients was small (&lt;0.5). The MID was 3.1 as measured by SEM, greater than half and a third of SD (1.7 and 1.1).</p>
                <p>Longitudinally, the IPOS Neuro-S8 showed reasonable correlation with the core POS and with the disease specific measures. However, few of them reached statistical significance due to the sample size reduction caused by attrition.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study provided initial evidence on the cross sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity of the IPOS Neuro-S8, a new PCOM for people with progressive LTNCs. The IPOS Neuro-S8 showed acceptable to promising psychometric properties for use across neurological conditions, including advanced MS, late stage progressive IPD, PSP and MSA. While most studies involving severely ill people often suffer from small numbers [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], this evaluation was based on a relatively large sample (N = 134) therefore making it statistically more robust. The reliability of the IPOS Neuro-S8 appears adequate based on a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.66 with only 8 items, and supported by the two factor solution and their moderate correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.48) [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The IPOS Neuro-S8 is correlated reasonably well with the non-condition specific core POS. The core POS, as a multidimensional measure, only two out of its ten items are questions about pain and one other physical symptom. Therefore, a high correlation between IPOS Neuro-S8 and core POS is not anticipated.</p>
              <p>The correlation between IPOS Neuro-S8 and the diagnosis specific scales (MSIS-29, NMSQuest-30 and PDQ-8) was as expected (Pearson’s r range: 0.46–0.59), e.g. higher in physical and lower in psychological aspects. One reason for the moderate association may be that none of these measures were designed specifically for palliative care needs or for people severely affected by their illness; thus, intrinsically these measures may not capture the same needs as those captured by the IPOS Neuro-S8 [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The time frames used in the disease specific measures may be another reason. For example, NMQuest-30 and PDQ-8 ask symptoms experienced over the past month (or 4 weeks) and the MSIS is based on the past two weeks. In contrast, the IPOS Neuro-S8 asks about the past three days, aiming to capture the immediate care needs. For patients with neurological conditions who require palliative care input, the disease trajectory is more unpredictable and more frequent assessments are recommended as best practice [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our results support the continued development and validation of the IPOS Neuro-S8. If proved by further validation studies, it can be a useful outcome measure in research settings, particularly for patients with progressive LTNCs, as it is brief and shows promising psychometric properties. It may also facilitate the clinical use of the IPOS Neuro-S8 as a screening measure in non-palliative care settings, to increase the opportunities of identifying patients with palliative care needs and trigger the referral process. In palliative care clinical practice, it may be used to monitor care intervention outcomes and disease progression. At the organisation level, it can be a simple, standardised auditing tool. It also makes patient’s self-monitoring possible.</p>
              <p>Several limitations are noted in our study. We could not test face validity and content validity in this study, but all eight items of the IPOS Neuro-S8 were important for patients and relevant in clinical practices [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0165379.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although having been able to assess a range of psychometric properties, this evaluation was based on two existing datasets using very different study designs–a longitudinal observational study and a randomised clinical trial. Previous research revealed that eligibility criteria for patient selection in clinical trials can be very restrictive, therefore these patient samples may not be as representative as those from observational studies [<xref rid="pone.0165379.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Some very “severe” patients were excluded as well–less than 5% got the highest possible score on the individual items; we did not have data for other prevalent neurological conditions that may have a higher need for palliative care, e.g. motor neuron diseases. As a consequence of the high attrition rate and the loss of statistical power, the longitudinal psychometric evaluation should be treated as preliminary. Furthermore, the psychometric testing in this study was primarily based on classical test theory; it may be of interest to compare how the results differ from those derived from modern measurement theories.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In conclusion, our results demonstrated the acceptable to promising psychometric properties of the IPOS Neuro-S8 in two common long term neurological conditions. The IPOS Neuro-S8 showed good data quality, borderline floor effects and no ceiling effects, good internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability. A moderately correlated two-factor structure was confirmed. The IPOS Neuro-S8 was moderately correlated with both the generic core POS and the condition specific measures (MSIS-29, NMSQuest-30, PDQ-8). There was evidence for discriminant validity in IPD, MSA and PSP (by disease progression). Preliminary evidence suggested good responsiveness and longitudinal construct validity but needs further research. Future work needs to confirm these findings with larger samples and its usefulness in wider LTNC disease groups.</p>
