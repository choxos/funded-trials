                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Family-based physical activity (PA) interventions present a promising avenue to promote children’s activity; however, high-quality experimental research is lacking. This paper describes the protocol for the FRESH (Families Reporting Every Step to Health) pilot trial, a child-led family-based PA intervention delivered online.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>FRESH is a three-armed, parallel-group, randomised controlled pilot trial using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio with follow-up assessments at 8 and 52 weeks postbaseline. Families will be eligible if a minimum of one child in school Years 3–6 (aged 7–11 years) and at least one adult responsible for that child are willing to participate. Family members can take part in the intervention irrespective of their participation in the accompanying evaluation and vice versa.</p>
                  <p>Following baseline assessment, families will be randomly allocated to one of three arms: (1) FRESH; (2) pedometer-only or (3) no-intervention control. All family members in the pedometer-only and FRESH arms receive pedometers and generic PA promotion information. FRESH families additionally receive access to the intervention website; allowing participants to select step challenges to ‘travel’ to target cities around the world, log steps and track progress as they virtually globetrot. Control families will receive no treatment. All family members will be eligible to participate in the evaluation with two follow-ups (8 and 52 weeks). Physical (eg, fitness and blood pressure), psychosocial (eg, social support) and behavioural (eg, objectively measured family PA) measures will be collected at each time point. At 8-week follow-up, a mixed methods process evaluation will be conducted (questionnaires and family focus groups) assessing acceptability of the intervention and evaluation. FRESH families’ website engagement will also be explored.</p>

              <p>Targeting families may, therefore, be one avenue to increase PA among children.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> In particular, parents can influence their children’s health behaviours through a variety of mechanisms, including their general parenting style, parenting practices (eg, rule setting, behavioural consequences and establishing behavioural expectations) and their control over the home environment.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Parents can also act as gatekeepers to activity<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and can play an important role in increasing their child’s PA through role modelling or parental support.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, little PA promotion research has been conducted in the family compared with the school setting.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Previous research suggests that: (1) involving family members is critical for sustained behaviour change<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 16 17</xref> and (2) home-based PA interventions that include the family are potentially more effective than those requiring the family to travel to community or other intervention locations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Many studies, however, only focus on promoting child PA instead of considering the family as a unit that may work together to change behaviour.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
              <p>Our recent feasibility study<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> was among the first PA interventions to specifically target whole family engagement. The findings showed that it was feasible and acceptable to deliver and evaluate a family-targeted PA promotion intervention with high acceptability from participating families. Building on this work, this paper describes the protocol for the Families Reporting Every Step to Health (FRESH) pilot trial. The aims of this pilot study are to: assess the feasibility and acceptability of the revised recruitment strategy, intervention and outcome evaluation (after feasibility testing<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); study long-term retention; and explore further intervention optimisation and preliminary effectiveness.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>FRESH is a three-armed, parallel-group, randomised controlled pilot trial using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio with follow-up assessments at 8 and 52 weeks postbaseline (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Following baseline assessment, families will be randomly allocated to one of three arms: (1) FRESH arm; (2) pedometer-only arm or (3) no-intervention control arm. All family members in the pedometer-only and FRESH arms receive pedometers and generic family PA promotion information. FRESH families additionally receive access to the intervention website. Control families will be asked to carry on as normal.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Families are deemed eligible to participate in this study if there is consent from at least one child in school Years 3–6 (aged 7–11 years, hereafter referred to as the index child) and at least one adult responsible for the index child. The adult must live with the index child in the main household (ie, the index child’s primary residence as indicated by the parent). There are no restrictions placed on family type (eg, single parent, shared parenting and inclusion of extended family living in the main household) and no maximum number of participants per family. All participants need to be able to perform light-intensity PA (eg, walking), have access to the Internet and understand the English language sufficiently well to provide informed consent. Family members are able to take part in the intervention irrespective of their participation in the accompanying evaluation and vice versa. Exclusion criteria related to participation in specific assessments are outlined below with the outcome measures.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>Families will be recruited from rural Norfolk and Suffolk, counties in East Anglia, UK. Norfolk is 2074 square miles in size and had a total estimated population of 898 400 in 2017 (most recent estimate)<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and Suffolk is 1466 square miles and had a total estimated population of 756 978 in 2017 (most recent estimate).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> According to the Norfolk and Suffolk county councils,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> approximately 53% and 42% of the Norfolk and Suffolk populations, respectively, are classified as living in a rural area. Based on the Office for National Statistics<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> classification, ‘rural’ will be defined as having a postcode falling in a small town, village, hamlet or dispersed settlement. In both counties, existing inequalities have been identified, including PA, obesity and other indicators of child ill health, school readiness and attainment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 29 30</xref>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>The recruitment of families is known to be particularly challenging<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 13</xref> and we have described specific recruitment challenges we have encountered previously.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> To overcome these challenges, we will use a multifaceted recruitment strategy, including targeting adults (parents) directly and messaging, which focuses on the wider benefits of research participation (eg, spending more time together as a family) as opposed to solely focusing on increasing PA or obesity prevention.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Recruitment will be undertaken over an estimated 3 months (with a recruitment rate of ~20 families/month), using two main strategies that target adults and children, as summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>. The first strategy involves recruitment in the school setting and the second in employer-based and community-based settings (eg, Brownies/Cubs, community centres and general practitioner surgeries). Alternative recruitment settings may also be explored (eg, online/traditional media) if needed, and will follow the same procedure as the second strategy. For logistical purposes, we aim to find recruitment settings located roughly within an hour commute of Cambridge, UK.</p>

                  <title>Recruitment protocol</title>
                  <p>To recruit schools, employers and community-based organisations, we will aim to first contact those in lead positions (eg, head teachers, human resources, health and well-being leaders, and heads of community-based organisations). An information pack detailing the purpose of the study and all procedures will be included in our correspondence with lead personnel. Also included in the information pack and recruitment material will be a link to a recruitment video, which was developed with families following the suggestion of participants in the FRESH feasibility study.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> For school-based recruitment, verbal or written approval will be sought to send home study leaflets with children, circulate our leaflet to parents online and send an online reminder to parents approximately 2 weeks later. We will also seek permission to present to Key Stage 2 students (Years 3–6; aged 7–11 years) at a scheduled school assembly. Similarly, for employer-based and community-based recruitment, we will seek approval to circulate our study information to employees or members either online or hardcopy. In all cases, interested parents are asked to express interest by contacting the study team via email or a free-to-call telephone number, after which eligibility will be assessed and study information emailed. A baseline assessment appointment will be made with families still interested in participating. Written informed consent will be obtained for all participating adults and written parental consent and child assent for each participating child during this appointment, prior to baseline assessments.</p>

                  <p>To encourage retention, we will remain in regular contact with all participating families (through intervention website and newsletter/holiday cards), and offer measurement incentives and study feedback. Each individual participant will receive a £5 voucher on return of the accelerometer and global positioning system (GPS) monitors at each measurement time point. Retention will be monitored by study group and demographic characteristics to observe whether differences in retention occur.</p>

                <p>Randomisation will occur after baseline assessments and the unit of randomisation will be at the family level (ie, the index child and all participating family members). Families will be randomised in blocks of six by an independent statistician using a computer-generated algorithm produced with Stata V.14 and stratified by county (ie, Norfolk or Suffolk). The random allocation sequence will be implemented via a database created in-house on Microsoft Access by independent data management staff. A study coordinator will use the database after baseline to determine which study arm a family is allocated to.

                <p>A week after baseline measures, each family allocated to the FRESH arm will have an hour-long kick-off meeting, scheduled in the family home (or an alternative location can be arranged) with a facilitator. The facilitator will introduce families to the intervention components, accompanying materials (eg, family action planner) and distribute pedometers. Families will also receive their first of four pieces of generic walking information (described in protocol for pedometer-only families section below). However, the main goals of this meeting are to familiarise families with the intervention website and their pedometers and to prompt weekly ‘family time’ meetings (described in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) in which they complete their action planners and select a new challenge city to ‘walk to’ on the FRESH intervention website. All families will receive a follow-up phone call a week after their kick-off meeting to discuss any issues or ask any clarifying questions. Participant-initiated distant support will continue to be available, where participants can contact the research team with questions or to report issues (eg, website bugs and pedometer issues).</p>
                <p><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides a detailed description of the FRESH intervention components. In each family, the index child (or children, if multiple) will be designated the role of ‘team captain(s)’, which involves taking the lead in selecting challenges and uploading steps online. Evidence suggests that children may act as change agents to elicit changes to the psychosocial environment<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; therefore, promoting the index children to the role of family ‘team captain(s)’ may strengthen child buy-in, perceived autonomy and improve intervention fidelity. All family members will be given pedometers, wearing them for as long as possible daily, to capture their steps during challenges. Pedometers are simple to use, convenient, and are associated with effective interventions for increasing parent-child PA<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. After the challenge week is over, whether a family completes their challenge or not, they will receive personalised competence reinforcement messages praising their effort online and hardcopy letters (addressed and mailed to all participating children in the family). In addition, online and tangible rewards will be given to participating children after a challenge week. If a family does not complete a challenge, they will progress to a hidden city along their challenge route, as opposed to the city they chose, and will still receive a reinforcement message and reward, as described. Families with an ongoing challenge will receive email reminders to log steps 3 days and 1 day before an impending challenge ends. After every challenge week, the described cycle will repeat starting with the next ‘family time’ meeting. Following assessments at 8 weeks postbaseline, families retain access to the website and their pedometers, and can continue using it for as long as they like. There will also be continued support in terms of website updates (eg, leaderboard and parental resource updates) and participants will continue to receive competence reinforcement letters and rewards.</p>

Information will continue to be emailed to families (pedometer-only and FRESH arm families) fortnightly on four occasions. The information will provide families with tips to get walking daily and games that can be played while walking. Control families will be asked to carry on as normal and will not receive access to the intervention website, pedometers or any generic information.</p>

                  <p>To assess PA, participants will be asked to simultaneously wear an ActiGraph GT3X+ triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph LLC; Pensacola, Florida, USA) and QStarz Travel Recorder BT1000X GPS monitor (QStarz; Taipei, Taiwan). The accelerometer will be initialised to record data at a sampling rate of 50 Hz, while the GPS will be set to record a location every 10 s. The devices will be worn on each hip during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. A valid week will be defined as a minimum of 420 min/day from 3 days over the 7-day measurement period; however, this definition may be altered depending on participant compliance. Non-wear will be defined as ≥90 min consecutive zeros using the vector magnitude. Raw accelerometer counts will be downloaded and integrated into 5 s epochs. Evenson <italic>et al</italic> cut-points<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> have been recommended to estimate PA intensity in youth<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> and Troiano <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> cut-points for adults; these cut-points will be used in this study. In addition, family co-participation in PA will be measured by matching accelerometer and GPS data using Java. Novel methodological work will be completed to compute minutes of PA per day when family members are together at a given location from the matched data.</p>
