                  <p id="Par1">Preterm birth is associated with significant mortality and morbidity for mothers and babies. Women are identified as high risk for preterm birth based on either previous medical/pregnancy history or on ultrasound assessment of the cervix. Women identified as high risk can be offered a cervical cerclage (a purse string stitch) around the cervix (neck of the womb) to reduce the risk of preterm birth. In women who have a cervical cerclage, the procedure can be performed using either a monofilament (single-stranded) or braided (woven) suture material. Both suture materials are routinely used for cervical cerclage and there is uncertainty as to which is superior.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A multicentre, open, randomised controlled superiority trial of 2050 women presenting at obstetric units, deemed to be at risk of preterm birth and already scheduled to have a cervical cerclage as part of their standard care. Inclusion criteria include singleton pregnancies and an indication for cervical cerclage for either a history of three or more previous mid-trimester losses or premature births (≤ 28 weeks), insertion of cervical sutures in previous pregnancies, a history of mid trimester loss or premature birth with a (current) shortened (≤ 25 mm) cervix, or women whom clinicians deem to be at risk of preterm birth either by history or the results of an ultrasound scan. Exclusion criteria include women who have taken part in C-STICH previously, are aged less than 18 years old at the time of presentation, require a rescue cerclage, and are unwilling or unable to give informed consent and in whom a cerclage will be placed by any route other than vaginally (e.g. via an abdominal route). Following informed consent, women are randomised on a 1:1 basis to either monofilament or braided suture, by minimisation. The primary outcome is pregnancy loss (miscarriage and perinatal mortality, including any stillbirth or neonatal death in the first week of life), and secondary outcomes include the core outcome set for preterm birth trials.</p>

                <p id="Par21">Preterm birth (PTB) is one of the major global challenges in obstetrics and neonatology. An early birth puts survivors at risk of serious long-term disabilities and these outcomes pose a significant burden on parents as well as having economic implications on health services. Second trimester miscarriage and preterm birth form a continuum with the underlying cause often multifactorial and complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cervical weakness is one cause of late miscarriage and preterm birth; this can be treated by a cervical cerclage.</p>
                <p id="Par22">A cervical cerclage can be performed either with a monofilament or braided suture material; both sutures are routinely used by clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A monofilament suture may be superior at preventing miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death through the prevention of early delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

The trial should then be introduced by a suitable qualified staff member who is delegated to discuss the trial and recorded on the delegation log to do so. A Patient Information Sheet (PIS) should be given to the women. Consent should be informed and voluntary with time for questions and reflection. Adequate time should be allowed for consideration of participation in the trial before the cerclage procedure is undertaken. There is no pre-agreed specified time to consent.</p>

                  <p id="Par61">Following randomisation, a cerclage will be placed using either a monofilament or braided suture. Both types of suture used in C-STICH are standard surgical materials already in use. The suture material used must be CE marked for this purpose. The MHRA have confirmed that C-STICH is not classed as a device trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par62">If randomised to the comparator braided group, the cervical cerclage should be performed using any appropriate braided suture type. There are different brands of each suture material and whilst the trial does not specify which brand a surgeon should use, the use of Mersilene® is encouraged in the braided group in order to standardise the suture types as far as possible. Mersilene® is a nonabsorbable, braided, sterile surgical suture composed of poly-ethylene terephthalate.</p>

Ongoing preterm birth prevention management, e.g. progesterone, antibiotics, and tocolytics, will be at the discretion of the clinician providing care and can all be used as required. Intention to commence progesterone will be included in the minimisation algorithm.</p>

                <p id="Par113">The original sample size for C-STICH was informed by a meta-analysis of audit data, with allowance for the fact that this evidence was non-randomised. The pregnancy loss rate was 7.1% with monofilament sutures compared to 19% with braided sutures, a relative reduction of 66% (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.63). A total sample of 326 women would be sufficient to detect a difference of this size with 90% power (<italic>p</italic>=0.05). However, we inflated this to a total sample target of 900 (including inflation for an attrition rate of 2.5%) which enabled us to detect a more plausible relative reduction of 41% (19% with braided to 11.2% with monofilament) with 90% power (<italic>p</italic>=0.05).</p>
                <p id="Par114">Given that there was uncertainty around the estimates used for the rates of pregnancy loss, it was agreed that the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) would monitor the overall (pooled) event rate throughout the study to assess any deviation from the original sample size assumptions. In July 2017, the DMEC disclosed that the current estimate of the pooled event rate was lower than anticipated and may affect the trials ability to detect a difference between groups, should one exist. They advised that to maintain 90% power to detect the same relative reduction of 41% the sample size should be increased to 2050 women.</p>

Should suture allocation need to be recorded in the hospital notes to facilitate the placement of the correct randomised suture (e.g. as cerclage is to be performed later by a different clinician), this is acceptable. The suture material used should also be documented within the operation notes. As far as possible, it is preferable that the patient and microbiologists should remain unaware of the treatment allocation. Duration of blinding should continue, where possible, until both mother and baby have reached their respective trial end points (i.e. final follow-up). The primary outcome (miscarriage, stillbirth, termination of pregnancy and neonatal death) is objective and thus should minimise any bias incurred by lack of blinding.</p>

Regardless of whether completing paper or electronic CRFs, only site staff designated the responsibility on the delegation log can do so—in instances where paper CRFs are completed, site staff must provide their name and signature, which BCTU staff will check against delegation log records at the point of receipt. Where data entry is conducted by BCTU staff, data entry quality checks will occur according to predetermined parameters laid out in the Data Management Plan. In addition, a Data Validation Plan will guide BCTU staff in the generation of queries where, for instance, data provided by sites may not fall into any typically expected parameters. The ability to enter or edit site data on the database will only be provided to those site individuals designated the responsibility by their PI on the delegation log. These individuals will receive usernames and passwords and will only have the ability to edit data relating to their site(s). Similarly relevant BCTU staff will also be provided with usernames and passwords but will have the ability to enter/edit data on behalf of all sites, though may only do so in accordance with the Data Management Guidelines. The database will maintain an audit trail of all data entered by any username. BCTU will also adopt a centralised approach to monitoring data quality and compliance. The trial database has been constructed specifically for the trial data and will include range and logic checks to prevent erroneous data entry. Independent checking of data entry will be periodically undertaken on small sub-samples (i.e. data entry quality checks as mentioned above). The trial statistician will regularly check the balance of allocations by the stratification variables.</p>

Alternatively, new evidence might emerge from other sources that any one treatment is definitely more, or less, effective than any other. To protect against this, during the main period of recruitment to the study, interim analyses of the primary outcome and adverse events will be supplied, in strict confidence, to an independent DMEC along with updates on results of other related studies, and any other analyses that the DMEC may request. The DMEC will advise the chair of the TSC if, in their view, any of the randomised comparisons in the trial have provided both (a) “proof beyond reasonable doubt” that for all, or for some, types of patient one particular treatment is definitely indicated or definitely contraindicated in terms of a net difference in the major endpoints and (b) evidence that might reasonably be expected to influence the patient management of many clinicians who are already aware of the other main trial results. The TSC can then decide whether to close or modify any part of the trial. Unless this happens, however, the TMG, TSC, the investigators, and all the central administrative staff (except the statisticians who supply the confidential analyses) will remain unaware of the interim results.</p>

There may be unexpected serious adverse reactions associated with monofilament or braided sutures when used in cervical cerclage. Monofilament or braided sutures have been used to treat cervical cerclage for many years and there is no reason to believe there are adverse biochemical reactions intrinsic to the material of the suture thread, but there may be adverse events arising from the biomechanical properties of the thread. There are also known adverse events of cerclage irrespective of suture material used. It is the responsibility of investigators to notify serious adverse events to the C-STICH Trial Office, who will forward all SAEs to the Chief Investigator. It is the remit of the sponsor or their representative to expedite to the ethics committee within 15 days any serious adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related and unexpected. Where SAEs are expedited to the Research Ethics Committee (REC), the PI will be informed by the C-STICH study team of the RECs response and any actions to be taken.</p>

If a participant dies, any post-mortem findings must be provided to BCTU. BCTU will report all deaths to the DMEC, CI and sponsor for continuous safety review. All SAEs deemed to be related and unexpected will be expedited to the REC. **Life-threatening in the definition of a SAE refers to an event in which the mother was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Important AEs that are not immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospitalisation, but may jeopardise the pregnancy or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, should also be considered serious. All SAEs for the participant and their baby need to be reported to the Trials Office (the only exception being those SAEs listed as exempt from reporting). Assuming they meet the definition of serious, examples of reportable SAEs (which should be reported on the SAE form) are, but not limited to, the following:

                  <p id="Par184">There are some SAEs associated with the trial that are already well characterised, where it is highly unlikely that the trial will reveal any new safety information relating to the intervention. Recording of these SAEs will not affect the safety of participants or the aims of the trial. As such, the following SAEs are exempt from reporting to the Trials Office:

                  <p id="Par199">A miscarriage, preterm delivery, or neonatal death 48 h after the cerclage procedure will be considered an outcome and not a SAE and should be reported on the pregnancy outcome form. If a site reports an SAE that the Trials Office believes exempt from reporting, clarification will be sought by the Trials Office, with the site asked to review their reasons for reporting. If both parties then agree the SAE is exempt from reporting, the SAE will no longer require processing, though a record of it and the relating correspondence should be kept by both parties. AEs should still be recorded locally in accordance with local practice/SOPs. Reportable SAEs, for both the participant and their baby, from the day of randomisation into the trial, until the defined end of the trial, should be reported to the Trials Office. Whether observed directly or reported by the patient, these must be recorded on CRF 7 within 24 h of the research staff becoming aware of the event. The PI (or nominated investigator (medically qualified doctor) delegated the relevant responsibility on the delegation log) is required to assign causality, signing the SAE form to confirm their assessment. Where an SAE form has been completed by someone other than an investigator, the original SAE form will be required to be countersigned by the Investigator to confirm agreement with the causality. Assessment of causality must be made by an investigator (definition above) according to the definitions in the table below. If an investigator is unavailable, initial reports without causality assessment should be submitted to BCTU by a healthcare professional within 24 h, but must be followed up by medical assessment as soon as possible thereafter, ideally within the following 24 h. If information is missing from the initial SAE report, including ongoing events where there is as yet no end date, the SAE should be followed up until resolution or stabilisation of the event. Follow-up information should ideally be provided on a new SAE Form, using the SAE reference number provided by the BCTU trials team. For all reportable SAEs, the CI or delegate will review the SAE and provide their own assessment of causality. In cases where either the reporting investigator or the CI believes the SAE related the CI or delegate will also perform an expectedness assessment. This expectedness assessment will be based on the clinical judgement/experience of the CI or delegate, with reference where appropriate, to those SAEs listed as expected below. For expectedness assessment purposes, the following will be considered as expected SAEs:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par200">Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, miscarriage, neonatal death within 48 h of cervical cerclage procedure</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par201">Antepartum haemorrhage requiring suture removal</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par202">Postpartum haemorrhage greater than 1500ml</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par203">Retained suture thread at cerclage removal</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par204">Postnatal readmission with infection/sepsis</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par205">Where there is a discrepancy between the local assessment of causality and the assessment from the CI, neither will be downgraded and both opinions will be documented. If either party believes an SAE related, and the CI believes it unexpected, the SAE will be reported to the REC within 15 days.

If an AE is mistakenly reported as an SAE, the site will be informed and the SAE will be downgraded to an AE.

                  <p id="Par211">1. The safety or physical or mental integrity of the participants of the trial; or</p>
                  <p id="Par212">2. The scientific value of the trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par213">If a potential serious breach is identified by the Chief investigator, Principal Investigator, or BCTU, the C-STICH Trial Office must be notified within 24 h. It is the responsibility of the Chief Investigator to determine whether the incident constitutes a serious breach and if so, to assess the impact of the breach on the scientific value of the trial. BCTU will report serious breaches to the sponsor and to the Research Ethics Committee as necessary.</p>

                <p id="Par214">The conduct of the trial will be according to the principles of the International Committee on Harmonisation, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (ICH GCP). All centres will be required to sign an Investigator’s Agreement, detailing their commitment to accrual, compliance, GCP, confidentiality, and publication. Deviations from the agreement will be monitored and the TSC will decide whether any action needs to be taken, e.g. withdrawal of funding, suspension of centre. The Trial Office will ensure researchers not employed by an NHS organisation hold an NHS honorary contract for that organisation. The Trial has a favourable ethical opinion from Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Multi-centre REC, confirming that the trial design respects the rights, safety, and wellbeing of the participants. The Comprehensive Research Network will conduct governance checks and assess the facilities and resources needed to run the trial, in order to give host site permission. For sites in Scotland and Wales, the Trial Office is able to help the local PI in the process of the site specific assessment by completing much of Site Specific Information section of the standard IRAS form as possible. For sites in England, the trial office is able to help with Trust confirmation of capacity and capability by helping to complete the Statement of Activities and Schedule of Events. The local PI will be responsible for liaison with the Trust management with respect to locality issues and obtaining the necessary signatures at their Trust. Once the following has taken place for each Trust, Health Board, or NHS Board, the Trial Office will send a folder containing all trial materials to the local Principal Investigator along with a letter of activation, and potential trial participants can then start to be approached:

                <p id="Par222">Within 90 days after the end of the study, the CI will on behalf of the Sponsor ensure that the REC is notified that the study has finished. If the study is terminated prematurely, those reports will be made within 15 days after the end of the study.</p>
                <p id="Par223">The CI will supply the Sponsor with a summary report of the clinical study, which will then be submitted to the REC within 1 year after the end of the study.</p>
