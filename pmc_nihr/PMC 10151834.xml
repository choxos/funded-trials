                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Accurate and timely dispatch of emergency medical services (EMS) is vital due to limited resources and patients’ risk of mortality and morbidity increasing with time. Currently, most UK emergency operations centres (EOCs) rely on audio calls and accurate descriptions of the incident and patients’ injuries from lay 999 callers. If dispatchers in the EOCs could see the scene via live video streaming from the caller’s smartphone, this may enhance their decision making and enable quicker and more accurate dispatch of EMS. The main aim of this feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of using live streaming to improve targeting of EMS.</p>

                  <p>The SEE-IT Trial is a feasibility RCT with a nested process evaluation. The study also has two observational substudies: (1) in an EOC that routinely uses live streaming to assess the acceptability and feasibility of live streaming in a diverse inner-city population and (2) in an EOC that does not currently use live streaming to act as a comparator site regarding the psychological well-being of EOC staff using versus not using live streaming.</p>

                  <p>The study was approved by the Health Research Authority on 23 March 2022 (ref: 21/LO/0912), which included NHS Confidentiality Advisory Group approval received on 22 March 2022 (ref: 22/CAG/0003). This manuscript refers to V.0.8 of the protocol (7 November 2022). The trial is registered with the ISRCTN (ISRCTN11449333). The first participant was recruited on 18 June 2022.</p>
                  <p>The main output of this feasibility trial will be the knowledge gained to help inform the development of a large multicentre RCT to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of the use of live streaming to aid EMS dispatch for trauma incidents.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Emergency medical services (EMS) provide emergency medical care at the scene of incidents before patients are conveyed to hospital (eg, blood transfusions and emergency anaesthesia). To save lives and prevent long-term disability, timely and accurate dispatch of pre-hospital resources is critical.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Evidence suggests trauma patients should receive definitive care within 1 hour of the incident (The ‘Golden Hour’), otherwise the risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Where severe injury is suspected by EMS (eg, major trauma), specialist paramedics in critical care and/or helicopter EMS (HEMS) may be dispatched to the scene to care for the patient and/or convey the patient to hospital.</p>
                <p>When a 999 call is made in the UK, the dispatchers in the emergency operations centre (EOC) need to decide which resources to send to the scene by gathering information about what has happened and the clinical state of the patient(s). The dispatchers rely on 999 callers and other bystanders to accurately relay essential information.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, lay public 999 callers can sometimes provide inaccurate information due to language barriers, subjectivity, the emotional impact of being at the scene and limited medical training or knowledge.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Dispatch response is often recognised as a weak link in the EMS chain,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> often involving either under-resourcing or over-resourcing.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref> Previous studies have shown that up to 50% of HEMS (air ambulance) dispatch and 25% of road ambulance dispatch for suspected trauma patients are not appropriate.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref>

                <p>It is vital that EMS are being dispatched to incidents where they are needed due to finite and often limited resources. If dispatchers were able to see the patient and scene via live video streaming through a 999 callers’ smartphone camera, it could be easier to make more accurate and timely decisions about dispatch of EMS.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is evidence that video-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has the potential to improve patient outcomes,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–16</xref> but there is a lack of research evidence to support the use of live video streaming for EMS dispatch for trauma.</p>
                <p>NHS policies and the Department of Health and Social Care actively encourage the use of innovative technologies to improve patient and healthcare outcomes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The benefits of using video in other healthcare settings are growing, for example, for remote healthcare consultations,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref> but evidence is sparse in relation to use in pre-hospital settings, despite being used routinely in some ambulance services. There is some limited evidence of the benefits and acceptability of live streaming to aid HEMS dispatch,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but its impact on clinical or economic outcomes has not yet been evaluated. Also, the psychological impact of dispatchers viewing the scene and impact on 999 callers has not been investigated for exposure to trauma.</p>

                <p>Main research question: is it feasible to conduct a future randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of using GoodSAM live video streaming to improve targeting of emergency medical resources? The overall aim of this research is to assess the feasibility of implementing and evaluating GoodSAM live streaming in a definitive RCT.</p>
                <p>The objectives are:</p>

                <title>Trial design and study setting</title>
                <p>The SEE-IT Trial is a feasibility RCT with a nested process evaluation in an EOC in South East England (South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust). This study includes two observational substudies (1) in an EOC that routinely uses live streaming to assess acceptability and feasibility of use of live streaming in a diverse inner-city population (London Ambulance Service NHS Trust) and (2) in an EOC that does not currently use live streaming to act as a comparator site regarding the psychological well-being of EOC staff using versus not using live streaming (East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust). In addition, 11 NHS hospital trusts covered by the main trial site will be involved in identifying and consenting patients for access to their medical records including: University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust; St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Medway NHS Foundation Trust; Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust; Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust; East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust; East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust; Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust; King’s College University Hospital NHS Trust; Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
                <p>The study was planned to run for 18 months from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2023. Pressures on the NHS and ambulance services meant the start of the trial period was delayed 4 months to June 2022. Therefore, the overall study end date is now 31 July 2023. There were nine amendments made to the protocol during the feasibility study, outlined in the protocol on the NIHR study webpage.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

Control shifts will follow standard care ambulance dispatch protocol with a 999 caller using a telephone (voice only) and the call taker using NHS Pathways ambulance dispatch tool.</p>
                <p>In the intervention arm, a live streaming technology called GoodSAM Instant-on-Scene<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> will be tested. The technology allows a 999 caller to stream live video footage from the scene of an incident to the EOC. 999 calls allocated to intervention will initially follow the standard NHS Pathways dispatch protocol until ambulance dispatch prioritisation has been determined. EMS will be dispatched as normal, without delay. The call handler in the EOC will then transfer the caller to the HEMS dispatcher or critical care paramedic (CCP) and live streaming will be activated. EMS resource allocation may be adjusted following this.</p>
                <p>If at any point the dispatcher feels they do not want to view the scene (eg, due to psychological impact of viewing the scene) or it is not safe to continue, the 999 caller will be thanked for their help and the call will be ended.

Staff in the main trial site will be invited to partake in interviews through the survey. 999 callers in the main trial site will be sent a text message after the eligible incident inviting them to participate in a survey 6–8 weeks post incident and a subsequent interview. Patients will be approached for consent for their medical records to be accessed up to 3 months after the incident has occurred.</p>
                <p>In the observational substudy, EOC staff will be observed using GoodSAM live streaming over a 3-month period and invited to partake in interviews. 999 callers will be invited to partake in the survey within 1 week of the incident they called 999 for and subsequently invited to partake in an interview about their experiences of using GoodSAM live streaming.</p>

                <p>We estimate there will be approximately 250 trauma incidents (including 300 patients) over the six observation weeks (125 allocated to intervention), which will allow for an estimate of true event rate within precision of ±0.75 events per day; and allow estimation of speed to appropriate response with an SE of &lt;5%. These sample size estimations are based on convenience sampling over the six defined trial observation weeks. We estimate there will be approximately 350 lay public 999 callers (250 from the main trial site and 100 from the observational substudy) and up to 202 EOC staff (86 from the main trial site, 30 from the observational substudy and 86 from the third EOC).</p>

For eligible calls in the main trial site, the computer-aided dispatch (CAD) number(s) relating to the incident will be recorded by the RP as the identifier to share with the conveying hospital to approach for consent. Informed consent will be sought from either the patient, their consultee or the patient’s parent or guardian (either in the hospital before discharge or via telephone, email or post) in all hospital trusts included in the trial (trauma units and major trauma centres covered by the EOC). RPs may consent patients in person with assistance from the hospital to identify the patient(s). Approval has been granted by the Confidentiality Advisory Group (Section 251 application) to access medical records for casualties who die before consent can be sought (and where there is not a power of attorney in place for that individual). National data opt-out status will be checked for all deceased patients.</p>

The text message will include a link to the participant information sheet (PIS), consent form and contact details for the research team. A reminder text message will be sent to 999 callers within 1 week of the incident. Those who participate in the survey will be invited to partake in an interview and selected to represent a range in demographics (age, ethnicity, gender), type of incident they witnessed and evidence or not of psychological harm from survey responses.</p>
                  <p>In the inner-city observational substudy, at the end of the call (once resources have been dispatched) 999 callers will be asked for permission to store their name and number to share with the researcher to be invited to participate in the study. Those who consent will initially be contacted by phone so the researcher can explain the study and ask their permission to send them further details about the study via text message or email. The researcher will then send a text message or email with a link to the PIS and consent form, which once completed will re-direct to the survey. Reminder texts/emails will be sent up to 1 week after the incident. Only those who participate in the survey will be invited to partake in an interview.</p>
