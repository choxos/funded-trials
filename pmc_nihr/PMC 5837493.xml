Scott et al. report that minocycline reduces neuroinflammation months and years after injury but increases a blood marker of neurodegeneration, suggesting that persistent neuroinflammation has reparative effects long after injury.AbstractSurvivors of a traumatic brain injury can deteriorate years later, developing brain atrophy and dementia. Traumatic brain injury triggers chronic microglial activation, but it is unclear whether this is harmful or beneficial. A successful chronic-phase treatment for traumatic brain injury might be to target microglia. In experimental models, the antibiotic minocycline inhibits microglial activation. We investigated the effect of minocycline on microglial activation and neurodegeneration using PET, MRI, and measurement of the axonal protein neurofilament light in plasma. Microglial activation was assessed using 11C-PBR28 PET. The relationships of microglial activation to measures of brain injury, and the effects of minocycline on disease progression, were assessed using structural and diffusion MRI, plasma neurofilament light, and cognitive assessment. Fifteen patients at least 6 months after a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury received either minocycline 100 mg orally twice daily or no drug, for 12 weeks. At baseline, 11C-PBR28 binding in patients was increased compared to controls in cerebral white matter and thalamus, and plasma neurofilament light levels were elevated. MRI measures of white matter damage were highest in areas of greater 11C-PBR28 binding. Minocycline reduced 11C-PBR28 binding (mean &#x00394;white matter binding = &#x02212;23.30%, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;40.9 to &#x02212;5.64%, P = 0.018), but increased plasma neurofilament light levels. Faster rates of brain atrophy were found in patients with higher baseline neurofilament light levels. In this experimental medicine study, minocycline after traumatic brain injury reduced chronic microglial activation while increasing a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that microglial activation has a reparative effect in the chronic phase of traumatic brain injury.traumatic brain injurymicrogliaminocyclineneurodegenerationpositron emission tomographyNational Institutes of Health10.13039/100000002Wellcome Trust10.13039/100004440) -->

                <p>Survivors of a traumatic brain injury can deteriorate years later, developing brain atrophy and dementia. Traumatic brain injury triggers chronic microglial activation, but it is unclear whether this is harmful or beneficial. A successful chronic-phase treatment for traumatic brain injury might be to target microglia. In experimental models, the antibiotic minocycline inhibits microglial activation. We investigated the effect of minocycline on microglial activation and neurodegeneration using PET, MRI, and measurement of the axonal protein neurofilament light in plasma. Microglial activation was assessed using <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 PET. The relationships of microglial activation to measures of brain injury, and the effects of minocycline on disease progression, were assessed using structural and diffusion MRI, plasma neurofilament light, and cognitive assessment. Fifteen patients at least 6 months after a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury received either minocycline 100 mg orally twice daily or no drug, for 12 weeks. At baseline, <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding in patients was increased compared to controls in cerebral white matter and thalamus, and plasma neurofilament light levels were elevated. MRI measures of white matter damage were highest in areas of greater <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding. Minocycline reduced <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding (mean Δwhite matter binding = −23.30%, 95% confidence interval −40.9 to −5.64%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.018), but increased plasma neurofilament light levels. Faster rates of brain atrophy were found in patients with higher baseline neurofilament light levels. In this experimental medicine study, minocycline after traumatic brain injury reduced chronic microglial activation while increasing a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that microglial activation has a reparative effect in the chronic phase of traumatic brain injury.</p>

              <p>Survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) can deteriorate years after injury (<xref rid="awx339-B51" ref-type="bibr">Whitnall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), developing post-traumatic epilepsy (<xref rid="awx339-B1" ref-type="bibr">Annegers <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), brain atrophy (<xref rid="awx339-B7" ref-type="bibr">Cole <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid="awx339-B48" ref-type="bibr">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) (<xref rid="awx339-B32" ref-type="bibr">McKee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The protracted effects of TBI suggest a window of opportunity for disease-modifying therapy that extends beyond the acute setting, where many clinical trials have failed (<xref rid="awx339-B30" ref-type="bibr">Maas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
              <p>The long-term clinical effects of TBI are associated with chronic microglial activation (CMA) (<xref rid="awx339-B41" ref-type="bibr">Ramlackhansingh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and progressive neurodegeneration (<xref rid="awx339-B45" ref-type="bibr">Sidaros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), both of which are seen in white matter tracts affected by the injury (<xref rid="awx339-B19" ref-type="bibr">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Animal models (<xref rid="awx339-B26" ref-type="bibr">Loane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), neuropathology (<xref rid="awx339-B19" ref-type="bibr">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and molecular imaging (<xref rid="awx339-B41" ref-type="bibr">Ramlackhansingh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) show that CMA can persist for years after TBI. However, its significance is unclear (<xref rid="awx339-B42" ref-type="bibr">Ransohoff, 2016</xref>). Microglia are implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="awx339-B13" ref-type="bibr">Gentleman, 2013</xref>). In rodent TBI models, microglia have a predominantly pro-inflammatory activation phenotype (<xref rid="awx339-B26" ref-type="bibr">Loane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, studies in non-human primates in the chronic phase suggest a reparative role (<xref rid="awx339-B33" ref-type="bibr">Nagamoto-Combs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="awx339-B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
              <p>PET ligands targeting the translocator protein (TSPO), upregulated in activated microglia, can be used to quantify CMA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="awx339-B40" ref-type="bibr">Raghavendra Rao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). We previously demonstrated CMA up to 17 years after TBI using the TSPO ligand <sup>11</sup>C-PK11195 (<xref rid="awx339-B41" ref-type="bibr">Ramlackhansingh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Second-generation TSPO ligands, including <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 (<xref rid="awx339-B36" ref-type="bibr">Owen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), have a higher signal-to-noise ratio, promising more accurate quantification.</p>
              <p>A successful treatment strategy for TBI might be to target CMA. The antibiotic minocycline has anti-inflammatory properties and is neuroprotective in models of TBI (<xref rid="awx339-B46" ref-type="bibr">Siopi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and other neurological disorders (<xref rid="awx339-B39" ref-type="bibr">Plane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). One mechanism of action is the inhibition of microglial activation (<xref rid="awx339-B18" ref-type="bibr">Homsi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In models of acute TBI, minocycline reduces microglial activation and improves early functional outcomes (<xref rid="awx339-B46" ref-type="bibr">Siopi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Clinical trials in acute stroke and spinal cord injury have shown positive results (<xref rid="awx339-B24" ref-type="bibr">Lampl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B6" ref-type="bibr">Casha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, trials in neurodegenerative diseases have had mixed results (<xref rid="awx339-B39" ref-type="bibr">Plane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>): the largest trial, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), reported a negative effect on functional outcomes (<xref rid="awx339-B15" ref-type="bibr">Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
              <p>We examined the role of CMA in TBI and the effects of minocycline on microglia and neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that: (i) levels of CMA predict subsequent neurodegeneration; (ii) minocycline reduces CMA; and (iii) inhibiting CMA reduces neurodegeneration. To test these hypotheses, we combined <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 PET with MRI measures of neurodegeneration (atrophy) and measurement of plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL), a marker of axonal injury (<xref rid="awx339-B25" ref-type="bibr">Ljungqvist <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and active neurodegeneration (<xref rid="awx339-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bacioglu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p>

Patients were then randomized to one of two arms (2:1 ratio), balanced for age, gender, <italic>TSPO</italic> genotype and time since injury. One group (<italic>n</italic> = 10) received minocycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks; the other (<italic>n</italic> = 5) had no drug. Patients were followed up at 12 weeks (<sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 PET, MRI, NFL and cognitive testing) and 6 months (MRI, NFL, cognitive testing). The study was approved by the West London and GTAC NHS Research Ethics Committee (13/LO/1813). All participants provided informed consent.

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Patients were recruited from TBI clinics in London, UK. Inclusion criteria were: age between 20–65 years; history of a single moderate-severe TBI (Mayo classification) (<xref rid="awx339-B31" ref-type="bibr">Malec <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) at least 6 months prior; no significant neurological or psychiatric illness prior to the TBI. Exclusion criteria were: use of any medication, substance or alcohol abuse that would interfere with the study or compromise safety; contraindication to MRI scanning; contraindication to PET or arterial line insertion. Three separate groups of healthy controls, age- and gender-matched to the TBI group, were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="awx339-T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="awx339-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Screening included genotyping for the rs6971 (Ala147Thr) polymorphism in the <italic>TSPO</italic> gene. This produces three classes of binding affinity for TSPO: high-, mixed- and low-affinity binders (<xref rid="awx339-B37" ref-type="bibr">Owen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Low-affinity binders were excluded as they show negligible specific binding of <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28. PET controls were matched to patients for <italic>TSPO</italic> genotype.

                <p>Study procedures were carried out at the Hammersmith Hospital campus, Imperial College London (London, UK) and Imanova Centre for Imaging Sciences (London, UK). <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 radiopharmaceutical preparation and quality control were performed as in <xref rid="awx339-B36" ref-type="bibr">Owen <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>. <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 was injected as an intravenous bolus [mean ± standard deviation (SD) 340.04 ± 18.07 MBq] over ∼20 s at the start of a 90 min dynamic PET acquisition. Radial artery blood samples were collected for generation of an arterial plasma input function. Acquisition and reconstruction of PET imaging data, arterial blood sampling, analysis of plasma metabolism, and measurement of blood and plasma radioactivity concentrations were performed as previously described (<xref rid="awx339-B36" ref-type="bibr">Owen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
                <p>All participants underwent high resolution T<sub>1</sub> MRI. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired along 64 non-colinear directions with b = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> and four averages with b = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, with echo time/repetition time 103/9500 ms, 64 contiguous slices, field of view 256 mm, and voxel size 2 × 2 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup>. Baseline structural MRI scans were reviewed by a senior neuroradiologist.</p>
                <p>A neuropsychological battery assessed cognitive domains often previously observed to be impaired after TBI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), as in <xref rid="awx339-B41" ref-type="bibr">Ramlackhansingh <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>. A venous blood sample was taken on the morning of the 12-week visit for a trough drug level. Plasma concentrations of minocycline were determined using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (Antimicrobial Reference Laboratory, Southmead Hospital, Bristol). Venous blood samples were taken for measurement of NFL using the highly-sensitive single molecule array platform (Simoa; Quanterix Corp) (<xref rid="awx339-B22" ref-type="bibr">Kuhle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).

                <p>Motion correction of dynamic PET images, co-registration of PET with structural MRI, and generation of metabolite-corrected plasma input function were performed using previously published methods (<xref rid="awx339-B36" ref-type="bibr">Owen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The Logan graphical method (<xref rid="awx339-B27" ref-type="bibr">Logan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990)</xref>, using a metabolite-corrected plasma input function, 5% fixed blood volume and a linear start time (T*) at 35 min, was used to generate parametric maps of volume of distribution (V<sub>T</sub>).</p>
                <p><sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 V<sub>T</sub> was the primary outcome measure for assessing within-subject drug effects. As in previous studies (<xref rid="awx339-B28" ref-type="bibr">Loggia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 distribution volume ratio (DVR), the ratio of regional V<sub>T</sub> to whole brain V<sub>T</sub>, was used as the primary outcome measure for cross-sectional PET analysis to reduce between-subject variability. Analyses were repeated using cerebellar or cortical grey matter as alternative pseudo-reference regions, to determine if the choice of reference region influenced the findings.</p>
                <p>T<sub>1</sub> MRI images were segmented into grey matter and white matter using SPM12, and warped to an average group template using a diffeomorphic non-linear registration (DARTEL) (<xref rid="awx339-B2" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Separate templates were created for cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Templates were registered to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 space. Each individual <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 parametric map (DVR or V<sub>T</sub>) was registered to its corresponding subject-space T<sub>1</sub>, then the individual flow-fields and template transformation from DARTEL were applied to produce MNI space images, without modulation. Normalized maps were spatially smoothed [8 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) kernel].</p>
                <p>Images of change in V<sub>T</sub> (ΔV<sub>T</sub>) were calculated as: <italic>ΔV<sub>T</sub></italic> = <italic>V<sub>T</sub></italic>(12 weeks) − <italic>V<sub>T</sub></italic>(baseline). These ‘delta’ images were calculated after within-subject registration of the 12-week parametric map to the baseline map. Delta images were then normalized to MNI space. Similar results were obtained when delta images were computed in MNI space instead. Lesions apparent on T<sub>1</sub> MRI were manually segmented and voxels excluded from all imaging analyses.</p>
                <p>Regions of interest were generated from automated volumetric segmentation of T<sub>1</sub> images using Freesurfer (Desikan-Killiany atlas) (<xref rid="awx339-B9" ref-type="bibr">Fischl, 2012</xref>). Co-registered <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 parametric maps (V<sub>T</sub>/DVR) were sampled from regions of interest (cerebral white matter, thalamus and cortical grey matter). To improve sampling accuracy, region of interest masks were intersected with thresholded tissue probability maps (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.5). Co-registered <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 parametric maps were sampled from the regions of interest and mean values calculated.</p>

                <p>For cross-sectional voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>), T<sub>1</sub> images were segmented into grey and white matter, and warped to MNI space including modulation by the Jacobian determinants derived from DARTEL. The normalized segmentations were then smoothed (8 mm FWHM) and masked (group mean <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.2). Total grey and white matter tissue volumes, and intracranial volume, were calculated using SPM12.</p>
                <p>Longitudinal volume changes were calculated as follows: (i) annualized change in grey matter and white matter volumes were calculated as: %Δ/year<italic> = </italic>([volume(6-month)/volume(baseline)] − 1) × 100) / follow-up interval (years); (ii) an unbiased within-subject pairwise longitudinal registration approach provided a voxelwise measure of change (<xref rid="awx339-B3" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner and Ridgway, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). In SPM12, deformation fields mapping baseline and 6-month T<sub>1</sub>s to a within-subject average template T<sub>1</sub> were computed, from which annualized Jacobian determinant images were created, representing the per-year contraction or expansion of each voxel. Within-subject templates were segmented into grey matter and white matter. The segmentations and individual Jacobian determinant images were normalized to MNI space using DARTEL (as above), without modulation, and smoothed (8 mm FWHM). Each Jacobian determinant image was then multiplied by grey matter and white matter tissue segmentation images to yield tissue-specific Jacobian determinant images for voxelwise analysis.</p>
                <p>Diffusion-weighted images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>) were preprocessed using standard methods (<xref rid="awx339-B21" ref-type="bibr">Kinnunen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and tensor-based registration performed using DTI-TK (<xref rid="awx339-B52" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). For cross-sectional analysis, normalization of tensor images was performed by bootstrapping subject volumes to the IXI Aging Template then refining the group template using affine followed by non-linear diffeomorphic registration (<xref rid="awx339-B52" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A final study template was registered to MNI space (IIT Human Brain Atlas) using an affine registration step. All subject images were then transformed to MNI space by combining the subject-to-group and group-to-MNI transformations. Maps of fractional anisotropy were generated from normalized tensor images and analysed using tract-based spatial statistics (<xref rid="awx339-B21" ref-type="bibr">Kinnunen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>

                <p>Group characteristics were compared using independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests (for age), Fisher’s exact test (gender, <italic>TSPO</italic> genotype) and Mann-Whitney U-tests (time since injury, post-traumatic amnesia duration, visit intervals). Group differences in cognitive performance were assessed using either independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests (where data were not normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test), with Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction.</p>
                <p>Voxelwise cross-sectional comparison of <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 DVR, tissue volumes (VBM) and DTI metrics were performed using non-parametric permutation tests (<xref rid="awx339-B35" ref-type="bibr">Nichols and Holmes, 2002</xref>) in FSL (10 000 permutations). For all analyses, age was added as a nuisance covariate. For comparisons of <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28, <italic>TSPO</italic> genotype was included as a covariate and, for VBM analysis, intracranial volume. All results were cluster corrected using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) (<xref rid="awx339-B49" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Nichols, 2009</xref>) with family-wise error rate of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. For <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 region of interest analysis, mean DVR for each region of interest was compared between groups using ANCOVA, with DVR as the dependent variable and genotype and age as covariates, and Fisher LSD <italic>post hoc</italic> tests.</p>
                <p>A mean composite processing speed measure for patients was calculated using separate test scores in this domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) converted to Z-scores with controls as a reference (control Z-score mean = 0 and SD = 1). Positive scores always corresponded to better performance (i.e. faster reaction time).</p>
                <p>In patients, partial correlation was used to assess whether DVR in regions of interest with increased binding were associated with time since injury or composite processing speed, with genotype and age as nuisance covariates. Bonferroni correction was used.</p>
                <p>Plasma NFL values were log-transformed before group comparison using an independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test. Partial correlation was used to assess whether baseline NFL and the white matter region of interest <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 DVR were associated, with genotype as a nuisance covariate. Spearman’s correlation was used to assess association with time since injury, duration of PTA and information processing speed.</p>
                <p>To enable direct comparison of modalities, maps of <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 DVR, tissue volumes and DTI metrics were converted to Z-score maps (Z-maps). Z-maps were calculated for each patient and modality, using controls as a reference (control Z-map mean = 0 and SD = 1). To create Z-maps of <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 DVR, adjusted for age and genotype, first a voxelwise regression was performed in FSL on baseline patient and control DVR maps, with age and genotype as covariates. Second, Z-maps for each patient were computed using the voxelwise formula: <italic>Z</italic> = (patient’s residual − mean of residuals in controls) / SD of residuals in controls. A similar procedure was used to create Z-maps of (modulated) tissue volumes (adjusted for age and intracranial volume) and DTI metrics (adjusted for age). All maps were generated from smoothed MNI space images. Then, to directly compare <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 DVR with other modalities within a patient, firstly masks of voxels with ‘high’ DVR (thresholded at <italic>Z</italic> &gt; +2) and ‘normal’ DVR (−1<italic> &lt; Z</italic> &lt; +1) were defined. Then, the two masks were used to sample the Z-maps of the other modalities. The mean Z-scores sampled using high and normal masks were then compared in patients using a paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>
                <p>Longitudinal changes in tissue volumes were assessed in patients without modelling treatment group. To assess longitudinal changes in total tissue volumes, a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used on %Δ/year measures (above), for grey matter and white matter separately. For longitudinal changes in Jacobian determinant, voxelwise analyses on Jacobian determinant images were performed using one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (Δ&gt;0,Δ&lt;0) equivalents of non-parametric permutation tests.</p>
                <p>Voxelwise differences in baseline <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding between treatment groups were assessed using non-parametric permutation tests (as above). Changes in V<sub>T</sub> between baseline and 12 weeks in the two groups were first analysed separately using one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test equivalent non-parametric permutation tests on ΔV<sub>T</sub> images, with <italic>TSPO</italic> genotype as a nuisance covariate. The two groups were then directly compared using permutation tests, with genotype as a covariate. For region of interest analysis, the effect of minocycline versus no drug on V<sub>T</sub> for each region of interest was first assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA, with time as the within-subjects factor (baseline and 12-week) and treatment group (minocycline or no drug) and genotype as between-subjects factors. <italic>Post hoc</italic> tests were planned after significant group × time interactions. %ΔV<sub>T</sub> and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each region of interest were calculated in each group and tested for significance using a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. A partial correlation assessed whether drug levels were associated with regional ΔV<sub>T,</sub> with genotype as a nuisance covariate. The effect of treatment group on change in separate cognitive measures was assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA, as above.</p>

              <p>We found CMA after moderate-severe TBI was associated with white matter damage months and years after injury. Areas with higher CMA showed greater progressive atrophy. The antibiotic minocycline reduced microglial activation but increased levels of plasma NFL, a marker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that microglial activation has a reparative effect in the chronic phase of TBI.</p>
              <p>Increased <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding was seen in damaged and progressively atrophying white matter. This extended our previous observation of microglial activation in the thalamus and white matter using another TSPO PET ligand, <sup>11</sup>C-PK11195 (<xref rid="awx339-B41" ref-type="bibr">Ramlackhansingh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Microglia might be chronically stimulated by the persistence of myelin breakdown products from the initial injury (<xref rid="awx339-B19" ref-type="bibr">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B8" ref-type="bibr">Faden and Loane, 2015</xref>), but TSPO PET alone does not clarify their functional effects. Microglial function <italic>in vivo</italic> is heterogeneous and can involve pro-inflammatory and reparative activation phenotypes (<xref rid="awx339-B17" ref-type="bibr">Holmin and Mathiesen, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B33" ref-type="bibr">Nagamoto-Combs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="awx339-B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B26" ref-type="bibr">Loane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B42" ref-type="bibr">Ransohoff, 2016</xref>). Therefore, depending on the functional phenotype, inhibiting microglia with minocycline would be expected to have distinct effects. Experimental animal work has not clarified this issue, as evidence exists for both damaging and reparative phenotypes in the months after injury (<xref rid="awx339-B17" ref-type="bibr">Holmin and Mathiesen, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B33" ref-type="bibr">Nagamoto-Combs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="awx339-B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B26" ref-type="bibr">Loane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), and the function of activated cells is likely to change over time (<xref rid="awx339-B23" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Hence, CMA might be either damaging or reparative in the chronic phase. Our findings suggest the latter, because NFL increased following minocycline treatment that dramatically reduced <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding. However, because the time course of microglial activation phenotype evolves after injury, minocycline treatment at an earlier time point may well produce different effects. Hence, drug treatment may need to be targeted to the dominant microglial phenotype at a specific time since injury, rather than simply attempting to inhibit microglial activation. In addition, the cross-sectional PET findings may also have differed in a patient cohort studied closer to the time of injury.</p>
              <p>Our results suggest that inhibition of CMA after TBI promotes neurodegeneration. Plasma NFL is highly correlated with CSF NFL (<xref rid="awx339-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B14" ref-type="bibr">Gisslén <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B44" ref-type="bibr">Shahim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B16" ref-type="bibr">Hansson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), and elevations in plasma NFL have been observed in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref rid="awx339-B10" ref-type="bibr">Gaiottino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bacioglu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B14" ref-type="bibr">Gisslén <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Here we show that plasma NFL is elevated in the chronic phase after moderate–severe TBI, and that plasma levels of NFL increased significantly after 12 weeks of minocycline treatment, before returning to baseline after stopping the drug. A direct relationship between CMA and NFL is made more likely by the negative correlation observed between changes in <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding and NFL levels. In addition, the link between NFL and progressive neurodegeneration is strengthened by the presence of a negative correlation between baseline NFL and longitudinal atrophy, such that higher baseline NFL predicted greater white matter atrophy over the subsequent 6 months.</p>
              <p>Studies in non-human primates suggest a trophic role for CMA after TBI, which may explain our observations (<xref rid="awx339-B33" ref-type="bibr">Nagamoto-Combs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="awx339-B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Long-term follow-up in a primate model of TBI confirmed the presence of persistent microglial activation up to 12 months after injury, which was associated with expression of factors that support cell survival, including BDNF and ERK1/2. In contrast, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 expression were reduced months after injury, suggesting that the more immediate pro-inflammatory response had subsided. In a primate spinal cord injury model, microglial activation was observed at sites of synaptic sprouting, suggesting a role in promoting axonal regeneration after TBI (<xref rid="awx339-B34" ref-type="bibr">Nagamoto-Combs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
              <p>Although effects of minocycline on microglia have been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> and in preclinical models (<xref rid="awx339-B11" ref-type="bibr">Garrido-Mesa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>a</italic></xref>), ours is the first study to demonstrate directly that standard clinical doses of 200 mg/day provide an adequate CNS concentration to inhibit microglial activation in the brain. Animal studies have typically used much higher doses (equivalent by weight to ∼3–7 g/day in humans), which are likely to be toxic in humans (<xref rid="awx339-B39" ref-type="bibr">Plane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The reduction in <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding provides evidence that the standard clinical dose has a pharmacodynamic action on humans comparable to the ∼50% reduction in microglial activation seen following administration of pharmacological doses to mice after experimental TBI (<xref rid="awx339-B18" ref-type="bibr">Homsi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Here we show a ∼25% reduction in <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 V<sub>T</sub> after minocycline. If activated microglia accounted for all of the displaceable TSPO binding, this suggests a ∼50% reduction in activated microglia, once the non-specific element of <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28 binding has been accounted for (<xref rid="awx339-B36" ref-type="bibr">Owen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Clinical studies of minocycline in other neurological conditions have reported varying results. Two stroke trials showed improved motor outcomes following minocycline treatment in the acute phase (<xref rid="awx339-B24" ref-type="bibr">Lampl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="awx339-B38" ref-type="bibr">Padma Srivastava <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, the largest neurological study of minocycline showed an adverse effect on the progression of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref rid="awx339-B15" ref-type="bibr">Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), a condition in which elevated NFL is a poor prognostic indicator (<xref rid="awx339-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Minocycline was found to have detrimental effects on functional rating scores in a dose-independent manner (<xref rid="awx339-B15" ref-type="bibr">Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), suggesting that microglia could have a net reparative phenotype and that inhibition accelerated neurodegeneration. It is also possible that the disparate clinical effects of minocycline are mediated through mechanisms other than microglial modulation.</p>
              <p>There are a number of potential limitations to our study. First, we powered our study for <sup>11</sup>C-PBR28, which resulted in sample sizes too small for the assessment of some other outcome measures. This is particularly true for clinical measures of the drug effect, which we have not reported because of this issue. A much larger clinical trial would be required to study the clinical effects of minocycline, but our results suggest that this would be inappropriate if the aim is to reduce long-term neurodegenerative effects of CMA. A larger sample size may also permit exploration of other effects on microglial activation and neurodegeneration, such as gender, age and genetic factors. Second, the study was open label, so investigators were not blinded to an individual’s treatment. However, this is unlikely to have affected our objective neuroimaging and fluid biomarker outcome measures, and is mitigated by the repeat assessment of patients following drug cessation. We have focused on the effects of minocycline on microglia, but the drug is known to have a broad range of actions (<xref rid="awx339-B12" ref-type="bibr">Garrido-Mesa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>b</italic></xref>). This potentially complicates the interpretation of our NFL findings, but our results suggest that an effect of the drug on white matter microglia is linked to the increase in plasma NFL seen after treatment. It will be important for future human and basic science work to investigate the causative links between CMA and neurodegeneration measured using markers such as NFL. Analysis of cytokines in blood, in parallel with NFL measurements, may have helped to explain the action of minocycline. However, whilst a recent review of methods to measure neuroinflammation after brain injury highlights some studies linking blood cytokines and functional outcomes (<xref rid="awx339-B50" ref-type="bibr">Thelin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), peripheral blood markers that directly track microglial function are not established. Finally, our patients had focal lesions, which could potentially have affected our neuroimaging analyses. However, to control for the possible effects of lesions, we excluded lesioned areas from the analysis. Here and in our previous work using <sup>11</sup>C-PK11195 we found binding was reduced in visible lesions, which would have biased the analysis against detecting increases.</p>
              <p>Several of our results are potentially clinically important. We have demonstrated CMA accompanying markers of progressive damage following brain trauma. These findings highlight that TBI is not a static insult, but rather a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease. Many TBI survivors make a poor recovery or deteriorate long after the injury, but it is not currently possible to identify patients who are likely to do so. A biomarker of disease progression would allow patients at risk of poor outcomes to be identified, and would facilitate clinical studies of long-term sequelae of TBI. Our results suggest that combining plasma NFL and neuroimaging measures of progressive white matter atrophy may be a promising approach. This may have clinical utility, for example, in quantifying the accumulated brain injury sustained as a result of multiple mild TBIs, such as during a professional sporting career, and estimating the risk of developing post-traumatic dementia, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (<xref rid="awx339-B32" ref-type="bibr">McKee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Finally, our results suggest that there may be positive effects of chronic microglial activation after TBI, and that promoting a trophic phenotype for microglia may improve the recovery of damaged axons.</p>
