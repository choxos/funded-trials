                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) experience urine leakage with physical activity. Currently, the interventional treatments for SUI are surgical, or endoscopic bulking injection(s). However, these procedures are not always successful, and symptoms can persist or come back after treatment, categorised as recurrent SUI. There are longstanding symptoms and distress associated with a failed primary treatment, and currently, there is no consensus on how best to treat women with recurrent, or persistent, SUI.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A two-arm trial, set in at least 20 National Health Service (NHS) urology and urogynaecology referral units in the UK, randomising 250 adult women with recurrent or persistent SUI 1:1 to receive either an endoscopic intervention (endoscopic bulking injections) or a standard NHS surgical intervention, currently colposuspension, autologous fascial sling or artificial urinary sphincter. The aim of the trial is to determine whether surgical treatment is superior to endoscopic bulking injections in terms of symptom severity at 1 year after randomisation. This primary outcome will be measured using the patient-reported International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence - Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF). Secondary outcomes include assessment of longer-term clinical impact, improvement of symptoms, safety, operative assessments, sexual function, cost-effectiveness and an evaluation of patients’ and clinicians’ views and experiences of the interventions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par54">Urinary leakage with physical effort or exertion, such as coughing, sneezing or exercising, is known as stress urinary incontinence (SUI), and primary SUI affects a quarter (16–35%) of women after pregnancy. Until recently, the most common surgical treatment for primary SUI was a midurethral tape (MUT), an operation which helps to support the bladder exit (urethra). Alternative surgical options include colposuspension, autologous fascial sling or artificial urinary sphincter (AUS). Endoscopic urethral bulking injections are a minimally invasive surgical alternative. In many cases symptoms can persist or come back, known as persistent or recurrent SUI. The treatment options generally used are the same as those for primary SUI.</p>
                <p id="Par55">Little is known about the chance of cure or potential treatment-related problems for those women with ongoing SUI after treatment. There is also no consensus on how to treat women who have had failed primary continence surgery. A study by Tincello et al. surveyed patients and clinicians about this question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. “No consensus on what is the correct treatment” was achieved by a clinician survey and patient views were highly individual. There is a problematic lack of high-quality evidence for the best treatment for recurrent SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par56">The underlying mechanism of SUI may be either:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par57"><italic>Urethral hypermobility</italic>, where the sphincter muscle is fundamentally normal, but is prevented from functioning due to impairment of its ligamentous support, or</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58"><italic>Intrinsic sphincter deficiency</italic>, where the sphincter muscle is not normal, because the nerves to the muscle, or the muscle itself, are damaged. Consequently, there is weakened resistance by the sphincter.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par59">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines NG123 on Urinary Incontinence in Women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] suggests that women whose primary surgical procedure for SUI has failed (including women whose symptoms have returned) should be referred to tertiary care for assessment (such as repeat urodynamic testing, including additional tests such as imaging and urethral function studies), and discussion of treatment options by the multidisciplinary team.</p>
                <p id="Par60">In primary SUI, NICE recommends pelvic floor muscle training and, if this fails, surgery is an option. Surgical failure rates after MUT procedures are variable and range from approximately 8 to 57% at 5 years of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The problem may reflect persistent hypermobility or emergence of sphincter deficiency. This affects quality of life (QoL), ability to work and has substantial cost impact. Women with recurrent SUI commonly express desire to return to normal life, but they also wish to minimise the severity of surgery or complications. Up to 17% of women undergo a second operation for SUI within 10 years. The James Lind Alliance, a group of healthcare professionals and patients, identified this topic as a top 10 research priority in urinary incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par61">This study ‘Proper Understanding of Recurrent Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment in women’ (PURSUIT) is designed to help patients and doctors work out how to treat this common problem. It aims to establish whether surgical treatment is superior to endoscopic injections in terms of symptom severity at 1 year after randomisation in women with recurrent SUI. Study participants will be randomised between surgical and endoscopic interventions and the study is powered to ascertain clinically meaningful differences in symptom outcomes at 1 year after randomisation. The PURSUIT study addresses the research question “What is the best treatment for women with recurrent SUI after failed primary surgery?”.</p>
                <p id="Par62">Options to treat women with failed primary continence surgery used in the NHS include colposuspension, autologous fascial sling, AUS or endoscopic urethral bulking injections (bulking agents). MUT insertion is not currently available in the NHS.</p>
                <p id="Par63">The choice of surgical approach partly depends on the mechanism of the recurrent SUI, whether it is hypermobility or intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Colposuspension, autologous fascial sling or MUT are preferred by some surgeons for hypermobility, as these restore support for the urethra and bladder exit. Autologous fascial sling or AUS are believed to be more successful for women with recurrent SUI due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency, as they compress the urethra and thereby restore some resistance. For both mechanisms, endoscopy is a less invasive procedure than surgery. For SUI treatment with endoscopy, urethral bulking agents are injected into the urethra wall to reduce the size of the channel (also known as bladder neck injections). Examples of urethral bulking agents are Bulkamid®, Deflux® and Macroplastique®. There are a few substances marketed for urethral bulking, and a Cochrane review states that no clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This review also suggested greater symptomatic improvement was observed with surgical treatments but set against likely higher risks.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par64">The primary objective of this study is to identify whether surgical treatment achieves a superior symptomatic outcome compared to endoscopic bulking injection(s) treatment at 1 year after randomisation in 250 women with recurrent SUI.</p>
                <p id="Par65">The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the longer-term (2 and 3 years after randomisation) clinical impact of the interventions on continence, the improvement of symptoms post-intervention, procedure/operative measures, sexual function, the safety of each intervention and the likelihood of re-treatment, the cost-effectiveness from both National Health Service (NHS) and societal perspectives at 1 year after randomisation and from a secondary care NHS perspective at 3 years after randomisation, women’s experiences of interventions and associated quality of life (QoL) and clinician’s views of interventions.</p>

                  <p id="Par67">Participants will be recruited over a 2-year period and followed up for 3 years. The recruitment period incorporates an internal 6-month pilot phase to test that our assumptions about recruitment and delivery of the interventions are achievable. At least four sites will recruit during the pilot phase. Recruitment projections have been developed allowing for the staggered opening of sites, start up and seasonal effects. Based on the projections, it is expected that 24 women will be recruited by the end of the pilot phase. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable disruptions to the planned study timeline; therefore, timelines will be reviewed regularly by the Trial Management Group (TMG) and Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and discussed with the funder if adjustments are needed.</p>

                    <p id="Par68">The PURSUIT trial will employ an integrated QuinteT Recruitment Intervention aimed at optimising recruitment and informed consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recruitment challenges may arise in relation to identifying potentially eligible women, differences in levels of equipoise amongst clinicians and women’s preferences for surgery or endoscopy. There may also be organisational challenges in relation to how the treatments are operationalised within the trial context and with the integration of the trial into existing clinical practice across sites. The QRI is aimed at identifying and addressing such recruitment difficulties promptly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In PURSUIT, the QRI will be carried out intensively in the internal pilot phase with lessons learnt used to sustain recruitment during the transition to the main trial phase, similar to other surgical trials where this has been successfully implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                    <p id="Par69">The QRI uses novel qualitative and mixed-method approaches pioneered during the NIHR HTA-funded ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) study, later refined and applied to several other Randomised Control Trials (RCTs), leading to insights about recruitment issues and the development of recruitment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

                  <p id="Par96">Previous assessment results of women attending urology/urogynaecology clinics will be reviewed to determine eligibility. Patient notes and urodynamic unit clinical reports for women with previous midurethral tape/colposuspension/autologous sling/bulking injections referred for recurrent or persistent stress urinary incontinence will be assessed at sites by the clinical research team.</p>
                  <p id="Par97">When a woman presents with symptoms suggestive of recurrent SUI, diagnostic testing to confirm urodynamic stress incontinence using standard approaches according to NICE will be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This testing will be done as part of their routine NHS clinical care. If a woman’s previous SUI surgery was midurethral tape, it will be considered whether it is possible that she might have a tape exposure (for example by physical examination, and consideration of whether cystoscopy is appropriate). If SUI is confirmed and there is no perceived risk of midurethral tape exposure being present, then the patient will be invited to participate.</p>
                  <p id="Par98">Sites may also recognise other opportunities and methods for identifying potentially eligible women which should be utilised to minimise disruption to routine practice and involvement for the patient (e.g. during a routine clinical appointment/physiotherapy appointment/urodynamic assessment/multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings).</p>
                  <p id="Par99">Staff at all sites are asked to complete a trial-specific screening log for all potentially eligible women and provide confirmation of the patient’s outcome for the study; this will be one of three main outcomes: (1) patient confirmed as ineligible, (2) patient was eligible but declined to take part and (3) patient was eligible and consented to take part. Where possible, screening logs will include reason(s) for non-participation to ensure that participants are not approached more than once and to highlight patients who are willing to be contacted in the future if they were not able to participate when first approached (e.g. due to an acute intercurrent illness at that time). Sites will provide the central trial team (at the University of Bristol (UOB)) with a copy of their screening logs on a monthly basis, for monitoring purposes.</p>

If the patient is eligible and would like to take part, written informed consent will be obtained. If the patient is identified during a clinical appointment, informed consent may be taken during that appointment (i.e. before the patient has had 24 h to consider the study), but site staff must follow up with the patient after 24 h has passed to ensure they are happy to continue <italic>before</italic> they are randomised.</p>

                <p id="Par118">Early feedback from our Patient Advisory Group (PAG) and women affected by recurrent SUI was pivotal in establishing the design of the PURSUIT study. It was clear from discussions between patients and the clinical applicants that randomising women to specific surgical procedures was not an acceptable approach, an opinion echoed subsequently by the Research Ethics Committee (REC) during their review of the study. Each surgical operation has different implications and consequences and the impact on patients is highly individual. Furthermore, the surgery chosen should be appropriate for treating the underlying mechanism of the SUI identified in each individual woman (urethral hypermobility or intrinsic sphincter deficiency). It was concluded that endoscopic bulking injections could appropriately be compared against the other interventions (the surgical procedures).</p>
                <p id="Par119">Accordingly, the design of PURSUIT was determined following this important feedback. Women with confirmed recurrent SUI will be randomised to one of two treatment arms: endoscopic (bulking injections) or a surgical treatment.</p>

                  <p id="Par120">After women with a history of recurrent SUI have been identified, standard assessments as per NICE NG123 guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] will be undertaken, including urodynamic testing, to confirm diagnosis. These assessments will also help to ascertain what type of surgery would be suitable for the patient, should she be randomised to the “surgical” treatment arm. Following these assessments, the patient is then randomised (allocated) to either the endoscopic (bulking injections) or the surgical treatment arm and will receive their intervention according to usual local practice.</p>

                  <p id="Par121">The type of surgical intervention received by participants who are randomised to the surgical treatment arm will be decided following a detailed discussion between the patient and their surgeon (clinician), as per usual local practice. The PURSUIT study will not impose a specific surgical procedure upon patients. Surgery options available for recurrent SUI are autologous fascial sling, colposuspension and AUS. Currently, there are specific rules from the NHS which regulate the use of mesh in vaginal surgery, including midurethral tapes. The rules relevant at the time will be used for anyone wishing to consider this type of surgery.</p>

Examples of urethral bulking agents are Bulkamid®, Deflux® and Macroplastique®. The PURSUIT trial does not impose which urethral bulking agent(s) should be used; sites should use their usual urethral bulking agent(s). In the endoscopic arm, repeat injections are permitted.</p>

                <p id="Par123">Participants can choose to withdraw for any reason, at any time, during their involvement in the trial. Participants can withdraw from complying with the allocated trial treatment or providing data to the trial without affecting their usual care. In both cases, efforts will be made to report the reason for withdrawal as thoroughly as possible in a study-specific form. If a participant wishes to withdraw from receiving the allocated trial treatment, efforts will be made to continue to obtain follow-up data, with the permission of the patient or family as appropriate (including access to medical notes/databases). In the event the clinician feels it is unsafe for the participant to continue in the study, he/she can withdraw the participant from the study.</p>
                <p id="Par124">If a delay has occurred between confirmation of eligibility and the delivery of the allocated intervention, site staff will ensure eligibility is still valid before proceeding. If the participant is no longer eligible, for example due to a change in symptoms, they would be withdrawn from the study.</p>
                <p id="Par125">There should be no cross-over of patients from their randomised treatment allocation to the alternative treatment until after the primary outcome is recorded (1 year post randomisation). However, this is guidance only and cannot be imposed.</p>

                <p id="Par140">To inform our calculations we reviewed the literature using the ICIQ-UI-SF. A recent study of women with SUI suggested that the minimum clinically important difference was −5 when using anchor-based methods, and −2 with distribution-based methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We felt that the conservative estimate of −2 (equivalent to a difference of 0.5 standard deviation (SD)) was an important difference. To allow for the possibility that 5% of women randomised to surgery instead receive endoscopic treatment before 1 year, we reduced difference to detect to −1.9. Thus we estimate that we need to recruit 250 women (125 in each treatment arm) to detect a difference in mean ICIQ-UI-SF at 1 year of 1.9 (assuming common SD of 4.1; in line with the assumptions made in the study by Sirls et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) with 90% power and a significance level of 5%.

If delivery of study interventions is paused, or there are considerable delays, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients may provide informed consent to take part, but randomisation and baseline data collection will not be undertaken until treatment interventions can proceed. As soon as treatment interventions can proceed, site staff will ensure eligibility and consent are still applicable and valid before conducting randomisation and collecting baseline data. Previous urodynamic results (used for initial confirmation of study eligibility) can be used providing that the doctor considers that they are still relevant, i.e. the tests were conducted since the woman’s last procedure and her symptoms have not changed since then.</p>

                  <p id="Par146">A local research nurse or trained delegate (or member of the central trial team) will randomise patients using the online or telephone randomisation system. Randomisation will only be done after eligibility has been confirmed, written consent obtained and the patient has had at least 24 h to consider the study information and had any questions answered. Randomisation can be conducted during a face-to-face consultation (clinical appointment or study-specific visit) or be completed remotely. Site staff will inform participants of their treatment allocation during or after the consultation. Once a participant has been randomised, they are ‘enrolled’ in the study, they will be added to the appropriate procedure waiting list (as per usual local clinical practice) and treatment (intervention delivery) can proceed. Site staff will notify the participant’s General Practitioner (GP) that their patient has entered the trial.</p>

Site-specific feedback may cover institutional barriers, while multi-site group feedback sessions may address widespread challenges that would benefit from discussion. All group feedback sessions will be aided by displaying anonymised data extracts from interviews and audio-recorded consultations. Individual confidential feedback will also be offered, particularly where recruiters experience specific difficulties, or where there is a need to discuss potentially sensitive issues. Investigator meetings/teleconferences and site visits from the CI/TMG members may also be employed to discuss technical or clinical challenges (e.g. discomfort surrounding eligibility criteria).</p>

In the case of a missing questionnaire, the response to the questionnaire can be collected from the participant over the telephone to reduce loss to follow-up. Multiple options are available to participants for them to complete their questionnaires, this ensures that the questionnaires are easily accessible to everyone (post/online/telephone). Other methods to promote participant retention will include obtaining back-up ‘best contact’ addresses, contacting the participant’s GP practice to check their contact details on record are still valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and using ‘thank you’ vouchers as retention incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

REDCap is a secure, web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system designed for the collection of research data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The system has been developed and supported by Vanderbilt University. BTC has set up its own infrastructure so that all systems are hosted at, and supported by, UOB. The database will be maintained on a SQL server database system within the UOB and will only be accessible to members of the research team. Any data stored on laptops will be encrypted. Any information that is analysed or transferred outside the UK will be anonymised. Participants will be informed via the PIL that personal information such as their name, email address and phone number will be stored on the secure database with the central trial team.</p>

A Relational Database Management System will be used to provide integration services between administrative and clinical databases. The administrative data will be kept in a secure database that is only accessible from within the UOB firewall. All users will require (at least honorary) contracts with UOB to access it. Anonymised clinical data is linked by the study participant ID to the administrative data. Email addresses are collected as they are essential for providing participant questionnaires electronically. The ‘Email Address’ field is flagged as an identifier and not included in the export for the statistician, so the data set can be considered pseudonymised at export and doesn't need further processing.</p>

Discounting for the 3-year analysis will be based on NICE recommended rates at the time, currently 3.5% for both costs and benefits. The relevant most up-to-date NHS reference costs will be used to value the information obtained from either the Hospitals’ costing systems or HES. Community-based NHS resource use, time off work and normal activities will be valued using routine data, e.g. Unit Costs of Health and Social Care; ONS Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.

                  <p id="Par247">Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated if no arm is dominant, i.e. more effective and less costly than the other arm. Incremental net monetary benefit statistics will also be produced over a range of willingness to pay thresholds for a QALY.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par296">This article outlines a definitive two-arm multicentre RCT to compare endoscopic intervention (urethral bulking injections) with surgical interventions (colposuspension, autologous fascial sling, MUT (if allowed) or AUS) in adult women with recurrent SUI. The aim is to determine whether surgical treatment is superior to endoscopic bulking injections in terms of symptom severity 1 year after randomisation.</p>

                  <title>Site capacity</title>
                  <p id="Par298">The study was open for just 10 weeks before recruitment was halted for 6 months due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Despite approval to re-start the trial in September 2020, the immense impact of the pandemic on the NHS is ongoing and will be long-lasting. The capacity of research and clinical teams to open the study and conduct trial activity over the past 2 years has been substantially reduced and some sites have had to withdraw from participation.</p>

                <sec id="Sec98">
                  <title>Low surgical prioritisation of the patient group</title>
                  <p id="Par299">During the pandemic, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) implemented a clinical guide to surgical prioritisation, classifying all procedures from P1 (priority 1—immediate treatment) to P4 (priority 4—procedures to be performed in &gt;3 months). All incontinence procedures, including those for recurrent SUI, are classified as the lowest priority (P4) as the condition is not life-threatening, but with the substantial backlog of operations, P4 currently means “delayed indefinitely”. Waiting lists for these treatments are now, at many hospitals, greater than 1 year, with some approaching 2 years. Many women with recurrent SUI have lived with symptoms, which severely affect their quality of life, for years and sometimes even decades. They have experienced an unsuccessful treatment, which can cause considerable distress and their ongoing symptoms affect their self-esteem, relationships, and their occupations. Some of these women have also undergone removal of vaginal mesh which may have caused their symptoms to deteriorate to a level worse than when they first sought treatment. Their symptoms are marginalised by this low prioritisation, which is a backward step, considering that it took years for incontinence to receive due recognition for its true impact on women. The issue is being escalated to the relevant bodies, with the aim of re-assessing and re-classifying prioritisation for this patient group.</p>

                  <title>Patient reluctance to seek further treatment</title>
                  <p id="Par300">Women with recurrent SUI are often reticent to seek further treatment because of their experience of a previously failed procedure and some women have understandably lost trust in the medical community due to the widely reported potential complications of vaginal mesh surgery. During the pandemic, PURSUIT site teams have reported that fewer women than usual are being referred to secondary care for recurrent SUI treatment. This reduction may be indicative of the impact of the pandemic on primary care capacity but could also signify an additional reluctance of women to seek help from an already over-burdened and struggling health service. Furthermore, our patient and public involvement contributors have voiced their concerns about visiting a clinical setting during the pandemic, where there could be an increased risk of COVID transmission; thus, it is likely this may also be an influencing factor.</p>

                <title>Adaptations to study design and conduct</title>
                <p id="Par301">The timelines for study delivery have been significantly disrupted; thus, the pilot phase and main recruitment phases are now being conducted concurrently. Findings from the QRI sub-study have been used to develop and roll-out a comprehensive training package for recruiting sites. The training has provided further scope to identify recruitment barriers, while supporting and optimising recruitment where possible. Every stage of study delivery has been affected by the challenges described above, and where possible, resolutions have been implemented to address these.</p>
                <sec id="Sec101">
                  <title>Identification of sites</title>
                  <p id="Par302">A number of pre-identified sites had reduced or no capacity to proceed with study set up during the pandemic. We worked with the NIHR Clinical Research Networks (CRNs) to contact hospitals across the UK asking for new expressions of interest (EOI). We were able to identify additional sites with the required clinical expertise, patient population and staff capacity.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="Sec102">
                  <title>Site set up and training</title>
                  <p id="Par303">Site initiation training for pilot sites was delivered in person (pre-pandemic). Due to travel restrictions and to ensure safety of all staff, we redesigned and implemented remote site initiation training for phase II sites. This consists of an extensive package of training materials provided electronically, followed with a live online meeting for questions and answers, to discuss site-specific plans for study implementation and to identify any potential barriers. Remote training provides more flexibility for site staff to fit study training around their clinical commitments and their increased workload. We also developed a central electronic Investigator Site File (eISF) to replace paper files. This enables efficient provision of study documentation to sites teams, reduces the workload of site staff as it is managed by the central trial team, assists with ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the files, uses fewer physical resources and is more cost-effective.</p>

                  <title>Participant recruitment</title>
                  <p id="Par304">Some NHS trusts introduced remote (telephone or video call) clinical appointments for their patients, where appropriate. Accordingly, we adapted study processes to enable patient identification and recruitment to proceed remotely, with no requirement for patients to be seen face-to-face at baseline. Site teams screen and identify potential participants (from referrals, clinic lists and during remote appointments) and provide study information to patients verbally, electronically or via post. We introduced electronic consent (eConsent), which was essential to facilitate the continuation of recruitment during the period when few face-to-face appointments and no interventions were being conducted. Site staff can randomise their participants and inform them of their allocated intervention via telephone. Through the eConsent system, participants complete their baseline questionnaire electronically during a remote appointment with recruiting staff (or verbally via telephone, if preferred).</p>

                <sec id="Sec123">
                  <title>Treatment (intervention)</title>
                  <p id="Par305">The primary outcome for PURSUIT is the patient-reported ICIQ-UI-SF at 1 year after randomisation, but the huge increase in waiting list times for procedures means that patients may reach this critical study time point before they receive their treatment. To mitigate this risk, we introduced the option of delayed randomisation. Where waiting lists for interventions are around 12 months, site staff can proceed with taking full informed consent but do not randomise or collect baseline data until interventions can proceed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="Sec104">
                  <title>Follow-up</title>
                  <p id="Par306">There is no requirement for study-specific visits to hospital for follow-up. Participant questionnaires at all follow-up time points can be completed via post, electronically or over the telephone.</p>
                  <p id="Par307">The adaptations described here do not replace the original in-person approach but are offered as alternatives to facilitate study delivery and will continue to be offered beyond the pandemic. Providing options to participants facilitates inclusivity which in turn supports recruitment and retention. Feedback regarding these changes from our patient and public involvement contributors was extremely positive and highlighted the importance of flexibility and individual preferences. Being able to participate remotely was considered to be of huge benefit to this particular patient group by reducing the burden associated with travel to hospital and reducing time away from home, work and childcare responsibilities.</p>
                  <p id="Par308">The results from this study will provide the evidence which is currently lacking on endoscopic bulking injections and surgical treatments. The findings will inform future NICE policy and guidelines, providing healthcare professionals and patients with a solid evidence base to guide shared decision making regarding further treatment, ultimately improving symptoms and quality of life for women with recurrent SUI.</p>

              <p>The Data Manager (in collaboration with the CI) will manage access rights to the data set. Prospective new users must demonstrate compliance with legal, data protection and ethical guidelines before any data are released. Anonymous research data, including QRI audio-recordings and associated data, will be stored securely on research data storage facility (RDSF) and kept for future analysis with participant consent. We anticipate that anonymised trial data will be shared with other researchers to enable international prospective meta-analyses. Requests for access to data must be via a written confidentiality and DSA available from the RDSF website which will be confirmed by the CI (or appointed nominee). The DSA should cover limitations of use, transfer to third parties, data storage and acknowledgements. The person applying for use of the data will be scrutinised for appropriate eligibility by members of the research team.</p>
