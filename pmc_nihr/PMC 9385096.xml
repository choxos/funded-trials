                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Approximately 75,000 people fracture a hip each year in the UK. This painful injury can be devastating—with a high associated mortality rate—and survivors likely to be more dependent and less mobile. Pain relief at the scene of injury is known to be inadequate. Intravenous morphine is usually given by paramedics, but opioids are less effective for dynamic pain and can cause serious side effects, including nausea, constipation, delirium and respiratory depression. These may delay surgery, require further treatment and worsen patient outcomes. We completed a feasibility study of paramedic-provided fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB), testing the intervention, trial methods and data collection. The study (RAPID) demonstrated that a full trial was feasible. In this subsequent study, we aim to test safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness of paramedic-provided FICB as pain relief to patients with suspected hip fracture in the prehospital environment.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will conduct a pragmatic multi-centre individually randomised parallel-group trial, with a 1:1 allocation between usual care (control) and FICB (intervention). Hospital clinicians in five sites (paired ambulance services and receiving hospitals) in England and Wales will train 220 paramedics to administer FICB. The primary outcome is change in pain score from pre-randomisation to arrival at the emergency department. One thousand four hundred patients are required to find a clinically important difference between trial arms in the primary outcome (standardised statistical effect ~ 0.2; 90% power, 5% significance). We will use NHS Digital (England) and the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) databank (Wales) to follow up patient outcomes using routine anonymised linked data in an efficient study design, and questionnaires to capture patient-reported outcomes at 1 and 4 months. Secondary outcomes include mortality, length of hospital stay, job cycle time, prehospital medications including morphine, presence of hip fracture, satisfaction, mobility, and NHS costs. We will assess safety by monitoring serious adverse events (SAEs).</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The trial will help to determine whether paramedic administered FICB is a safe, clinically and cost-effective treatment for suspected hip fracture in the pre-hospital setting. Impact will be shown if and when clinical guidelines either recommend or reject the use of FICB in routine practice in this context.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par34">Hip fractures are very common—approximately 70,000 people suffer one each year in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A hip fracture can be devastating for a patient—there is a high associated short-term mortality, and those who survive are likely to be more dependent and less mobile than before their injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. At present, a hip fracture is the most common cause of admission to an orthopaedic ward with an average length of stay of 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients with hip fracture occupy 2.5% of all hospital beds at any time and cost the National Health Service (NHS) £2 billion each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As the average age of the population rises, the annual incidence and cost of hip fractures will also increase. Improving the care of patients with hip fracture is therefore of increasing importance.</p>
                <p id="Par35">When a patient fractures their hip, both the event itself and its aftermath are very painful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Untreated pain will increase the neuro-hormonal stress response and the risk of delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but the literature suggests adequate pain relief is often not achieved for patients with hip fracture in the prehospital environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">Intravenous (IV) opioids (usually morphine) are most commonly given to patients by paramedics at the scene of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but are relatively ineffective for dynamic pain (on movement), which patients commonly experience during transfer to hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">Importantly, opiates can cause numerous serious side effects, including nausea, constipation, delirium and respiratory depression. These may delay surgery, require further treatment and worsen patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Long-term outcomes of patients with hip fracture may improve if they did not receive opioids in prehospital care. If the paramedic who attends the patient is able to administer an alternative form of analgesia, the patient may not require morphine and thus not be exposed to opiate side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For instance, if a patient who has received morphine experiences respiratory depression, they may require naloxone and be more likely to suffer from respiratory infections. Alternatively, if morphine causes the patient to be acutely confused, their surgery may be delayed beyond the recommended 48 h in which it is known to improve outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Such events lead to increased costs to the NHS, both directly from treatment required to alleviate the side effect, and from the increased length of hospital stay. Providing alternative, effective, non-opioid pain relief to patients with hip fracture in prehospital care may reduce side effects and improve patient outcomes including length of hospital stay (as found in an in-hospital study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). This would be beneficial for both patients and the NHS.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB)—a local anaesthetic injection directly into the hip region—is routinely used by medical, and increasingly, nurse practitioners in the Emergency Department (ED) and on orthopaedic wards for pain relief. Although this procedure may provide effective analgesia as well as allow the reduction of morphine administration, it is not known whether it improves patient outcomes or is cost-effective in the prehospital setting.</p>
                <p id="Par39">FICB is a suitable alternative to opiate medication; it is a regional anaesthetic technique which delivers local anaesthetic directly to the hip region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In-hospital studies have shown that FICB provides effective pain relief for hip fracture with minimal side effects (fewer than morphine) and is inexpensive to provide, and the technique is easy to learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland support its delivery by non-medically trained health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. So far, three small studies have been conducted, all demonstrating the viability of delivery of FICB by non-medics in prehospital care: one by nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and two by paramedics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. One of these was a single-site feasibility study, RAPID, conducted by this study team, to ensure that this multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be viable and worthwhile conducting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>

                <title>Paramedic training</title>
                <p id="Par56">Paramedics will need to successfully complete training to administer the FICB. Letters of access will be arranged for paramedics to conduct training on hospital grounds. We will follow methods used in the RAPID feasibility trial, with additions prompted by qualitative work with paramedics in that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We therefore add ‘scenario training’ to group sessions, familiarisation with the trial packs and methods and refresher training midway through the recruitment period in order to prevent skill decay.</p>
                <p id="Par57">The three elements to the initial paramedic training are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par58">1) Online e-learning, covering administration of FICB and Good Clinical Practice training.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par59">2) Group ‘classroom’ sessions, led by a consultant anaesthetist and covering hip fracture recognition, anatomy, pharmacology, FICB procedure and equipment, toxicity recognition and treatment, pre-hospital scenarios and trial processes. Life-sized groin models, custom made for training paramedics in the study, will be used to simulate administering FICB. A study site researcher will cover trial methods, including trial eligibility criteria, the importance of recording pain scores and the use of scratchcards and randomisation log. In the context of COVID, these training sessions may take place online.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par60">3) In-hospital training. Pairs of paramedics will attend sessions at the receiving hospital where they will administer FICB to real patients, supervised by an anaesthetist or emergency medicine doctor. They will alternate between administering and critiquing the FICB to ensure their learning is active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The paramedics must administer three FICBs competently and critique three FICBs performed by their peers, before being allowed to recruit patients to the study. The FICB and Intralipid (antidote for local anaesthetic toxicity) packs will be available for paramedics to familiarise themselves with. The anaesthetists providing training will run through prehospital scenarios with the paramedics, including assessing eligibility and taking consent. We will provide written material and assessments to optimise learning in between block performances. These will include research and clinical questions, e.g. patient trial eligibility, contraindications to FICB, information to give when taking consent for FICB including risks and how long the FICB will take to work.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par61">We will make training documents available in an online area accessible to the training paramedics. Formal refresher training will be available to paramedics who have not performed FICB for more than 3 months.</p>
                <p id="Par62">Information sheets will be provided to all untrained operational staff (paramedics, advanced paramedic practitioners and emergency medical technicians) in the participating areas of ambulance services so that front line staff are aware of the trial and have an acceptable understanding of it.</p>

                <p id="Par63">In this RCT in the emergency prehospital setting, we do not propose to attempt to consent patients to participate in research at the time of their injury, as they are likely to be in significant pain. We believe that truly informed consent to research cannot be gained in this highly emotional and distressing situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Paramedics will consent patients to treatment only, and an NHS researcher will approach the patient or consultee for consent to follow up through research questionnaires as soon as possible following the 999 call (and within 10 days).</p>

We do not propose to exclude these patients from the trial, as the evidence we gather in this group may contribute to improving their care and outcomes. In these circumstances, we will seek consent from a consultee (which could be the patients’ relative, friend or carer).

                    <p id="Par66">Currently, when a patient who has called 999 is attended by a paramedic for a suspected hip fracture, the paramedic clinically assesses the patient, takes their history, examines them and records observations (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, Glasgow Coma Scale, patient-reported pain score and temperature). Paramedics cannulate patients and provide IV fluids and/or oxygen, as appropriate, based on clinical parameters. They are currently able to provide systemic analgesia only, most commonly opioids (IV morphine), paracetamol and Entonox. In RAPID2, patients allocated to usual care will receive this care.</p>

                <p id="Par113">The RAPID feasibility study used an 11-point pain scale (0 being no pain, 10 the worst pain imaginable), and reported an average reduction of approximately 4 points in pain score (standard deviation 2.7 points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These data consistent with that reported elsewhere in broadly similar settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our patient and public contributors and clinicians judged an average difference in change of 0.5 ~ 0.6 points to be clinically important. The mid-point of this range in average differences in change corresponds to a standardised statistical effect of ~ 0.2 between control and intervention arms; for 90% power at the 5% significance level. We therefore need approximately 1000 analysable outcomes. If approximately 20% of patients lack pain scores, 10% of participants dissent from anonymised follow-up of routine records, and we are unable to match 1% of cases in Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) and NHS Digital, then we will need to allocate randomly and equally 1404 patients to study arms.</p>
                <p id="Par114">The rate of recruitment of 5 patients randomised per paramedic per year observed in our feasibility study will be reduced by the addition of an exclusion criterion (the use of anticoagulants). Our data indicate that the reduction is likely to be ~ 30%. With this reduction, we have calculated that we will need five hospital sites with approximately 40 trained paramedics recruiting an average of seven patients in 24 months. Each site will be expected to recruit approximately 280 patients in this time, although there may be slightly different recruitment rates between sites due to the different demographics and sizes of catchment areas of receiving hospitals.</p>

We are particularly interested in adverse events which may be due to the FICB being performed in the prehospital environment, for example, an increased incidence of infection at the injection site. The researcher will also collect information about any complications of the FICB from the medical notes and how long the patient waited to be taken to theatre for surgical fixation from the hospital’s theatre system.

                  <p id="Par139">The primary analysis will be by ‘treatment allocated’, adjusting for explanatory factors and covariates including patient age and gender, patterns of presentation (e.g., whether out-of-hours or not) and previous hip fractures. Generalised multilevel mixed linear models will accommodate clustering effects for paramedics and study sites, with numbers of levels in models determined using statistically significant changes in likelihood ratio tests according to the principle of parsimonious parameterisation. Residual diagnostics will be used where analyses assume normality; if the distributions of residuals are markedly non-normal (e.g. marked skewness in the primary pain outcome), data transformation techniques or bootstrapping will be considered. Residual analysis will also be used to identify outliers; identified outliers will be excluded before repeating the analysis.</p>

The cost per patient treated will be determined by dividing the training cost by the likely number of eligible patients seen by each ambulance unit trained. Training is a capital investment with a 5-year life expectancy and, as such, the cost will be annuitised (using 3.5% discount rate) to determine the cost per year.</p>

                    </title>
                    <p id="Par142">We will conduct two main analyses of incremental cost-effectiveness to estimate the incremental cost per unit change in pain score from that recorded pre-randomisation to that recorded on arrival in ED. Compared to hospital setting (both ED and ward), pain is relatively rarely used as a primary outcome measure in the pre-hospital setting. This large multi-centre study will offer some useful insights into its use as an outcome measure in this setting. We again use mixed linear models to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratios and employ non-parametric bootstrap estimates (bias corrected) to confirm 95% confidence intervals. A cost-effectiveness plane will present the probability that the intervention is dominant or cost-effective. If FICB is more effective but also more expensive, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) will show the probability of effectiveness against different thresholds of willingness to pay for pain reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
                    <p>The incremental cost utility analysis will assess the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the new model of care. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a measure of health benefits and the use of the generic preference-based HRQoL measure EQ-5D-5L to determine health status. HRQoL appears to be sensitive to change and appropriate for use in orthopaedic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Again, mixed linear models will be used to estimate the cost utility ratios and bias-corrected non-parametric bootstrap is used to confirm 95% confidence intervals around the point estimate. We will use baseline EQ-5D-5L scores as a covariate in the estimation of QALYs.</p>
                    <p>A series of sensitivity analyses, involving NHS cost drivers and training formats, will assess the robustness of both incremental cost-effectiveness analyses.</p>

                    <p id="Par145">In this analysis costs are set against the whole range of outcomes (primary and secondary). This framework of analysis is now recognised as a useful alternative by NICE when carrying out economic evaluation with multiple important outcomes, interventions that have multiple effects which are difficult to summarise in a common unit such as public health intervention (NICE 2013) and the preferred framework for the economic evaluation of public health interventions. Because cost and consequences analyses are not restricted to a single outcome measure, the use of this framework will enable us to focus the attention of policy makers to the set of secondary outcomes we are measuring in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>
                    <p>We will formalise and agree with trial management and oversight committees in advance of any analysis, all planned analyses in a combined Statistics and Health Economics Analysis Plan (SHEAP), compliant with relevant Swansea Trials Unit Standard Operating Procedures. The SHEAP will provide full details on model fitting conventions, such as inclusion and exclusion rules for covariates and factors, management of missing data, and the reporting of outcomes. In summary: potential factors and covariates to be included in models will be tested; those with an F value of less than 1 (that is, they increase the standard error of the estimate) will be excluded and the analysis recalculated. Binary covariates where almost all cases (&gt; 90%) are in one category will also be excluded. Wherever possible, outcome descriptions, summaries and comparisons will be reported using appropriate CONSORT guidelines, including estimates with 95% confidence intervals (allowing two-tailed tests at the 5% significance level).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par165">The training planned in this RCT has been affected by Covid-19 in a number of ways. Early in the trial, before recruitment began, one ambulance service withdrew, as they felt their paramedics were fatigued from Covid-19 and did not want to give them additional work. Training has been delayed by Covid-19 for two main reasons: lack of elective hip replacement lists and reduced access to hospitals. Finally, Covid-19 has meant that we needed to modify the scratchcard design slightly so that they could be used wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE)—we are now including a ‘scratcher’ with the scratchcards.</p>
              <p id="Par166">In addition to Covid-19 delays, some hospitals have moved away from using landmark guidance to perform FICB, in preference of ultrasound. This is not something that can be done in the prehospital environment, so we could not conduct training in these hospitals.</p>
