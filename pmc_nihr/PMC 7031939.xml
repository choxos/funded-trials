                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Patientsâ€™ pre-operative health and physical function is known to influence their post-operative outcomes. In patients with knee osteoarthritis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological options are often not optimised prior to joint replacement. This results in some patients undergoing surgery when they are not as fit as they could be. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a pre-operative package of non-operative care versus standard care prior to joint replacement.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a multicentre, randomised controlled feasibility trial of patients undergoing primary total knee replacement for osteoarthritis. Sixty patients will be recruited and randomised (2:1) to intervention or standard care arms. Data will be collected at baseline (before the start of the intervention), around the end of the intervention period and a minimum of 90â€‰days after the planned date of surgery. Adherence will be reviewed each week during the intervention period (by telephone or in person). Participants will be randomised to a pre-operative package of non-operative care or standard care. The non-operative care will consist of (1) a weight-loss programme, (2) a set of exercises, (3) provision of advice on analgesia use and (4) provision of insoles. The intervention will be started as soon as possible after patients have been added to the waiting list for joint replacement surgery to take advantage of the incentive for behavioural change that this will create. The primary outcomes of this study are feasibility outcomes which will indicate whether the intervention and study protocol is feasible and acceptable and whether a full-scale effectiveness trial is warranted.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The following will be measured and used to inform study feasibility: rate of recruitment, rate of retention at 90-day follow-up review after planned surgery date, and adherence to the intervention estimated through review questionnaires and weight change (for those receiving the weight-loss aspect of intervention). In addition the following information will be assessed qualitatively: analysis of qualitative interviews exploring acceptability, feasibility, adherence and possible barriers to implementing the intervention, and acceptability of the different outcome measures.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The aims of the study specifically relate to testing the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed effectiveness trial intervention and the feasibility of the trial methods.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">This study forms the important first step in developing and assessing whether the intervention has the potential to be assessed in a future fully powered effectiveness trial. The findings will also be used to refine the design of the effectiveness trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par33">The lifetime risk of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is 45% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. OA is the fastest growing cause of disability worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and predicted to be the fourth leading cause of disability by 2020. Non-operative treatments, such as exercise, orthoses, analgesics and weight loss, are known to benefit patients with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients with more severe OA are referred to secondary care for consideration of joint replacement surgery. Around 85,000 total knee arthroplasties (TKA) are performed annually in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Dissatisfaction with outcome is reported in around 20% of these cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">Patientsâ€™ pre-operative health and physical function is known to influence their post-operative outcomes. In patients with knee OA, pharmacological and non-pharmacological options are often not optimised prior to joint replacement. This results in some patients undergoing surgery when they are not as fit as they could be.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The overall aim of this project is to develop a complex intervention and an implementable package of care for patients listed for total knee replacement with the aims of improving post-operative outcomes and reducing complication risks. The aims of the study specifically relate to testing the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed effectiveness trial intervention and the feasibility of the trial methods.</p>
              <p id="Par36">This study aims to take advantage of the incentive for behavioural change in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who have been placed on the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery, to obtain a durable alteration in the patientsâ€™ weight and exercise level. Non-operative treatments, such as exercise, orthoses, analgesics and weight loss, are known to benefit patients with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] but are often not optimised prior to joint replacement. We postulate that the reduction in weight and increased activity coupled with an appropriate analgesia review and attention to footwear in the pre-operative window will result in a sustained improvement in the patientâ€™s health-related quality of life following knee replacement.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Exercise</title>
                <p id="Par37">The amount of exercise that osteoarthritic patients attending orthopaedic clinics carry out is very variable, yet there is good evidence that exercise (such as walking, swimming and cycling) reduces pain and improves physical function in patients with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The patients in this study are at the stage of listing for knee replacement and for them (unlike the early OA group for whom OARSI guidelines have been developed) the most efficacious exercise is muscle strengthening as this can enhance functional ability such as climbing stairs.</p>

                <p id="Par38">Shoes which have a thick shock-absorbing sole are considered most suitable for patients with lower-limb OA. In particular, there is evidence that in patients with knee OA, the use of shoes with shock-absorbing insoles for 1â€‰month reduces pain and improves physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>

                <title>Analgesics</title>
                <p id="Par39">Many patients are not keen on taking strong painkillers, and compliance with OA pharmacological treatment is around 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, for mild to moderate pain, paracetamol can be effective. In addition, there is evidence that topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help relieve pain in knee and hand OA, yet many patients have not tried a range of simple analgesics.</p>

                <title>Weight loss</title>
                <p id="Par40">Obesity and being overweight are known to impair mobility and activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patients frequently have not lost weight prior to being listed for surgery and often have actually gained weight. There is evidence that for those who have knee OA being overweight can make symptoms worse for those who have knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par41">In primary care, the effectiveness for patients with knee OA of weight-loss regimens on body weight, pain and/or physical function has been demonstrated in programmes delivered as weekly supervised sessions for a range of 8â€‰weeks to 2â€‰years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In secondary care, in a study in New Zealand, where the waiting list times typically exceed 1â€‰year, patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of over 40 were seen by a dietician. Surgery was withheld until the BMI was less than 40. Fifty-eight percent of patients lost weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A further study carried out in Denmark on osteoarthritic patients has demonstrated that a significant weight loss can occur in 8â€‰weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and that a greater initial weight loss improves long-term maintenance of the reduction in weight.</p>
                <sec id="Sec6">
                  <title>Behavioural change</title>
                  <p id="Par42">The package of care has a behavioural component which draws on Social Cognitive Theory, the Health Belief Model and Control Theory. It incorporates a number of evidence-based behaviour-change strategies to help people to change their behaviour initially and maintain this in the longer term, particularly in relation to the four elements of the intervention; adherence to medication, use of insoles, diet and physical activity. The key behaviour-change strategies include goal-setting, planning, self-monitoring and dealing with relapse. The intervention will also address key motivational aspects. Behavioural changes are often difficult to achieve in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, a recent cluster-randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] has demonstrated that smoking-cessation therapy given during a hospital in-patient episode had a much higher success rate suggesting that capitalising on the secondary-care episode could be an ideal time to change patientsâ€™ behaviour; especially if it is linked to the impending surgery.</p>
                  <p id="Par43">The aim of the current research is to take advantage of this incentive for behaviour change in patients with OA attending orthopaedic clinics so that there is a durable change in the patientsâ€™ weight and exercise level, which, coupled with appropriate analgesia and insoles, could relieve the morbidity of their OA and improve outcomes following surgery. Recent evidence suggests that behaviour-change interventions may improve patient compliance with these non-surgical interventions and thus their success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. By optimising the non-operative treatment prior to surgery it may be possible to improve outcomes, such as knee pain and function, following surgery, reduce post-operative complications and at the same time improve the health-related quality of life of the patients.</p>
                  <p id="Par44">Even though the proposed package of care of non-surgical interventions is recommended for this population, the delivery of, and adherence to, these interventions is variable. As recommended by the Medical Research Council guidance on the development and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we aim to carry out a feasibility study collecting both quantitative and qualitative data prior to embarking on a fully powered effectiveness randomised controlled trial (RCT). This study forms the important first step in developing and assessing whether the intervention has the potential to be assessed in a future fully powered effectiveness trial. The findings will also be used to refine the design of the effectiveness trial.</p>

              <p id="Par71">We aim to recruit 60 participants (split between Edinburgh and Leeds sites). Recruitment is planned to take place over a 6-month period with a follow-up conducted for a minimum of 90â€‰days after the planned surgery date.</p>
              <p id="Par72">Patients recently added to the waiting list for knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis will be approached about the study by a member of the clinical team at the outpatient clinic visit where the decision to proceed to knee surgery has taken place.</p>
              <p id="Par73">All participants will be seen for a baseline visit, where they will be randomised. Depending on the result of randomisation, patients will be asked to follow standard care or the intervention until their planned date of surgery (duration of intervention will depend on when knee surgery is due to take place). All participants will be seen in clinic at the end of the intervention period for a final review (pre-surgery) and a minimum of 90â€‰days after the planned date of surgery. Participants in the intervention arm will also be reviewed regularly for the duration of the intervention to assess adherence.</p>

                <p id="Par133">Recruitment will be from the outpatient clinic where the decision to proceed to total knee replacement is made. A member of the clinical team will highlight the trial to the patient and, if interested in hearing more, the patient will be invited to complete a â€˜Consent to Researcher Contactâ€™ form and be provided with a patient information sheet. If it is known that a patient has type-2 diabetes and/or hypertension and appears to be eligible for the weight-loss aspect of the intervention, the â€˜GP consentâ€™ section of this form should also be completed (this will allow the research team to contact the patientâ€™s GP in advance of randomisation to obtain consent regarding potential medication changes should the patient be randomised to the intervention arm). The patient will be given sufficient time to consider the study information, typically at least 24â€‰h; however, contact may be made before this with the agreement of the patient. A member of the research team will discuss the study further with the patient and assess patient eligibility. Posters will also be placed in orthopaedic outpatient clinic areas for patients to highlight the study to site staff. Consent for the research team to contact the patient regarding the study may also be documented in a clinic letter from the consultant.</p>
                <p id="Par134">All staff delivering the intervention at sites will be invited to take part in an interview. A selection of staff involved in the care of individuals being seen at the outpatient clinic (including, but not limited to, orthopaedic surgeons doing knee replacement surgery, outpatient clinical staff dealing with knee replacement patients, managers involved in care delivery) at the centres taking part in the study will be invited to take part in an interview. These staff will be approached by members of the research team and provided with an information sheet and invited to complete a Consent to Contact Form. A sampling frame will be used which will include ensuring spread across the Leeds and Edinburgh sites and a range of relevant specialties and job roles.</p>

                <p id="Par174">Relevant intervention components (including the behavioural component) will be delivered in person every 2 weeks (Â±â€‰3â€‰days) by a member of the local research team and a review assessing the participantsâ€™ general health and adherence to the intervention will be completed. Participants will be asked to complete a pain questionnaire. These visits will occur approximately every 2â€‰weeks (starting on week 2) after initiating the intervention until the end of the intervention period. After the end of the TDR phase for participants on the weight-loss programme or after 8â€“12â€‰weeks for participants receiving the other aspects of the intervention (depending on the time available before surgery), participants will be encouraged to come to clinic to complete these reviews; however, they may be conducted by telephone if preferred.</p>
                <p id="Par175">At these clinic reviews, weight will be collected from those participants receiving the weight-loss aspect of the intervention. Blood pressure measurements will be collected from all participants. Participants with diabetes who are receiving the weight-loss aspect of the intervention will have blood glucose levels checked at these visits.</p>
                <p id="Par176">For participants with diabetes and/or hypertension, the week-1 review telephone call will be a clinic visit in order to measure blood pressure and blood glucose levels.</p>
                <p id="Par177">A clinic review visit should be carried out at the end of the TDR phase for those participants undertaking the weight-loss programme where there is more than 1â€‰week available for food reintroduction. At this visit, advice and information on food reintroduction will be provided. The local research team will discuss the plan for food reintroduction with the participant and support will be provided around phased food reintroduction to allow the participant to return to a normal diet before surgery. A sample food reintroduction plan will be prepared as a separate document; however, for each patient the plan will be individualised based on the time available before surgery. A period of at least 1 week should be left between the end of the TDR and the date of surgery to facilitate the food reintroduction process.</p>
                <p id="Par178">Weight-loss programme participants will be asked to complete a binge-eating scale questionnaire and an eating-disorder examination questionnaire at this end of TDR and end of Food Reintroduction phases if a binge-eating disorder was identified at the baseline visit and if participants display issues with eating food while on TDR.</p>
                <p id="Par179">Depending on the time available before surgery, some patients may progress to the Weight Loss Maintenance phase. Patients who progress to this phase will be provided with appropriate advice on weight-loss maintenance and supported by the study team until their planned surgery date.</p>

                <title>Final review (all participants)</title>
                <p id="Par180">Participants will complete a final study review at the hospital 1â€‰week (Â±â€‰3â€‰days) before the planned surgery date. Patients in the control arm may have their Final Review clinic visit aligned with their pre-admission clinic visit where the pre-admission clinic visit is no more than 3â€‰weeks before surgery. All services/interventions received in the control group will be recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par181">Participants will complete a review assessing their general health and adherence to the intervention. A timed-get-up-and-go test will be performed in addition to the following questionnaires: WOMAC, OKS, EQ-5D, arthritis self-efficacy, pain self-efficacy scale, a pain questionnaire and an eating self-efficacy scale (for those participants receiving the weight-loss aspect of the intervention). Weight and blood pressure measurements will be collected from all participants. Participants who have undertaken the weight-loss aspect of the study will be asked to complete a binge-eating scale questionnaire and an eating-disorder examination questionnaire at the end of the Food Reintroduction phase if a binge-eating disorder was identified at the baseline visit and if participants display issues with eating food while on TDR. Participants with diabetes receiving the weight-loss aspect of the intervention will have blood glucose levels checked at this visit. A period of at least 1 week should be left between the end of the intervention and the date of surgery to facilitate the food reintroduction process.</p>
                <p id="Par182">Participants on the weight-loss programme will be provided with information on weight-loss maintenance if not already received.</p>
                <p id="Par183">All services/interventions received in the control group will be recorded as part of the process evaluation.</p>

                <title>Follow-up review (all participants)</title>
                <p id="Par184">A review will be completed in clinic with participants a minimum of 90â€‰days after the planned date of surgery. A timed-get-up-and-go test will be performed and participants will be asked to complete the following questionnaires: WOMAC, OKS, EQ-5D, arthritis self-efficacy, pain self-efficacy scale, a pain questionnaire and an eating self-efficacy scale (for those participants receiving the weight-loss aspect of the intervention). Weight and blood pressure measurements will be collected from all participants. Participants who have undertaken the weight-loss aspect of the study will be asked to complete a binge-eating scale questionnaire and an eating-disorder examination questionnaire if a binge-eating disorder was identified at the baseline visit and if participants display issues with eating food while on TDR. Participants with diabetes that were receiving the weight-loss aspect of the intervention will have blood glucose levels checked at this visit.</p>
                <p id="Par185">Participants will also be asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire at this time point. Data on complications experienced 90â€‰days after surgery will be collected at this visit and from the participantsâ€™ medical notes.</p>

                <title>Process evaluation</title>
                <p id="Par186">All participants (control and intervention arm) will be invited to participate in an interview at the time of consent. Participants will also be invited to provide consent to allow recording of study reviews (where the research nurse is happy to do so) which will be analysed as part of the process evaluation. Interviews will explore participantsâ€™ attitudes towards the study processes and feasibility and acceptability of the intervention as well as assessing barriers and adherence issues. Participants who refuse to take part in the interview or refuse recording of study reviews will still be eligible to take part in the main study. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 30 participants, sampled purposively across a range of ages and trial participation status (refused to participate, agreed and retained to follow-up, agreed but did not complete the intervention). Interviews with control and intervention participants will be conducted at an appropriate time before surgery or during the 90-day follow-up period. Interviews with individuals who declined participation or withdrew from the study will be conducted at an appropriate time during the trial period. All participant reviews will be audio-recorded (where consent has been provided to do so).</p>
                <p id="Par187">Health care practitioners involved in the delivery of the intervention will be invited to be interviewed as well as up to five staff at each of the sites where the intervention is being delivered. These interviews will be conducted at an appropriate time during the trial period and will be conducted face to face or by telephone according to the preference of the interviewee. The qualitative interviews will be facilitated by a qualitative researcher with input from the qualitative lead on the study (Professor Sharon Simpson).</p>

              <title>Data collection and storage</title>
              <p id="Par188">See Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for an example schedule of study assessments and time points. Trial data will be collected on paper data collection sheets and transcribed into the project database, a web-based data entry system, at site by the research team. Data will be collected in clinic or over the telephone by a member of the research team. Personal data and study data collected on paper forms will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in a secure location at the recruitment centre.</p>
              <p id="Par189">Data regarding complications following surgery (e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT), infections, etc.) will be collected from the hospital records throughout the participantsâ€™ participation in the study to rehearse the data collection methods for the effectiveness trial. Participants will also be asked about any problems during the intervention period reviews, final review (pre-surgery) and 90-day follow-up visits.</p>
              <p id="Par190">Qualitative data will be collected by audio-recording and/or on paper forms during study reviews and interviews with a subset of participants, health care practitioners involved in delivering the intervention and staff at the sites where the intervention is being delivered. Audio data will be recorded using encrypted digital recording devices (with minimum encryption standard of AES256 equivalent) and downloaded to password-protected folders on networked drives at the University of Glasgow. Recordings will then be deleted off the recording device. Data will be subsequently transcribed (a third party may be employed to transcribe the data) after which recordings will be deleted. The qualitative researcher employed to carry out the process evaluation will be responsible for the secure storage of data.</p>
              <p id="Par191">The trial database will be stored on secure servers at the University of Edinburgh. This database will have restricted, username- and password-controlled access. A Data Management Plan will be prepared that will include the following details as a minimum: CRF development and management; CRF workflow, data-entry processes and location of source data; training and user access; data quality; quality control; and database lock. Additional details regarding the management of study data may be added to the Data Management Plan where applicable. Designated staff at ECTU will follow ECTU Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to obtain missing data and resolve queries with site staff and to ensure data quality and completeness of data across sites. A Data Quality Check Plan will be prepared as a separate document.</p>

                  <title>Randomised trial (feasibility)</title>
                  <p id="Par192">This is a feasibility study and so its aim is to assess the acceptability and practicality of delivering the intervention, and to estimate parameters for a larger study. As part of the feasibility design, we plan a 6-month recruitment window to estimate the participation rate for the future effectiveness trial. In terms of sample size, the choice of 60 is appropriate to see if a meaningful recruitment rate can be achieved. This size of feasibility study has been recommended by Lancaster et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In terms of looking more formally at feasibility, a sample of 60 randomised participants would allow us to estimate proportions such as the proportion compliant with the different aspects of the intervention or the proportion completing the trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par193">As most participants (estimated to be over 80% from our pilot data) will require multiple components of the intervention, the retention outcome relates to the overall package. Retention within the trial, applicable to all 60 randomised subjects, will be estimated with a standard error (SE) of approximately 6%. Compliance with the package of care, applicable to the 40 participants randomised to the intervention group, will be estimated with a SE of approximately 8%.</p>
                  <p id="Par194">Participants will be stratified to ensure that we address the aim of testing the feasibility of recruiting people with a range of BMI values.</p>

                <title>Proposed analyses</title>
                <p id="Par196">As this is a feasibility study the quantitative data will be presented descriptively, using appropriate summary statistics with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, the results will be summarised separately for the two sites, and no formal comparisons will be made. The key outcome measure is the number of participants recruited per centre over the 6-month recruitment period, which will be supported by the preparation of a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow chart per centre showing the â€˜pipeline leakageâ€™ from potentially eligible patients listed for surgery through to eligible, consented, randomised patients.</p>
                <p id="Par197">Rates of compliance with each relevant component of the intervention will also be reported along with completion rates for all outcome measures. The feasibility trial is not powered to explore efficacy, but the outcome data will be used to estimate the standard deviation (SD) of the data for the different outcome scales (especially WOMAC), and the impact on this SD of baseline adjustment. These estimates of variability will be used to inform the sample size calculation for the effectiveness trial. There are no plans to conduct interim analyses while recruitment is on-going or before follow-up is completed.</p>
                <p id="Par198">In designing this study we have followed the MRC guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This guidance indicates that rigid progression criteria are not appropriate. In collaboration with the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) we shall develop a straightforward decision model that will identify key barriers and enablers of recruitment, retention and compliance, and use this to decide whether and how we can adapt the design to overcome any problems we encounter.</p>

                  <title>Qualitative analyses</title>
                  <p id="Par199">Qualitative data will be analysed using Braun and Clarksâ€™ approach to thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The resulting coding framework will be discussed within the team to finalise meaningful themes and sub-themes. Twenty percent of the interviews will be double coded. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion. The analyses will test the hypothesised causal pathways expressed in the logic model. This will inform the study design of any future trial by determining which elements of the intervention work well for health-behaviour change in participants, how they interact with each other and which need adjustment or further development.</p>
                  <p id="Par200">The audio-recordings of sessions will be analysed using a checklist developed as part of the process evaluation. The researchers will listen to the audio-recordings and code absence or presence of different core parts of the intervention for the purposes of checking intervention fidelity.</p>

                  <p id="Par201">Identification of key cost drivers will be done through consultations with local experts to discuss the types of NHS services expected to be major and minor drivers differences in costs in patients undertaking the intervention or standard care. This will include consultation with the lead health economist (Andrew Stoddart), working on the analysis of NHS costs of the TRIO physio trial (a trial of physiotherapy for patients with poorly performing knee transplants, CI: Hamish Simpson). This trial included a baseline self-reported NHS resource survey at 6â€‰weeks post surgery profiling service use in the preceding 3â€‰months. These results will be visually inspected to identify factors which appear to constitute most substantially to total cost figures in order to inform future survey design. Any other transferable lessons from the trial will also be documented.</p>

              <p id="Par210">We will recruit patients recently added to the waiting list for knee replacement surgery, aiming to take advantage of the incentive for behaviour change in these patients. Patients will be randomised to receive a package of care which incorporates behaviour-change strategies to help people to change their behaviour initially and maintain this in the longer term, particularly in relation to the four elements of the intervention. We postulate that a reduction in weight and increased activity coupled with an appropriate analgesia review and attention to footwear in the pre-operative window will result in a sustained improvement in the patientâ€™s health-related quality of life following knee replacement.</p>
              <p id="Par211">This study forms the important first step in developing and assessing whether the intervention has potential to be assessed in a future fully powered effectiveness trial. The findings will also be used to refine the design of the effectiveness trial.</p>
