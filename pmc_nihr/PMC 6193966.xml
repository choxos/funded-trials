                <p id="Par1">Children in developing countries are frequently exposed to the pneumococcus, but few develop invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We test the hypothesis that natural variation exists in the rapidity of IgG responses following exposure to pneumococcal polysaccharides, and that these differences are sufficiently great to affect susceptibility to and outcome of IPD. We recruited children aged 24–36 months, who had recovered from IPD, and age-matched healthy controls and vaccinated them with 1 dose of the 23-valent PPV to mimic natural exposure. We collected serum samples after vaccination and analysed the dynamics of anti-polysaccharide antibody responses to several capsular antigens. Mean IgG response times to different serotypes were 6.4–7.3 days, with standard deviations of 0.9–1.85 days, suggesting a natural range in response times of up to 7 days. Serotype 1 elicited the largest fold-rise, serotype 23F the smallest. The proportion of responses achieved by day 7 was similar in children with a history of IPD and healthy children. There was considerable natural variation in the rapidity of anti-capsular IgG responses extending over 4–7 days. There was no evidence to suggest that children who have experienced IPD respond more slowly to heterologous pneumococcal capsular antigens than do healthy children.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">It has been proposed that neutralizing serum IgG antibodies are sufficient to protect against many diseases including those caused by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Pneumococci are killed when serum containing high levels of antibodies attach to the polysaccharide, attracting and activating serum complement proteins to form C3 and C5 complexes. The antibody-complement complexes bind receptors on phagocytic cells activating them and leading them to engulf and digest the pneumococcus (opsonophagocytosis). The protective role of these circulating antibodies in pneumococcal infections has been demonstrated in studies involving both passive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and active immunization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The minimum protective serum concentrations of pneumococcal anti-capsular antibodies has been estimated using aggregate correlates of protection to be 0.20 µg/ml<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> or 0.35 µg/ml<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> depending on the ELISA method used. Recently, serotype-specific correlates of protection of 0.78–2.83 µg/ml for serotypes 1,3, 7F, 19A, 19F and 0.14–0.20 µg/ml for serotypes 6A, 6B, 18C and 23F have been defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">In contrast to the notion of an absolute level of serum IgG required for protection, other studies have shown that some individuals with ‘non-protective’ or modest baseline antibody levels were still protected against invasive pneumococcal infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, in a randomized immunogenicity study of American Indian children given a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), a child developed invasive pneumococcal disease despite adequate levels of IgG antibody (4.98 μg/ml) against the disease-causing serotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These results suggest that the absolute amount of serum antibody is not the only immunological yardstick of a protected state. Immunological memory has been suggested as a mechanism to explain sustained protection in the absence of detectable antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, given the accumulation of vaccine failures after memory-inducing vaccines, such as PCV, meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b conjugate vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, the presence of immune memory does not guarantee protection either.</p>
              <p id="Par4">A plausible explanation for disease occurring in primed individuals with existing antibody levels is that the booster response was not sufficiently rapid to prevent the invasion and bacterial multiplication that usually occurs within a few days of colonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In the race between the expansion of pneumococci in the body and the immune response of the host, a delay of 24–48 hours in the activation of B cells and their differentiation into antibody-producing cells may be clinically significant. It is therefore possible that the dynamics of a limited anti-capsular response, either in a primed or unprimed individual, might be an important factor discriminating between those who achieve control of infection and those who do not.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We carried out two studies to investigate the following related questions: (1) What is the natural variation in the speed of human IgG response following exposure to pneumococcal capsular antigens? (2) Do individuals who are susceptible to IPD respond less rapidly with IgG following antigen stimulation than normal children? For this second study we took children who had previously had IPD to represent those with demonstrated ‘susceptibility’ although we excluded an analysis of their response to the previously infecting serotype as this could confound our analysis either due to recent memory resulting in a rapid response or due to hyporesponsiveness to the homologous serotype blunting/slowing the response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The 23-valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV23) was used as the immunogen in both studies to mimic the natural infection process. We evaluated responses to 5 common serotypes found in Kilifi district: 1, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F. Serotypes 6B, 14, 19F and 23F were among the top 6 most frequently carried serotypes in children aged &lt;5 years in Kilifi district<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The incidence of serotype 1 disease was high at 26% in children aged 24–59 months in Kilifi district<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>

                  <p id="Par6">Forty children were recruited (median age 29 months; range 24–35), of whom 18 (45%) were male. Four children withdrew from the study before completing it. Before vaccination, the GMCs varied by serotype from 0.17 μg/ml, for serotype 23F, to 1.54 μg/ml, for serotype 19F. Serotype 1 elicited the greatest mean increase (9.2-fold) by day 11, serotype 19F the smallest (2.7-fold). After day 11, the anti-capsular antibody concentrations started to decline, but remained above the pre-vaccination concentration by day 28 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A negative correlation (r = −0.35 to −0.61, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0009–0.036) between antibody fold increase and pre-vaccination antibody titre was found for all serotypes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Geometric mean concentrations of antibodies to pneumococcal serotypes 1, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F, before and after immunization with polysaccharide vaccine in healthy children (<italic>n</italic> = 36).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_33735_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e369"/></fig></p>

                  <title>Dynamics of IgG antibody production</title>
                  <p id="Par7">We then measured whether there was variation in the rapidity of immune responses. Response times (defined as time to reach half of the difference between baseline and maximum concentration) were normally distributed and the means ranged from 6.4, for serotype 6B, to 7.3 days, for serotype 14 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Response times varied by serotype (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007) and subject (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005). Standard deviations were in the range 0.91–1.85 for each serotype suggesting a response time range of approximately 4–7 days. The widest dispersion of response times by subject was seen for serotype 19F (SD 1.85). The cumulative proportion of children that had reached the response threshold (half the maximum) is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. By day 5, 31% had reached this threshold for serotype 6B but for all other serotypes less then 20% of children had reached the threshold. By day 6, the proportion that had reached this threshold was 60%, 72%, 33%, 39% and 50% for serotypes 1, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F, respectively. By the 8<sup>th</sup> day all had reached the threshold for all serotypes except 19F for which the proportion was 78%; the remaining children reached the threshold by day 11. Therefore, most children mounted IgG responses 6 to 7 days after vaccination but there was considerable variation over a period of days as shown by the lower and upper tails on the curves representing fast and slow responders, respectively. We found that the gradient of the cumulative response curve was steepest around day 7, and that for most children, antibody concentrations reached peak levels 11 days after exposure to polysaccharide. Days 7 and 11 were therefore selected as the optimum sampling days for Study 2.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of response times and increases in geometric mean concentrations of IgG antibodies to 5 polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae from pre-vaccination to day 11 in young children (<italic>n</italic> = 36).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Serotype</th><th colspan="3">Distribution of response times (days)</th><th>Fold increase</th></tr><tr><th>mean</th><th>Sd</th><th>cv*</th><th>(day11/day0)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>6.89</td><td>0.91</td><td>0.13</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>6B</td><td>6.41</td><td>1.09</td><td>0.17</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>7.25</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.15</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr><td>19F</td><td>7.21</td><td>1.85</td><td>0.26</td><td>2.8</td></tr><tr><td>23F</td><td>6.83</td><td>1.11</td><td>0.16</td><td>6.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*cv, coefficient of variation.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cumulative distribution curves representing the proportion of children reaching the response threshold (half of the maximum) against time since vaccination for serotype 1, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_33735_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e523"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par12">The purpose of the study was to investigate the dynamics of the humoral response to a representative set of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> capsular polysaccharides in order to determine if there is natural variation in the speed of antibody production in the days following exposure to pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens and if this variation is associated with prior IPD, as an indicator of susceptibility to bacterial invasion. If the hypothesis were true, it would identify an immunological marker that could be used to screen for patients at particularly high risk of IPD.</p>
              <p id="Par13">This idea has been explored in a previous study in mice, where the authors found a significant difference in the dynamics of antibody response to a <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> protein between mice that survived the infection and those that died<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Consistent with the sub-acute nature of cryptococcal infection, they found that non-survivors mounted strong humoral responses during the acute phase, whereas survivors produced antibodies later, during the chronic phase of the infection.</p>
              <p id="Par14">In human subjects, a study by Sorensen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> found no differences in geometric mean antibody concentration to polysaccharide antigens between healthy adults and infection-prone adult patients when immunized with PPV23. We hypothesized that, in a comparison of the speed of antibody response after vaccine exposure to a polysaccharide antigen, children with a history of invasive pneumococcal infection would have inherently slower anti-capsular response times than healthy children and that this inherently slow response may have been a contributory factor in the development of their episode of disease.</p>
              <p id="Par15">We found that even though individuals responded with widely different dynamics following stimulation with pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens, the group of children with a history of IPD did not respond more slowly than the control group. In fact, for two out of the five serotypes, the IPD group responded more quickly than the healthy controls.</p>
              <p id="Par16">This unexpected result may have come about for a number of reasons. Firstly, the study does not include children who suffered with fatal IPD and it may be that slow responses are associated with outcome of IPD rather than with the probability of developing disease. To study IPD outcome would require a prospective cohort study where the exposure (antibody response times) was established at baseline for a population of such size as to yield a useful number of cases of IPD. Even in Kenya, IPD is an uncommon event and such a cohort would be impracticable.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Secondly, the hypothesis may be true, but only for the homologous serotype. We did not study homologous serotypes because: 1) the prior episode of IPD may have primed for a memory response giving prior IPD cases an apparent advantage over healthy controls for that serotype and 2) the prior episode of IPD may result in hyporesponsiveness to the homologous serotype, as has been shown previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We examined the broader hypothesis that children with IPD are likely to have slow responses to polysaccharide antigens in general. Again, a cohort study is the only design that could overcome this limitation, if it were practicable.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Thirdly, the association may be confounded. The vigorous antibody responses observed have clearly been shaped by prior natural exposure to pneumococcal antigens in nasopharyngeal carriage. Children who are more frequently exposed to pneumococci may be more likely to develop IPD but they are also more likely to have acquired a wide repertoire of memory responses to different serotypes.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Our results do show that most 2–3 year olds have evidence of prior exposure to these antigens and yet the study was conducted in a period before the introduction of routine immunisation with PCV (PCV10 was introduced in January 2011) and PPV23 was not in use in children at any stage. All the children studied were at least 2 years old and were living in an area with high pneumococcal carriage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The antibody responses of these vaccine-naïve children to a first dose of PPV23 were rapid, and of IgG isotype, characteristic of memory antibody responses. Pre-vaccination antibody titres were high in children from both study groups and relatively high proportions of children had already reached the putative protective threshold of ≥0.35 µg/ml, which was derived for vaccine-induced antibody, on the basis of natural exposure alone; this was especially true for serotypes 19F and 6B (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These two serotypes were also among the top 2 most frequently carried serotypes in children aged &lt;5 years in Kilifi district<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The development of serum antibodies in response to nasopharyngeal colonization has been described previously in a similar environment in Thailand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Confounding by prior exposure could have been overcome by studying younger children but, unfortunately, children &lt;2 years of age respond poorly to PPV23 since they lack the mature B lymphocytes necessary for a T-cell-antibody-mediated immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Although this is a convincing explanation in our setting, studies of response dynamics following <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> Type b vaccine were shown to be similar in children with and without significant prior HbPs antibody levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Fourthly, the differences in rapidity of response in the first few days after vaccination might have been better delineated by the characterization of IgM responses in antibody forming cells in peripheral blood, as has been used previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Finally, it may be argued that the stimulus used, PPV23, is not a sufficient mimic of natural exposure. We considered the use of PCV in this study but the observations that post-primary immune responses in young infants are considerably higher than naturally induced immune responses in older children, even in settings with high carriage, suggest that PCV is an ‘unnatural’ stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Despite these limitations and their potential impact on the measured association between response rapidity and prior IPD in <italic>Study 2</italic>, the results of <italic>Study 1</italic> do present a very plausible case for the potential role of response times in determining clinical outcomes. Following stimulus with most serotypes, adequate responses appear in a small fraction of children within 5 days and are evident in most children by the completion of 9 days; for serotype 19F this window stretches from 3.5 to 11 days. Given the rapidity of clinical development of IPD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and its rapid evolution to death – often within 24–48 hours – the variation in response times for the key mechanism of acquired immunity does suggest that host responses may be a significant determinant of outcome.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In conclusion, our results showed wide variation in the rapidity of response to pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens suggesting that there is a critical time window in which some individuals may be more prone to invasive disease than others. Although we did not find direct evidence that the response-time is associated with susceptibility to disease, such an association is methodologically challenging to demonstrate and the failure to do so within the present design provides little assurance that response-times can be ignored in the pathogenesis of IPD and the dynamics of the acquired immune response.</p>

Analysis of this first study suggested that the optimal days for observing the speed of response, if constrained to two sample points, were days 7 and 11. In Study 2 therefore, blood samples were drawn from each child before vaccination and 7 and 11 days after the vaccination. Serum was separated from the blood samples and stored at −80 °C until tested. Pre- and post-immunization sera from each individual were tested on the same ELISA plate.</p>

The total IgG response is the difference between the maximum observed antibody concentration and the starting concentration. Differences in mean response times were tested by ANOVA. In Study 2, the response was defined from individual response curves, as the rise in antibody concentration between the starting concentration (at day 0) and maximum concentrations (at day 11).
