                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Infections acquired in hospital are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants. Several small trials have suggested that supplementing the enteral diet of very preterm infants with lactoferrin, an antimicrobial protein processed from cow's milk, prevents infections and associated complications. The aim of this large randomised controlled trial was to collect data to enhance the validity and applicability of the evidence from previous trials to inform practice.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited very preterm infants born before 32 weeks' gestation in 37 UK hospitals and younger than 72 h at randomisation. Exclusion criteria were presence of a severe congenital anomaly, anticipated enteral fasting for longer than 14 days, or no realistic prospect of survival. Eligible infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either enteral bovine lactoferrin (150 mg/kg per day; maximum 300 mg/day; lactoferrin group) or sucrose (same dose; control group) once daily until 34 weeks' postmenstrual age. Web-based randomisation minimised for recruitment site, gestation (completed weeks), sex, and single versus multifetal pregnancy. Parents, caregivers, and outcome assessors were unaware of group assignment. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed or clinically suspected late-onset infection (occurring &gt;72 h after birth), which was assessed in all participants for whom primary outcome data was available by calculating the relative risk ratio with 95% CI between the two groups. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number 88261002.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>We recruited 2203 participants between May 7, 2014, and Sept 28, 2017, of whom 1099 were assigned to the lactoferrin group and 1104 to the control group. Four infants had consent withdrawn or unconfirmed, leaving 1098 infants in the lactoferrin group and 1101 in the sucrose group. Primary outcome data for 2182 infants (1093 [99·5%] of 1098 in the lactoferrin group and 1089 [99·0] of 1101 in the control group) were available for inclusion in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. 316 (29%) of 1093 infants in the intervention group acquired a late-onset infection versus 334 (31%) of 1089 in the control group. The risk ratio adjusted for minimisation factors was 0·95 (95% CI 0·86–1·04; p=0·233). During the trial there were 16 serious adverse events for infants in the lactoferrin group and 10 for infants in the control group. Two events in the lactoferrin group (one case of blood in stool and one death after intestinal perforation) were assessed as being possibly related to the trial intervention.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Enteral supplementation with bovine lactoferrin does not reduce the risk of late-onset infection in very preterm infants. These data do not support its routine use to prevent late-onset infection and associated morbidity or mortality in very preterm infants.</p>

              <p id="para170">Late-onset infection (occurring &gt;72 h after birth) is the most common serious complication associated with hospital care for preterm infants. The James Lind Alliance Preterm Birth Priority Setting Partnership has identified the development and assessment of improved methods to prevent infection in preterm infants as a research priority.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para180">The prevalence of late-onset infection is estimated to be higher than 20% in very preterm infants (ie, born before 32 weeks' gestation) reflecting their duration of exposure to invasive procedures and intensive care.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Very preterm infants who acquire a late-onset infection have an increased risk of mortality and acute morbidities, including necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Late-onset infection is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes including visual, hearing, and cognitive impairment, and cerebral palsy.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Very preterm infants with late-onset infection spend a longer time in hospital than similar infants without infection.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Late-onset infection has major consequences for health-care service management, delivery, and costs.</p>
              <p id="para190">Lactoferrin, a member of the transferrin family of iron-binding glycoproteins, is a key component of the mammalian innate response to infection. It is the major whey protein in human breast milk, present at a concentration of about 1 mg/mL. Lactoferrin has broad microbiocidal activity by mechanisms such as cell-membrane disruption, iron sequestration, inhibition of microbial adhesion to host cells, and prevention of biofilm formation.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Lactoferrin also promotes the growth of probiotic bacteria, stimulates differentiation and proliferation of enterocytes and expression of intestinal digestive enzymes, and has direct intestinal immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory actions including suppression of free-radical activity.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para220">The 2011 version of the Cochrane review of enteral lactoferrin supplementation in very preterm infants included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) done in 11 Italian neonatal centres. This trial, in which 331 infants participated, suggested that enteral supplementation with bovine lactoferrin reduced the incidence of late-onset infection by two thirds compared with controls. No evidence of an effect on mortality was found and no adverse effects or intolerance were reported. Because the effect size estimate might have been inflated by performance and detection bias and by other methodological weaknesses, the Cochrane review concluded that this evidence was insufficient to support a change in practice.</p>
                  <p id="para230">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para240">The ELFIN trial shows that enteral supplementation of bovine lactoferrin (150 mg/kg per day until 34 weeks postmenstrual age) does not reduce the risk of late-onset infection, other morbidity, or mortality in very preterm infants. This is the largest trial of this intervention and the validity is enhanced by the methodological quality and power. The findings are broadly applicable to very preterm infants cared for in facilities in well resourced health services. There was no indication of any beneficial effects for infants with additional risk factors for late-onset infection, including extreme preterm birth</p>
                  <p id="para250">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para260">The ELFIN trial findings contradict the existing evidence base and illustrate why high-quality evidence from adequately powered RCTs is needed to inform policy and practice. The 2017 update of the Cochrane review includes six RCTs, but most were small and some contained other design and methodological weaknesses that might have introduced biases resulting in overestimation of the effect sizes. With more than twice as many participants than had been enrolled in all of the previous trials combined, the ELFIN trial generated more precise estimates of effect, and provides valid and applicable evidence that enteral bovine lactoferrin supplementation does not reduce the risk of late-onset infection or other morbidity or mortality in very preterm infants.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="para270">Very preterm infants typically ingest little or no milk during the early neonatal period and have low intake of lactoferrin.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The low lactoferrin intake in the early neonatal period is exacerbated by any delays in establishing enteral feeding. Enteral supplementation with bovine lactoferrin has been proposed as a simple strategy to compensate for this immunodeficiency.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Bovine lactoferrin is about 70% homologous with human lactoferrin but has higher antimicrobial activity.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> It is inexpensive compared with human or recombinant lactoferrin, is available commercially as a food supplement in a stable powder form, and is “generally recognised as safe” by the US Food and Drug Administration.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The no-observed-adverse-effect level is more than 2 g/kg per day in rats.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The European Food Safety Authority Panel concludes that bovine lactoferrin is safe for infants at the standard supplementation concentration (up to 210 mg/kg of bodyweight per day).<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para280">The 2017 Cochrane review<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> of enteral lactoferrin supplementation for preterm infants includes six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1071 participants in total. Meta-analyses suggest that lactoferrin supplementation reduces the risk of late-onset infection by about 40%. The risk of necrotising enterocolitis was found to decrease by about 60%. No adverse effects or intolerance were reported. Since the included trials were small and contained methodological weaknesses associated with selection and performance bias, and since meta-analyses were limited by data availability and heterogeneity, the assessment of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group of the quality of this evidence was low. The authors of the Cochrane review<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> concluded that data from large, good-quality RCTs of lactoferrin supplementation in very preterm infants were needed to enhance the validity and applicability of the evidence to inform practice.</p>

Parents remained free to withdraw their infant from the trial at any time without providing a reason or explanation. Parents were aware that this decision would have no impact on any aspects of their infant's care.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="para320">To confirm participant eligibility, investigators supplied gestational age, sex, and time of birth. To proceed to randomisation, investigators confirmed that signed informed consent was available. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either bovine lactoferrin (lactoferrin group) or sucrose (control group) using a minimisation algorithm to ensure balance between the groups in recruiting site (neonatal unit), sex, single versus multiple births, and gestational age in completed weeks. Twins or higher-order multiple birth infants were randomly allocated individually. Infants were considered to have been enrolled once they had been given a unique study number and allocated a treatment pack identification number. Allocation of participants was done via a secure web-based randomisation facility at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU), University of Oxford. Telephone assistance and randomisation back-up was available at all times. Parents, clinicians, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to group assignment. Clinicians could unmask a participant's allocation via the randomisation website using a single-use access code provided in a sealed envelope. The reason for unmasking had to be recorded. Unmasking was only permitted if it was an emergency situation in which knowledge of treatment allocation was needed to guide the clinical management of the participant.</p>
                <p id="para330">Dry bovine lactoferrin has a pale pink-brown tinge whereas sucrose was very light brown. The opaque containers used to store the products did not allow them to be seen unless the sealed stopper was removed intentionally. The lactoferrin powder had similar granularity to sucrose so that when—before the addition of water and milk (see further details in the procedures section)—either product was shaken within the opaque, sealed pots it was not possible to distinguish lactoferrin from sucrose by the sound generated. Mixing the lactoferrin with sterile water and milk (either breast milk or formula) generated foam that settled within 30 min after shaking. When the mixed lactoferrin was removed in a syringe with a purple plunger, the pink tinge to the lactoferrin was disguised by the colour of the milk which often resulted in a light brown colour, which varied markedly between batches of milk. As lactoferrin was more likely than sucrose to retain a light pink tinge, we supplied all sites with a laminated picture of a range of possible colours for the lactoferrin mixture in syringes, and stressed that this applied to both lactoferrin and sucrose.</p>

                <p id="para340">Trial participants were allocated to receive either bovine lactoferrin (Tatua Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd, Morrinsville, New Zealand) or sucrose (British Sugar, Peterborough, UK).</p>
                <p id="para350">The investigational medicinal product (IMP) was processed at the UK Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA)—approved National Health Service clinical-trials pharmacy unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK (MHRA Manufacturer's Authorisations for IMP 17136). The lactoferrin manufacturer's certificate of analysis confirmed absence of contamination from bovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, as per European Medicines Evaluation Agency standards. The pharmacy independently confirmed IMP purity and uniformity, sterility, low humidity, temperature stability, and processing as per good manufacturing practice standards before the batch was released by the designated qualified person.</p>
                <p id="para360">The IMP was packaged in individual doses (375 mg) in 25 mL sealed, opaque pharmacy pots and assembled into participant packs. Boxes containing 24 identically numbered pots were labelled with the same pack identification number to indicate that they belonged to the same treatment course. At randomisation, the study number was added to the label of the allocated pack with the infant's name and date of birth for checking before each administration of the IMP.</p>
                <p id="para370">The IMP was prescribed at a dose of 150 mg/kg bodyweight per day (up to a maximum of 300 mg/day) and prepared for administration by addition by syringe of sterile water (4 mL) plus expressed breast milk or formula (1 mL). The pot was shaken vigorously by hand for 30 s to generate a mixture containing 75mg/mL of IMP. The mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min before removal for administration using an enteral feeding syringe.</p>
                <p id="para380">The IMP was administered once daily via gastric tube once the infant's enteral feed volume was more than 12 mL/kg per day and continued until 34 weeks' postmenstrual age. Infants could have had the dose split at the discretion of the responsible clinical team. All other aspects of care, including the timing of the commencement of enteral feeds and the type of milk feed used were as per local policy, practice, and discretion. Administration of the trial IMP might have been stopped temporarily. Missed doses did not necessitate the removal of an infant from the trial. Data continued to be collected as per protocol if the trial medication was stopped. As participants were inpatients in a neonatal unit they were monitored continuously, and samples were only collected when indicated clinically. When an infant completed the course of treatment, any unused IMP pots were accounted for and destroyed.</p>

All other serious adverse events were reported by trial sites to the NPEU Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) within 24 h of being recognised. A standard operating procedure outlining the reporting procedure for clinicians was provided with the serious adverse events form and in the trial handbook. The NPEU CTU processed and reported the event as specified in its own standard operating procedures. All serious adverse events were reviewed by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) at regular intervals throughout the trial.

This target sample size of 2200 allowed for an anticipated loss to follow-up of up to 5%.</p>

Safety data were collected for all participants randomly assigned to groups. Comparative analyses calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI for the primary outcome (99% CIs for all other dichotomous outcomes), the mean difference (99% CI) for normally distributed continuous outcomes, or the median difference (99% CI) for skewed continuous variables.</p>
                <p id="para490">The groups were compared using regression analysis adjusting for the minimisation factors (ie, collaborating hospital, sex, gestational age at birth, and single or multiple birth) to account for the correlation between treatment groups introduced by balancing the randomisation. For all binary outcomes, we used mixed effect Poisson models with robust standard errors. Centre was fitted as a random effect and mother's identification nested within this to take account of clustering within centre and within multiples. The other minimisation factors were fitted as a fixed effect with sex and multiplicity of birth included as binary variables and gestational age modelled as a continuous variable. For all length-of-stay outcomes and the number of days of administration of antimicrobials, we used quantile regression with sex and multiplicity of birth included as binary variables and gestational age modelled as a continuous variable. The crude unadjusted and adjusted estimates were calculated with the primary inference to be based on the adjusted analysis.</p>

Consent was not confirmed for one infant in the lactoferrin group and withdrawn for three infants in the placebo group; these infants were not included in the analysis of outcomes at discharge. Therefore, in total, 1098 infants in the lactoferrin group and 1101 in the placebo group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. Data were not available for five infants in the lactoferrin group and 12 infants in the control group; hence, 1093 infants in the lactoferrin group and 1089 in the placebo group were included in the primary and secondary outcome analyses.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para630">Our data indicate that enteral lactoferrin supplementation (150 mg/kg per day until 34 weeks' postmenstrual age) does not reduce the risk of late-onset infection, other morbidity, or mortality in very preterm infants. This contradicts previous trial findings. The 2017 Cochrane review<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> includes six RCTs, and meta-analyses suggest substantial reductions in late-onset infection and necrotising enterocolitis associated with lactoferrin supplementation in very preterm infants. These trials, however, were small and some contained design and methodological weaknesses that might have introduced performance and detection biases resulting in over-estimation of the treatment effects. Given these concerns, the Cochrane review graded the evidence for key outcomes as low quality and concluded that data from large, methodologically-rigorous RCTs were needed to generate evidence of sufficient validity to inform policy and practice.</p>
              <p id="para640">The ELFIN trial provides such evidence. We used practices to limit bias, such as central web-based randomisation for allocation concealment; masking of parents, caregivers, and investigators to the group allocation; and complete follow-up and assessment of the trial cohort with intention-to-treat analyses based on a prespecified statistical-analysis plan. The trial achieved recruitment of 2203 participants as per protocol, which was based on an a priori sample-size estimation. Demographic and prognostic characteristics were well balanced at randomisation. Interim analyses by the trial's independent DMC used criteria to minimise the chances of spurious findings due to data fluctuations before a sufficient sample size was achieved.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Adherence to the intervention was high, the proportion of protocol violations was low, and outcome data were available for more than 99% of the cohort. Event prevalence for the outcomes was broadly similar to that anticipated.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Consequently, the trial had sufficient power and validity to detect reliably modest yet important effects on the risk of late-onset infection and other morbidity.</p>
              <p id="para650">The ELFIN trial enrolled more than twice as many infants than had participated in all of the existing trials combined and generated more precise estimates of effect size than were previously available. Our relative risk estimate (0·95, 95% CI 0·86–1·04) for the primary outcome is consistent with a possible risk reduction of up to 14% and an increase in risk of up to 4%. These estimates were consistent across gestational age bands, making it unlikely that bovine lactoferrin has any important benefits for extremely preterm infants (ie, born before 28 weeks' gestation) who have an increased risk of infection. Similarly, although plausible that lactoferrin might have had different effects in infants with low levels of exposure to the immuno-protective factors present in human milk, we did not show any interaction with the type of enteral milk feeds received during the trial period (human milk, formula, or both).</p>
              <p id="para660">The largest previous trial<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> of enteral lactoferrin supplementation, in which 331 very low-birthweight infants in a neonatal unit in Italy participated, showed a relative risk reduction of 66% (risk ratio 0·34, 95% CI 0·17–0·70) for late-onset infection. The participants and the intervention were broadly similar to the ELFIN trial, as were enteral-feeding practices, including receipt of human breast milk versus formula. However, key differences in the epidemiology of late-onset infection, as well as in infection-prevention practices and exposure to other interventions, might have contributed to the difference in effects size estimates shown in the two trials. Notably, the prevalence of invasive fungal infection was very high in the Italian trial (7·7% of the control group) and a substantial proportion of the overall effect on reducing late-onset invasive infection was due to the effect on preventing invasive fungal infection. By contrast, the overall prevalence of late-onset fungal infection was low in the ELFIN trial (five episodes in total), consistent with that reported in UK surveillance studies.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para670">A limitation of our study was that pre-specified primary outcome included both clinically suspected and microbiologically confirmed late-onset infection. We took this pragmatic approach because of concerns about the diagnostic accuracy of microbiological culture of blood in this population.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Standard microbiological culture might not detect cases of bacteraemia or fungaemia if an insufficient volume of the infant's blood is incubated (ie, false-negative result). Conversely, microbiological cultures can also generate false-positive results if blood sampling techniques allow entry of contaminating microorganisms (typically from the infant's skin). To mitigate these potential sources of bias, we used an established consensus case definition that required additional evidence of infection (clinical signs or biomarkers) and mandated that clinicians indicate an intention to treat the infant with antibiotics or antifungals for at least 5 days.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para680">Given that a postulated mechanism of action of lactoferrin is to reduce bowel translocation of enteric pathogens, we assessed post-hoc whether invasive infections with particular groups of enteric organisms were reduced. We did not find any evidence that lactoferrin supplementation affected the risk of late-onset infection with different groups of infecting microorganism including Gram-negative bacteria (mainly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other enterobacteriaceae).</p>
              <p id="para690">In a post-hoc subgroup analysis of infants who had or had not received routine probiotic supplementation during the trial period, we did not show any difference in the effect of lactoferrin on the risk of late-onset infection. A previous trial<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and the 2017 Cochrane review<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> have suggested that combining supplementation of lactoferrin with the probiotic microorganism <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG was associated with a greater reduction in the risk of late-onset infection and necrotising enterocolitis than was lactoferrin supplementation alone. This raises the possibility that the immunoprotective and prebiotic properties of lactoferrin might act synergistically with probiotic supplementation.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Although the ELFIN trial did not show any evidence of differential effects depending upon whether infants had received probiotics during the trial period, the data are not sufficient to exclude the possibility that such prebiotic–probiotic synergism exists. A 2017 large cluster RCT<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> in India has suggested that prophylactic administration of an oral synbiotic (prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharide combined with probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>) reduces infection and mortality in late-preterm or term newborn infants. We are doing a mechanistic study<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> in a subgroup of ELFIN trial participants to analyse whether and how lactoferrin supplementation affects the intestinal microbiome and metabolite profile. The study, which is ongoing, will explore changes in microbiomic and metabolomic patterns preceding disease onset, including necrotising enterocolitis and late-onset infection.</p>
              <p id="para700">Estimates for the secondary outcomes indicated consistently that lactoferrin supplementation does not have important effects on the risk of major morbidities. We prespecified an analysis of the effect on a composite of infection, necrotising enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, or death. The adjusted risk ratio point estimate was 1·01 (95% CI 0·94–1·08), which is consistent with a possible risk reduction of up to 6% and a possible increase in risk of up to 8%. We plan to increase the precision of the estimates of effect on rare secondary outcomes by combining these data in a meta-analysis with other trials, including a recently completed Australasian RCT of bovine-lactoferrin supplementation for very low-birthweight infants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12611000247976.aspx" id="interrefs30">Lactoferrin Infant Feeding Trial</ext-link>; unpublished).</p>
              <p id="para710">Since late-onset infection and necrotising enterocolitis are the major reasons for receipt of invasive interventions and high levels of care in very preterm infants, it is not surprising that we did not find any effects on the degree of exposure to antimicrobial drugs, on the duration of hospitalisation, or on stay in intensive or high-dependency care settings. Given that the ELFIN trial did not show any differences between groups in the risk of morbidity or on levels of care received, we did not undertake further analyses of health-care costs as had been proposed in our approved funding application and trial protocol. We did not do a within-trial health economic analysis or use these data in a model to explore long-term family and health-service costs since these are mainly driven by the consequences of infection and other morbidity during the initial hospitalisation. Without evidence of clinical effectiveness on these infant-important outcomes, we considered a cost-effectiveness analysis of lactoferrin supplementation to be futile.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para720">We do not plan to apply for permission and funding to assess longer-term outcomes of trial participants. We specified in our protocol that if the trial did not detect significant or clinically important differences in the in-hospital outcomes, then follow-up would not be done since any between-group differences in growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes are predicated largely on differences in the prevalence of late-onset infections, necrotising enterocolitis, and associated morbidities.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Since these were not shown, there is no longer an impelling rationale for expecting lactoferrin supplementation to have an effect on long-term growth or development.</p>
              <p id="para730">The ELFIN trial findings are likely to be applicable in the UK and internationally. The trial population was representative of very preterm infants cared for within health-care facilities in well resourced health services and included a substantial proportion of extremely preterm infants and of infants with other putative risk factors for neonatal morbidity. Overall, about 30% of participants acquired a microbiologically confirmed or clinically suspected late-onset infection, and about 17% in total had a microbiologically confirmed infection, consistent with prevalence values reported from cohort studies and other RCTs. Similarly, the prevalence of necrotising enterocolitis (about 5%) was similar to that reported in large, population-based surveillance and cohort studies and RCTs.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para740">In conclusion, the ELFIN trial does not support the routine use of enteral bovine lactoferrin supplementation to prevent late-onset infection or other morbidity or mortality in very preterm infants. Research efforts should continue to investigate the aetiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of late-onset infection and related morbidities, and to develop, refine, and assess other interventions that could prevent or reduce adverse acute and long-term consequences for very preterm infants and their families.</p>
