                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They are therefore recommended to follow a healthy diet and be physically active in order to reduce that risk. However, achieving and maintaining these behaviours in the postpartum period is challenging. This study sought to explore women’s views on suggested practical approaches to achieve and maintain a healthy diet and physical activity to reduce T2DM risk.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants in Cambridgeshire, UK were conducted at three to 48 months after GDM. The participants’ current diet and physical activity, intentions for any changes, and views on potential interventions to help manage T2DM risk through these behaviours were discussed. Framework analysis was used to analyse the transcripts. The interview schedule, suggested interventions, and thematic framework were based on a recent systematic review.</p>

                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Most of the participants wanted to eat more healthily and be more active. A third of the participants considered that postpartum support for these behaviours would be transformative, a third thought it would be beneficial, and a third did not want additional support. The majority agreed that more information about the impact of diet and physical activity on diabetes risk, support to exercise with others, and advice about eating healthily, exercising with a busy schedule, monitoring progress and sustaining changes would facilitate a healthy diet and physical activity. Four other suggested interventions received mixed responses. It would be acceptable for this support to be delivered throughout pregnancy and postpartum through a range of formats. Clinicians were seen to have important roles in giving or signposting to support.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Many women would appreciate more support to reduce their T2DM risk after GDM and believe that a variety of interventions to integrate changes into their daily lives would help them to sustain healthier lifestyles.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>An estimated 17.8 million pregnancies resulting in live births were affected by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) worldwide in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Estimates of prevalence vary greatly within and between regions and countries: the Middle East and North Africa have the highest prevalence at a median 12.9% of pregnancies affected (range 8.4 to 24.5%) and Europe has the lowest prevalence at 5.8% (range 1.8 to 22.3%) [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, prevalence is 10.1% (95% confidence interval 6.5% to 15.7%) [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Approximately 5% of UK pregnancies were affected in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Compared to women of an ethnicity associated with a high risk of GDM who are born in a Western country, many women who migrated from their native country to a Western country have higher rates of GDM [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>GDM is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications in both mother and baby, and maternal cardiometabolic disorders in later life [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Approximately a third of women with GDM are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by 15 years postpartum, with recent data suggesting that the increased risk is sustained over time since GDM rather than being limited to the first few years after delivery [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. T2DM risk factors including high body mass index (BMI) and ethnicity further increase T2DM risk in women who have had GDM: development of T2DM is 18% (95% confidence interval 5–34%) higher per unit BMI at follow-up, and 57% (95% confidence interval 39–70%) lower in White European populations compared to other populations (adjusting for ethnicity and follow-up) [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Women from Asia were found to have the highest incidence rate of T2DM after GDM at 46 cases per 1,000 person-years [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Factors such as poorer pregnancy glucose tolerance requiring treatment with insulin have been found to further increase risk of T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Overall, women who had GDM are 7–10 times more likely to develop T2DM over their lifetime than women with normoglycaemic pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>In addition to lifelong annual screening for diabetes after pregnancy, women with GDM should be offered postpartum lifestyle advice regarding weight control, diet and exercise [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, most women who have had GDM do not attempt or sustain changes to reduce modifiable risk factors but maintain lifestyles that increase their diabetes risk, and many show discrepancy between T2DM risk perception and behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Existing behaviour change interventions have focused on promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, while others have supported breastfeeding after GDM [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Intervention modes include group, individual and remote interventions, or a combination of approaches [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Positive effects on preventing T2DM progression are frequently observed but can be limited due to poor engagement, particularly in intensive interventions like the US Diabetes Prevention Programme, in this population [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>In order to understand the facilitators and barriers towards lifestyle in women with a history of GDM, we conducted a qualitative synthesis of their views on reducing their risk of developing diabetes postpartum through lifestyle and behaviour changes [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We found that women who had had GDM identified themselves primarily as mothers who prioritised their family above themselves [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This motivated some to adopt healthy diets and to be active, but a need for resources, time, energy, information and support prevented others from making changes [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. From these findings, we developed a set of recommendations for promoting a healthy lifestyle after GDM [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Only one of the 21 included studies was set in the UK (interviews with 35 women in total to explore influences on postpartum health behaviours and the feasibility of diabetes prevention intervention [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) and we are aware of only one other UK study that has been completed more recently (interviews or focus groups with 50 women in total also to explore influences on postpartum health behaviours and preferences for lifestyle support [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]).</p>
              <p>There is therefore a gap in recent literature in the UK population surrounding the acceptability of recommendations for intervention after GDM in a real-life context. In this study, we sought to address this gap by exploring the views of women with a history of GDM on possible interventions to support healthy diet and physical activity to reduce diabetes risk, in addition to participants’ own suggestions. We aimed to identify the most promising interventions for future development.</p>

              <sec id="sec007">
                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited from the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge and Peterborough Hospital. These sites were chosen to provide socioeconomic and ethnic diversity, and represent views from those attending both secondary and tertiary centres offering GDM and obstetric care. Posters were displayed at antenatal clinics to promote awareness of the study. Research midwives identified eligible participants from medical records, and sent them a postal or email invitation and participant information sheet describing the study. Those who were interested in taking part contacted the midwives, and the study researcher (the first author) called them to provide an opportunity to ask questions and arrange the interview.</p>
                <p>We planned to interview approximately 20 women in order to reach data saturation, a comparatively large sample size based on the relatively low information power anticipated [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This was because this study had a broad aim (to explore the participants’ views on potential interventions) and the sample was not very specific (participants had a recent history of GDM but no criteria relating to lifestyle behaviours). One the other hand, the interview schedule and framework analysis were structured around the recommendations made in our systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which increases the information power. As widely recommended for data saturation [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we finished recruitment after several interviews did not lead to novel findings. We interviewed all 20 participants who wanted to take part. Although we did not record the final number invited, uptake was estimated to be around 50% for women spoken to directly and around 5% for women who were sent a letter or email only.</p>

                <title>Inclusion criteria</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited if they had any history of GDM, were over 18 years old, and between 12 weeks and four years postpartum. This timeframe was chosen to allow sufficient time for new mothers to recover from pregnancy and attend postpartum follow-up, and so that all pregnancies were managed according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines that were updated in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NICE recommends screening for GDM with a 75g 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in women with one or more risk factors (BMI greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, previous baby weighing 4.5 kg or more, previous pregnancy affected by GDM, family history of diabetes, and ethnicity with a high prevalence of diabetes) [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Diagnostic cut-offs were defined according to local protocols: at Peterborough Hospital, those with a fasting value ≥5.6 mmol/l or 2 hour value of ≥7.8 mmol/l were diagnosed with GDM (NICE guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]); at the Rosie Hospital, those with a fasting value ≥5.1 mmol/l, 1 hour value of ≥10.0 mmol/l or 2 hour value of ≥8.5 mmol/l were diagnosed with GDM (International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). Screening usually takes place at 24 to 28 weeks gestation, although can be repeated if the clinicians suspect GDM has developed. Following GDM diagnosis, women are closely managed with the aim of reducing glycaemia. This involves blood glucose monitoring, diet and exercise, and sometimes insulin and metformin medication.</p>
                <p>Women who had experienced adverse pregnancy outcomes (such as stillbirth, neonatal death or major congenital anomaly), participated in a pregnancy or GDM-related intervention that was in addition to or in place of routine care (such as a clinical trial) or were considered unsuitable for any other reason at the discretion of the midwives who had access to their medical records were not invited.</p>

                <title>Interview process</title>
                <p>A single semi-structured interview was conducted at the time and private place of the participants’ choice. Children were welcomed in order to facilitate attendance. Firstly, the interviewer (the first author) introduced herself (as a public health PhD student with training in qualitative methods but little interviewing experience) and the purpose of the interview (to listen to their experiences of GDM pregnancy and, particularly, postpartum in order to improve support). Participants then gave written informed consent, confirming that they understood the purpose and procedure of the study and that they could stop the interview at any point, and were happy for it to be audio-recorded.</p>
                <p>Our previous systematic review informed the interview guide and suggestion cards, which were adapted from 20 recommendations (<xref rid="pone.0262852.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0262852.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The first part of the interview focused on diet and physical activity while the second part focused on screening for T2DM (reported separately [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]); ten suggestion cards were used as prompts in each part. We conducted three pilot interviews and collected written feedback from our patient and public involvement group, composed of mothers with GDM. This feedback was incorporated into the final version, which was refined after reflection on the first interviews. This involved changing the first question of the interview schedule from asking about their current diet (which we expected would be an easy discussion topic) to asking them to describe “what your GDM pregnancy was like for you”. Although this was not the focus of the interview and sometimes brought up upsetting accounts, the participants appreciated being able to tell their ‘story’ and it proved to be useful context for the remainder of the interview. Additionally, more signposting was incorporated into the interview such as “to help us understand any lasting impact GDM might have had…” or “before we talk about exercise, I’d like to ask you about your diet…”.</p>

                <p>Participants were first asked to share their experience of GDM in order to understand the background for their behaviours and attitudes. They then described their current dietary and physical activity habits and perceptions of the influence of GDM. We discussed whether any support for these behaviours would be helpful, and what format might be most effective (such as online, face-to-face with clinicians, peer support groups, etc.). Participants were asked about their own ideas first, then to comment on the ten suggestion cards provided by the interviewer (e.g. whether they agreed, disagreed or would add anything). It was emphasised that disagreement (they probably would not find that intervention helpful) as equally useful to hear as agreement (they might find that intervention helpful). If the participants did not want to make any further changes themselves, they were asked what they thought might help others with GDM based on their own experience. Prompts were used as required. Occasionally the interviewer decided not to show a particular participant a suggestion card if she considered that it was not appropriate given the earlier content of the interview and sometimes the participant did not provide clear feedback (e.g. due to natural distractions or initiating a different train of thought). We then discussed how to facilitate attendance at diabetes screening after GDM in the second part of the interview [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Finally, demographic information (including age band, ethnic group, employment status and pregnancy history) and interview feedback were collected through a short questionnaire. The interviewer recorded reflexive field notes on each interview including the context (e.g. setting, if anyone else was nearby) and subjective reflections.</p>

                <p>To supplement the qualitative analysis, we classified the participants’ collective response to each suggestion card as overall agreement, disagreement or mixed in order to create a general indication or impression of their views. The classification was based on the authors’ interpretations of the participants’ responses: whilst we counted the number of agreements or disagreements, we also considered the vigour with which each participant responded.

              <p>Many participants had made significant lifestyle changes during pregnancy to manage GDM, and felt as if GDM had ruined their pregnancy or their lives had revolved around their blood glucose levels. The perception of care they received during pregnancy was mostly very good, yet several mentioned not wanting to have another child in fear of GDM.</p>
              <p>Overall, the participants were eager to make changes to and take responsibility for their health. Many highlighted the importance of their individual mindset and desire to be helped. Seven participants had sufficient knowledge about healthy diet and exercise going forward, or knew where to find more support if they needed it. Seven participants acknowledged that more postpartum follow-up would be helpful, but they had been able to manage. The remaining participants reported sentiments such as “<italic toggle="yes">I don’t feel like I’ve been given the help that I think there should be really out there</italic>” [Participant 1, attempting healthier postpartum lifestyle but felt unsupported overall], “<italic toggle="yes">post-GDM support would be really good for mothers</italic>” [P2, healthier, unsupported] and two participants explained that they had been unaware of an association between GDM and T2DM. Those who had struggled through pregnancy found the postpartum period particularly challenging.</p>
              <p>The participants’ views on suggestions to support a healthy postpartum diet and physical activity are summarised in <xref rid="pone.0262852.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, plus <xref rid="pone.0262852.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref> indicates their agreement with each suggestion card. Many of the participants were positive towards the suggestions despite already making healthy changes. Others had mixed responses because they had specific questions, and one participant felt that “<italic toggle="yes">they’re [the suggestion cards] all quite similar</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">aren’t they</italic>? <italic toggle="yes">You know</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I think I know those things already…</italic>” [P3, not attempting healthier lifestyle].</p>

                <p>Most of the participants felt that they would benefit from more information about the impact of healthy behaviours on their diabetes risk. Some would add this to existing knowledge, whereas others had poor awareness of the long-term implications of GDM because they hadn’t been told or remembered. It was important that information was adapted to mothers who had had GDM and perceived themselves to be knowledgeable (“<italic toggle="yes">not sort of trivial</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">such as ‘eat a healthy balanced diet</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">exercise more’</italic>” [P6, healthier, supported], and focused on how to be healthy in relation to T2DM.</p>
                <p>Opinions varied about information on the impact of healthy diet and exercise on their wider health since most already had general awareness or found that this was covered by existing postpartum support, such as that provided by children’s centres.</p>

                <title>Improving diet (suggestion card 6)</title>
                <p>The majority of the participants were attempting to eat healthily by continuing elements of their GDM diet. Further guidance or tips would help them to do this because they received little or no information about what to eat after delivery (in contrast to pregnancy).</p>
                <p>A couple of participants were uncertain because the GDM diet wasn’t a ‘normal’ healthy diet, such as eating peanut butter instead of fruit. Others wanted advice that was relevant to other aspects of their new situation, including managing cravings, balancing healthy diet with calorie intake for breastfeeding, with children of different ages, and different family mealtimes. It was important for advice to be individualised (“<italic toggle="yes">how to keep your diet… right for you</italic>” [P1, healthier, unsupported]) and in accordance with their palate or culture.</p>
                <p>Two participants thought that they had the necessary knowledge but that other people did not. Three participants already had enough information by drawing on previous experiences and GDM diets.</p>

                <title>Improving physical activity (suggestion cards 5 and 7)</title>
                <p>Although many participants reported doing less physical activity than before pregnancy, several prioritised running (while their partner looked after the children), dance classes or home workouts. Others did lower-intensity activity, like pushing the buggy. Many wanted to do more exercise, and felt this would be achievable when the children were older, they finished breastfeeding, or had better recovered from pregnancy.</p>
                <p>Help to exercise with others was frequently considered to facilitate physical activity because it had helped them in the past or they walked with others now, or it might make exercise less boring. Some preferred mother-and-baby classes or GDM groups, which would be accessible, and could provide an opportunity for socialising and sharing experiences alongside exercise. Local groups might need signposting because they didn’t know where to find them or hadn’t thought to look. Conversely, a few felt distracted when exercising with others or liked to exercise at their own pace.</p>
                <p>Almost all the participants were eager for advice about how to be active alongside a busy schedule (including around the home and exercise for the whole family together), explaining that was the thing they had issues with and hadn’t received any advice about. Appropriateness for postpartum period was important: one participant suggested cards with postpartum-friendly exercises “<italic toggle="yes">like little diagrams and exercise routine that build the further on you get in your health… especially to what kind of birth you’ve had</italic>” [P16, healthier, unsupported]. Several participants shared what had helped them, including splitting exercise throughout the day and using a baby carrier.</p>

                <title>Family (suggestion cards 3 and 4)</title>
                <p>A young family made having a healthy lifestyle harder than it used to be due to increased demands on their time, and the need to meet others’ dietary preferences/requirements. On the other hand, parenthood could provide new opportunities: one participant’s older child encouraged her to exercise, and others walked with their antenatal groups. Some also found that their children motivated them to be healthier because they wanted to stay well for their family, prevent unhealthy habits in their children, and/or their partners wanted to be healthier too after they both learnt more about diabetes.</p>
                <p>They therefore had mixed views regarding whether more information about the impact of healthy diet and exercise on their family would help them. Some participants reasoned that being healthy was something they would do as a family whereas others felt that it was only relevant to themselves. Others already knew the information, or it had been provided by their health visitor (although not everyone received this kind of guidance). Similarly, the suggestion of ways for the family to be healthier received mixed agreement; those that agreed wanted practical tips for fitting a healthy lifestyle in with family life, ideas for activities involving wider family and friends, and how to easily adapt child-friendly recipes for parents.</p>

                <title>Money (suggestion card 9)</title>
                <p>Twelve participants were in favour of advice about saving money and maintaining a healthy lifestyle because they found generic advice could not be applied to diabetes prevention. They also needed healthy options for the family to do, particularly because costs increased with a larger/growing family. Conversely, other participants considered that cost didn’t prevent a healthy lifestyle because cheap or free options were available. Some noted that cooking from scratch was already cheaper than buying prepared food; they therefore had fewer options for saving more money.</p>

                <p>Almost all of the participants had positive views towards monitoring their progress after pregnancy, anticipating it to make a big difference. They discussed either monitoring themselves (by recording their weight, diet, exercise, calories in and out, or ‘nice’ things like visiting the park) or through meeting with a health professional. Importantly, it was seen as a way to maintain motivation for changes through seeing their achievements and the benefits, or recreate targets like they had during pregnancy. A health professional could give more information and feedback on individual diabetes risk and blood glucose control. At the same time, several were cautious that monitoring could have the opposite effect: seeing weight increase could be demoralising and involving others might be stressful.</p>

                <p>With the exception of those who were not attempting to eat a healthier diet and exercise more, the participants wanted advice about sustaining changes and knew that maintaining a healthy lifestyle would be challenging. In practice, they felt that sustainability could be facilitated through the earlier themes; for example, that advice about healthy food that is suitable for the whole family, exercises that can be done around the house, and more follow-up will all help them to maintain behaviours to reduce their risk of T2DM.</p>

                  <title>Appointments with healthcare professionals</title>
                  <p>This was the most frequently suggested intervention. Midwives, hospital diabetes teams, health visitors and GPs had provided GDM care and were a trustworthy and respected source of information.</p>
                  <p>Most participants were keen to receive advice about postpartum diet and exercise, and long-term diabetes risk during pregnancy. It would be good to be briefed while they were most aware of GDM, knowing that more information would follow. Only one participant felt that this would overwhelm her because there was already too much to think about during pregnancy.</p>
                  <p>Similarly, four participants felt that follow-up should be mentioned, in a casual way, while they were on the maternity ward or alongside other discharge information. Women who had more complicated births spent more time in hospital and generally felt abandoned with regards to GDM at that time, therefore would like the opportunity to make sure that they “<italic toggle="yes">knew the plan of action</italic>” with a professional [P4, not healthier]. One participant disagreed because she lost all of the many discharge papers she was given.</p>
                  <p>Thirteen participants discussed attending postpartum appointments with a clinician. Many suggested that GDM follow-up become part of the six-week mother-and-baby healthcheck with the GP, which would be after the initial overwhelming stage. In practice, this appointment focused on the baby, which was very important, but they too needed time with an expert to debrief: to be asked how they were, have some reassurance, discuss what to do next and, notably, receive feedback on each blood test result.</p>

Support would then be available at all times, including during night feeds. One proposed a “<italic toggle="yes">website that can make suggestions or to have a community of people with GDM who share recipes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">what their concerns are</italic>” [P11, healthier, unsupported], because social media groups had the potential to be informative and supportive.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we explored the views of 20 mothers with recent GDM towards suggested support for having a healthy diet and being active in light of their T2DM risk. These women thought that additional advice about how to eat healthily and exercise when they were busy, and practical suggestions for making these changes sustainable in their context, would most help them to reduce their risk of T2DM. Many wanted more individualised information about their long-term risk of T2DM after GDM, and how they might mitigate that risk, but they often knew enough about the overall benefits of a healthy lifestyle. Although written information in any format would be acceptable, access to other mothers with GDM and a clinician talking to them about follow-up in a supportive manner was anticipated to be beneficial.</p>
              <p>The DAiSIeS study was designed to build on our recent qualitative synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], bridging the gap between barriers and facilitators to diabetes prevention behaviours and intervention programme design. Comparing the findings of that review [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and this interview study, we found that influences on healthy diet and exercise were similar, such as spending time with children instead of exercising and how the family could facilitate healthy behaviours. We had reported a lack of time and energy as barriers to healthy lifestyles; this was also true in this interview study, particularly in the early postpartum period that was considered to be a time for learning to adapt to life with their new baby. Women were more supportive of integrating activity into their daily routine than of participating in family-based exercise activities, which had appeared to be important in the review. Even though most of the DAiSIeS participants had a positive experience of GDM pregnancy and knew about having a healthy lifestyle, many felt that more specific information about lifestyle behaviours in T2DM risk prevention was important (such as what foods would be best for them to eat). This echoes a participant in Lindmark <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. 2010 who said ‘…even if it is old knowledge it is good to hear it once more’ [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The participants tended only to maintain selected elements of their GDM diet, which aimed to minimise spikes of high blood glucose during pregnancy, because they considered it was too extreme to sustain (such as a slight/moderate reduction in carbohydrate intake and strict avoidance of all high glycaemic index foods and high sugar fruit). Educational interventions may therefore support them to learn what things to continue and what not to in order to lose weight and maintain a balanced diet. Of particular note, these changes were anticipated help women maintain healthy lifestyle in the long term.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have reported varying views regarding the best timing for intervention: some suggest during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] while others suggest postpartum [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We concluded that women with GDM should be prepared for more specific follow-up interventions such as those described above during their pregnancy, provided that this is done in a sensitive manner, echoing the findings of Ingstrup <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. regarding the importance of rapport with peer councillors [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In general, any healthcare professional involved in the care of women with GDM can promote a longer-term perspective.</p>

While focusing on their own views towards effective interventions, we based the study design, interview schedule and analysis on recent systematic review evidence meaning that a clear evaluation of suggestions could be elicited.</p>
                <p>The participants were from a mixture of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, although many were more highly educated than the rest of the UK [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nonetheless, the need for postpartum support–therefore the anticipated benefits of interventions–was high in this population, and may be higher in other settings. This may have been influenced by recruitment bias, with more health-conscious women or those in need of particular support more likely to engage in the study. We were also unable to capture the number or any characteristics about the women who were aware of the study (through seeing the posters displayed at GDM clinics or being invited specifically) and chose not to take part. However, the participants’ characteristics were comparable to those of the women attending these clinics [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We did not collect data on BMI or whether participants were overweight because we did not access their medical record, and to ask them to self-report this could be insensitive during the postpartum period. It is important to facilitate all women to maintain a healthy diet and be physically active after GDM, regardless of their BMI, yet we were unable to comment on whether BMI affected requirements for support. Furthermore, social desirability bias may have led some participants to agree with the prompted suggestions, although it was clarified in the question that negative responses would be as informative as positive ones. Finally, as is true for all qualitative research, other interpretations of the data collected in this study might be possible, although no participants disagreed with the summary of the findings that we sent to them.</p>

                <title>Implications for practice</title>
                <p>In this study, the participants were keen to have a healthier diet and increase their physical activity after pregnancy. Importantly, many recognised the dedication and support they would need to sustain changes they had managed during pregnancy. Because intention and self-efficacy, influenced by past experience, have been associated with healthy diet and exercise at one and two years postpartum [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] nurturing these beliefs is imperative. We identified a wide range of more specific requirements that could be addressed through various multi-faceted approaches (<xref rid="pone.0262852.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Our findings support the important role that clinicians play in promoting healthy behaviours and signposting resources during pregnancy and postpartum [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally, we suggest that it would be acceptable for the longer-term implications of GDM to be discussed in an informal manner throughout pregnancy and mentioned while mothers are on the postnatal ward. Many studies have reported pregnancy to be a ‘teachable moment’ for a range of behaviours due to increased motivation and regular contact with health professionals [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As a result, informing women about postpartum recommendations in pregnancy is likely to be beneficial although not an end in itself [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
                <p>The participants also expressed interest in a postpartum follow-up appointment. If the blood test was undertaken in advance, the six-week mother-and-baby healthcheck [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] could be extended to include specific GDM follow-up, such as discussion of future plans for diet and exercise going forward in light of the test result. This would also provide an opportunity to ask specific outstanding questions. Since half of mothers receive inadequate time to discuss their own mental and physical health [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], both the mother and GP should have aligned expectations about this appointment.</p>
                <p>Postpartum contact also provides opportunity for a healthcare professional to signpost mothers to existing resources. Although some DAiSIeS participants preferred to meet other mothers with GDM, many expressed similar experiences and needs as women without GDM, therefore general postpartum dietary information or exercise classes could be beneficial. A recent study of mothers in a similar area identified the need to increase capability for exercise through signposting to suitable mother-and-baby exercise classes (which would be an environment where they felt comfortable about themselves and bringing their baby), and guidance about how to exercise safely after the birth [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
                <p>Like many others, the women in our study reported accessing and interacting with websites, forums, social media and other sources of written information during pregnancy and postpartum. For example, mothers reported accessing Facebook more frequently in the postpartum period [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], such as to connect with other breastfeeding mothers for advice [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Information was accessible at all times and could be informative and supportive, but many users raise doubts about trustworthiness [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0262852.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A recent analysis of posts on Mumsnet and Netmums forums concluded that the support provided does not encourage T2DM prevention because diabetes risk was rarely discussed and users downplayed the seriousness of GDM and its association with lifestyle behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0262852.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Instead of searching for such groups themselves, mothers could be directed to reliable resources by a trusted professional or body.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Many women wanted more support to sustain healthy lifestyles to reduce their T2DM risk after a GDM-affected pregnancy. We identified a broad range of interventions that could offer this support. These mothers thought that additional advice about how to eat healthily and be active when they were busy, and tips for maintaining these changes, would help them most. Many wanted more specific information about their long-term T2DM risk, but they often knew enough about the universal benefits of a healthy lifestyle. This support could be provided throughout pregnancy and postpartum, in a range of formats including face-to-face with healthcare providers or peers and online or physical written information. Directing women to existing trusted resources or groups, or adapting existing interventions to the needs of this population is likely to improve care for mothers after GDM.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. This study aims to conduct a qualitative interview study on the views of women with history of GDM on the need for post-partum support. Given the high prevalence of GDM (affecting 10-20% of all pregnancies in many parts of the world), and the high risk of progressing to T2D after GDM (approximately 7-8x risk compared to non-GDM women), locally-relevant strategies to support women with GDM to reduce progression to T2D are very important. This study provides a systematic assessment of the attitudes and needs of women with GDM, and provide some useful information, in particular towards developing interventions and support networks within the UK healthcare setting and beyond.</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>More reference to the risk of T2DM after GDM might be helpful in the introduction. This may include data from systematic review highlighting the increased risk of T2D afer GDM compared to non-GDM pregnancies.</p>
              <p>Page. 4 Line 82</p>
              <p>It was stated that all women had history of GDM. Please clarify the prevailing diagnostic criteria which would have been used to diagnose GDM in these subjects</p>
              <p>Page 6 Line 135</p>
              <p>It was stated that none of the participants had been diagnosed with T2D. Please clarify if all the women with GDM had undergone postpartum OGTT screening</p>
              <p>Table 1</p>
              <p>Is any information available on the proportion of women who were overweight/obese, or their mean BMI?</p>
              <p>Page 8 Line 151</p>
              <p>Although I understand this is a qualitative interview study, are the authors able to state the number of women who were aware of the link between GDM and T2D, which would significantly affect the interpretation of the results?</p>
              <p>Page 14 Line 246-248</p>
              <p>Please provide further details on the responses from the participants on the preferred format, source and timing of providing support . Are the responses summarized by the later comments on In person peer groups, appointments with healthcare professionals and written messages?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 participants with a history of GDM to explored the views of women on possible interventions to support healthy diet and physical activity to reduce diabetes risk and aimed to identify the most promising interventions for future development. The sample size was small and less representative. I also have some other concerns about the interpretations and discussions.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. The participants were women who were interested in the study topic and the sample size was only 20 women. The representativeness and potential selection bias is one of the major problems of the study.</p>
              <p>2. In table1, “education level” was not defined in methods.</p>
              <p>3. The results of each theme were not concise, and some other interpretations might also possible, which should be discussed in full.</p>
              <p>4. There are some published articles that investigated views of women with prior GDM on about diet and physical activity interventions. A detailed discussion about the similarity and differences and the underlying reasons is warranted.</p>

              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we have decided that your manuscript does not meet our criteria for publication and must therefore be rejected.</p>
              <p>I am sorry that we cannot be more positive on this occasion, but hope that you appreciate the reasons for this decision.</p>

              <p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided)</p>
              <p>Thank you for the submission to Plos One. Given the reviewers comment and the small number of highly selected participants on a qualitative review, the manuscript is not considered to be suitable for publication in Plos One.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE:</p>
              <p>Thank you for considering our manuscript. We would also like to thank the reviewers for their time and feedback on our study.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 1 reported that the manuscript is technically sound and had six suggestions for improving it. These points are simple for us to address.</p>
              <p>The decision to reject the manuscript appears to be based on Reviewer 2’s feedback – primarily ‘the small number of highly selected participants on a qualitative’ study, therefore concerns over representativeness and potential selection bias. We would like to briefly raise the following points:</p>
              <p>1. In qualitative research, we are not interested in generalisability but understanding a phenomenon of interest in depth [1] – in this case, this group of women with a history of GDM’s views on support for postpartum behaviour change.</p>
              <p>2. We planned the sample size using the concept of information power [2], which we have added to the Methods of the manuscript (lines 87-90 of the highlighted manuscript): “We planned to interview approximately 20 women in order to reach data saturation, based on the relatively low information power anticipated [2]. This was because this study had a broad aim, sparse sample specificity but used purposive sampling and was a cross-case analysis. The interviews were structured around pre-defined recommendations.” As explained in the manuscript, we stopped interviewing when the data collection process no longer offers any new or relevant data (data saturation) [3].</p>
              <p>3. Our sample size of 20 participants is larger than many semi-structured interview studies. For example, the qualitative systematic review that informed this interview study included 12 studies using face-to-face interviews [4]. Only three of those had a sample size &gt;20 participants (23, 23 and 35 participants) and median sample size was 16 participants. PLoS ONE has also published several qualitative interview studies with a comparable number of participants in recent months (e.g. [5,6]). </p>

              <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Partly</p>
              <p>________________________________________</p>
              <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Note, there is no quantitative/statistical analysis in this qualitative study.</p>
              <p>________________________________________</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Note, the data underlying the findings of this study are interview transcripts. We have ethical approval and consent from participants to share the pseudo-anonymised transcripts with researchers upon their request to us directly, but not to make them publicly available. </p>
              <p>As suggested in the PLoS ONE Editorial policies for availability of qualitative data, we have made excerpts of the transcripts available within the paper and upon request.</p>
              <p>We will include a data availability statement such as that of Backhausen et al. or Fleming et al. [5,6] (qualitative studies published in PLoS ONE in 2021).</p>
              <p>________________________________________</p>
              <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

              <p>***</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. This study aims to conduct a qualitative interview study on the views of women with history of GDM on the need for post-partum support. Given the high prevalence of GDM (affecting 10-20% of all pregnancies in many parts of the world), and the high risk of progressing to T2D after GDM (approximately 7-8x risk compared to non-GDM women), locally-relevant strategies to support women with GDM to reduce progression to T2D are very important. This study provides a systematic assessment of the attitudes and needs of women with GDM, and provide some useful information, in particular towards developing interventions and support networks within the UK healthcare setting and beyond.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for reviewing our paper and for reinforcing the importance of these findings for intervention development. </p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>More reference to the risk of T2DM after GDM might be helpful in the introduction. This may include data from systematic review highlighting the increased risk of T2D after GDM compared to non-GDM pregnancies.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have expanded the description of T2D risk after GDM with data from recent systematic reviews including absolute risk data, relative risk data and factors associated with higher rates of progression: “GDM is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications in both mother and baby, and maternal cardiometabolic disorders in later life [7]. Approximately a third of women with GDM are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) by 15 years postpartum, with recent data suggesting that the increased risk is sustained over time since GDM rather than being limited to the first few years after delivery [8]. T2D risk factors including high body mass index (BMI) and ethnicity further increase T2D risk in women who have had GDM: development of T2D is 18% (5–34%) higher per unit BMI at follow-up, and 57% (39–70%) lower in White European populations compared to other populations (adjusting for ethnicity and follow-up) [8]. Factors such as poorer pregnancy glucose tolerance requiring treatment with insulin have been found to further increase risk [9]. Overall, women who had GDM are 7–10 times more likely to develop T2D over their lifetime than women with normoglycaemic pregnancies [8,10,11].” (lines 48-59).</p>
              <p>Page. 4 Line 82</p>
              <p>It was stated that all women had history of GDM. Please clarify the prevailing diagnostic criteria which would have been used to diagnose GDM in these subjects.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We have expanded this section to describe the NICE guidelines for diagnosing GDM at this time, plus some details on GDM management (lines 98-109): “NICE recommends screening for GDM with a 75g 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in women with one or more risk factors (BMI greater than 30 kg/m2, previous baby weighing 4.5 kg or more, previous pregnancy affected by GDM, family history of diabetes, and ethnicity with a high prevalence of diabetes) [12]. Diagnostic cut-offs were defined according to local protocols: at Peterborough Hospital, those with a fasting value ≥5.6 mmol/l or 2 hour value of ≥7.8 mmol/l were diagnosed with GDM (NICE guidelines); at the Rosie Hospital, those with a fasting value ≥5.1 mmol/l, 1 hour value of ≥10.0 mmol/l or 2 hour value of ≥8.5 mmol/l were diagnosed with GDM (International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria [13]). Screening usually takes place at 24 to 28 weeks gestation, although can be repeated if the clinicians suspect GDM has developed. Following GDM diagnosis, women are closely managed with the aim of reducing glycaemia. This involves blood glucose monitoring, diet and exercise, and sometimes insulin and metformin medication.”)</p>
              <p>Page 6 Line 135</p>
              <p>It was stated that none of the participants had been diagnosed with T2D. Please clarify if all the women with GDM had undergone postpartum OGTT screening.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for raising this point – none of the participants had been diagnosed but not all have been screened for diabetes. We have revised this to read “None of the 16 participants who had had a diabetes screening test since pregnancy had been diagnosed with T2D.” (lines 158-159).</p>
              <p>Table 1</p>
              <p>Is any information available on the proportion of women who were overweight/obese, or their mean BMI?</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: This is a valid point to raise, given the association between postpartum BMI and diabetes risk explained in the introduction. However, we did not collect this data since we did not access patients’ medical records and did not ask them to self-report BMI in the demographics questionnaire at the end of the interview. We considered that this would be an insensitive question to ask in the context of this interview and during the postpartum period, following a pregnancy where many women are particularly sensitive about weight (some participants noted the stigma associated with GDM, particularly for overweight women, and how this could lead them to disengage with healthcare/behaviour change).</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it is important for all women to maintain a healthy diet and be physically active after GDM, regardless of their weight/BMI.</p>
              <p>We have commented on this in the Strengths and Limitations section in order to bring it to the readers’ attention: “We did not collect data on BMI or whether participants were overweight because we did not access their medical record, and to ask them to self-report this could be insensitive during the postpartum period. It is important for all women to maintain a healthy diet and be physically active after GDM, regardless of their BMI, yet we were unable to comment on whether BMI affected requirements for support.” (lines 353-357).</p>
              <p>Page 8 Line 151</p>
              <p>Although I understand this is a qualitative interview study, are the authors able to state the number of women who were aware of the link between GDM and T2D, which would significantly affect the interpretation of the results?</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Sixteen of the 20 participants were clearly aware of the association between GDM and T2D. Two participants were not aware of the association and two participants seemed to be inconsistent across their interviews.</p>
              <p>We have added this information to this paragraph (lines 173-177), stating, “The remaining participants reported sentiments such as “I don’t feel like I've been given the help that I think there should be really out there” [Participant 1, attempting healthier postpartum lifestyle but felt unsupported overall], “post-GDM support would be really good for mothers” [P2, healthier, unsupported] and two participants explained that they had been unaware of an association between GDM and T2D.”</p>
              <p>It is also worth noting that the interview was consistently framed in the context of preventing T2D in women who had had GDM (e.g. this was the first sentence of the participant information sheet and explained in the introduction to the interview). We suggested that the participants seek advice from their GP if they had questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>Page 14 Line 246-248</p>
              <p>Please provide further details on the responses from the participants on the preferred format, source and timing of providing support. Are the responses summarized by the later comments on In person peer groups, appointments with healthcare professionals and written messages?</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Yes, the participants’ responses on the preferred format, source and timing of support are reported in the section “Delivery of support or interventions” (lines 271-311). We have clarified this by saying “This included the preferred format (including in-person peer support groups, appointments with healthcare professionals and written information), source and timing.” (lines 272-274).</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 participants with a history of GDM to explored the views of women on possible interventions to support healthy diet and physical activity to reduce diabetes risk and aimed to identify the most promising interventions for future development. The sample size was small and less representative. I also have some other concerns about the interpretations and discussions.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. The participants were women who were interested in the study topic and the sample size was only 20 women. The representativeness and potential selection bias is one of the major problems of the study.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: As we describe in our response to the editorial comments above, we would like to respond with the following brief points:</p>
              <p>1. In qualitative research, we are not interested in generalisability but understanding a phenomenon of interest in depth [1] – in this case, this group of women with a history of GDM’s views on support for postpartum behaviour change.</p>
              <p>2. We planned the sample size using the concept of information power [2], which we have added to the Methods of the manuscript (lines 87-90): “We planned to interview approximately 20 women in order to reach data saturation, based on the relatively low information power anticipated [2]. This was because this study had a broad aim, sparse sample specificity but used purposive sampling and was a cross-case analysis. The interviews were structured around pre-defined recommendations.” As explained in the manuscript, we stopped interviewing when ‘the data collection process no longer offers any new or relevant data’ (data saturation) [3].</p>
              <p>3. Our sample size of 20 participants is larger than many semi-structured interview studies. For example, the qualitative systematic review that informed this interview study included 12 studies using face-to-face interviews [4]. Only three of those had a sample size &gt;20 participants (23, 23 and 35 participants) and median sample size was 16 participants. PLoS ONE has also published several qualitative interview studies with a comparable number of participants in recent months (e.g. [5,6]).</p>
              <p>In addition, recruiting participants who are interested in the study is a universal source of bias in every research study. We have already commented on this in the Strengths and Limitations section: “This [the need for postpartum support] may have been influenced by recruitment bias, with more health-conscious women or those in need of particular support more likely to engage in the study.” (lines 352-353).</p>
              <p>2. In table1, “education level” was not defined in methods.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: The different education levels reported in Table 1 are universal terms to describe education in the UK. Nevertheless, we will include examples of qualifications gained at these levels in Table 1 (under line 162): </p>
              <p>• Secondary or further (GCSEs, A levels, BTEC, apprenticeships or equivalent)</p>
              <p>• Higher (Bachelor’s degree or equivalent)</p>
              <p>• Postgraduate (Master’s degree, PhD or equivalent)</p>
              <p>3. The results of each theme were not concise, and some other interpretations might also possible, which should be discussed in full.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We are not clear from this comment which of the Results are not concise. Each of the themes is summarised in one to three short paragraphs, with a total word count that is shorter than many quantitative papers.</p>
              <p>As is true for all qualitative research, we acknowledge that other interpretations of these data might also be possible, and have acknowledged this in the Strengths and Limitations section by concluding with “Finally, as is true for all qualitative research, other interpretations of the data collected in this study might be possible, although no participants disagreed with the summary of the findings that we sent to them.” (lines 360-362). We came to these conclusions as a multidisciplinary team with expertise in qualitative research, GDM healthcare and primary care after being immersed in the interview data. We have tried to be as transparent as possible in presenting the findings, exploring deviant cases and presenting evidence (e.g. quotations) so that the reader is able to draw their own conclusions. We have also added the coding frame to the supporting information to increase transparency (line 146: “The final codebook for the framework is reported in S2 Table.”).</p>
              <p>There must always be a balance between being concise and reporting in enough detail to explain how we came to these interpretations.</p>
              <p>4. There are some published articles that investigated views of women with prior GDM on about diet and physical activity interventions. A detailed discussion about the similarity and differences and the underlying reasons is warranted.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: In lines 321-332, we compared the findings of this study to our recent systematic review on women’s views towards having a healthy diet and physical activity after GDM (similarities, differences and underlying reasons) [4]. This review includes intervention studies as well as those investigating barriers and facilitators to the behaviours (e.g. Nicklas et al. 2011, O’Dea et al. 2015). We have expanded and clarified this section to read: “… We found that influences on healthy diet and exercise were similar between the review and this interview study, such as spending time with children instead of exercising and how the family could facilitate healthy behaviours. Lack of time and energy were particularly evident in the early postpartum period in this interview study, which was considered to be a time for learning to adapt to life with their new baby. Women were more supportive of integrating activity into their daily routine than of participating in family-based exercise activities, which appeared to be important in the review. …”</p>
              <p>Additionally, in lines 333-343, we compared our findings on timing of the intervention to those of previous studies related to this topic. We have added reference to Ingstrup et al. 2019 (nine women’s experience with peer counselling and social support during a lifestyle intervention among women with previous GDM), which highlighted that rapport was important for social support to be effective: “We concluded that women with GDM should be prepared for more specific follow-up interventions during their pregnancy, provided that this is done in a sensitive manner, echoing the findings of Ingstrup et al. regarding the importance of rapport with peer councillors [14].” (lines 339-342).</p>
              <p>We would be happy to add any other recent papers the reviewer is aware of. </p>

              <p>The study aims to explore women’s views on suggested practical approaches to achieve and maintain a healthy diet and physical activity to reduce T2D risk. Please consider the following comments to improve the manuscript.</p>
              <p>1. Abstract</p>
              <p>Line 33 – Line 35: Suggest to include the percentages of “a third” participants for “transformative”, “beneficial” and “did not want additional support”.</p>
              <p>Line 35: Suggest to put the percentage after “the majority”.</p>
              <p>Line 38: Suggest to put the percentage after “four”.</p>
              <p>2. Introduction</p>
              <p>Line 55 - Line 56: Since you mentioned “These sites were chosen to provide socioeconomic and ethnic diversity, and represent views from those attending both secondary and tertiary centres offering GDM/ and obstetric care” in line 80 to line 81 (page 4), hence, it is better to specify the prevalence of GDM of different ethnicities (Chinese, Indian, Japanese) instead of putting “as compare to other populations”.</p>
              <p>Line 57: Please specify the type of risk for “glucose tolerance requiring treatment with insulin have been found to further increase risk”. It this refer to GDM risk or T2D risk?</p>
              <p>Line 64: Please specify the activities of behaviour change intervention. For example, the type of intervention done by previous researchers to give a better picture for the readers. Support your sentence with reference.</p>
              <p>Line 65: Please specify the type of population. Is this referring to women with GDM history or without GDM history? Because GDM history may influence the effectiveness of the behavioural change intervention.</p>
              <p>Line 66 - Line 67: Please provide a reference for “we found that women who had had GDM identified themselves primarily as mothers who prioritised their family above themselves”.</p>
              <p>Line 71: Considering a small sample size in the present study, please provide the sample size for Reference 13 and Reference 14. This is to give an overall picture for the readers to understand the common sample size being used in qualitative research.</p>
              <p>Line 71: Please provide brief details for Reference 13 and Reference 14. What are the previous activities conducted by the researchers?</p>
              <p>Line 72: Please mention the research gap before your study adjective.</p>
              <p>Line 74: Is this objective “We aimed to identify the most promising interventions for future development” reflect in your findings? If not, please remove this sentence.</p>
              <p>3. Recruitment</p>
              <p>Line 86: Please provide the response rate of this study. Out of the total contacted participants, how many of them agreed or rejected to participate in the present study.</p>
              <p>Line 87 – Line 89: These sentences are not strong enough to support your final sample size (n=20). Since you mentioned “to reach data saturation”, have you conducted data saturation assessment in your study? Please explain how you assess the data saturation.</p>
              <p>Line 88 – Line 89: What do you mean by “this study had a broad aim sparse sample specificity but used purposive sampling and was a cross-case analysis”? This sentence is unclear and needs further improvement.</p>
              <p>Line 90: What do you mean by “the interviews were structured around pre-defined recommendation”? Please provide more details and also a reference for this statement.</p>
              <p>Line 90 - Line 91: Is Reference 16 correctly cited?</p>
              <p>Line 91 – Line 92: How many participants you have interviewed in your study? Do you include data of all participants that have completed the interview or only part of them? Please provide the response rate.</p>
              <p>4. Inclusion criteria</p>
              <p>Line 98: Do you conduct GDM screening in your study? Or do you obtain GDM data from the participants’ medical history?</p>
              <p>Line 110 – Line 113: Please mentioned how many women you have excluded from the study.</p>
              <p>5. Interview process</p>
              <p>Do you conduct any pre-test prior to the interview? Modification of interview guide and suggestion cards are required before you conduct the actual interview. If yes, how many attended the pre-test and what modifications you have done?</p>
              <p>Line 122 - Line 123: Based on Table S2, it seems like No 11 to 20 in Table S1 are not including in your study. Please clarify the number of suggestion cards in your study. Please mention how many suggestion cards you have included in the final version.</p>
              <p>Line 132: Please elaborate type of format for “what format might be most effective”.</p>
              <p>Line 133: Please mention how many suggestion cards you have shown to your participants.</p>
              <p>Line 137: “These questions were then repeated for attending diabetes screening (reported separately)”: When did you conduct the diabetes screening?

              <p>The authors have not clearly stated how the themes emerged. They have used a card which is pre-specified and may not explore the phenomenon very well</p>
              <p>The quotations used in your manuscript contain potentially identifying information. Please amend your manuscript by either limiting the amount of potentially-identifying information presented, or by obtaining explicit consent to publish such information. To limit the identifying information, please remove the ages and occupation information from your quotes to help maintain participant confidentiality. Please use age ranges in place of the ages. Please check that the identifiers do not link to participants.</p>
              <p>As far as qualitative research is concerned, descripting in number is not recommended. How ever, the authors stated state</p>
              <p>the number of women who were aware of the link between GDM and T2D, which would significantly affect the interpretation of the results.</p>
              <p>Generally, the title is of interest and current issue.</p>
              <p>The paper can be accepted for publication after modification.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr Farrar</p>
              <p>Thank you for considering our manuscript and for the opportunity to resubmit it. We would also like to thank the reviewers for their time and feedback on our study.</p>
              <p>We have addressed the outstanding points (Review Comments to the Author) as follows:</p>
              <p>&gt; Reviewer #4: Previous comments were addressed by the authors. Please confirm the distribution of respondents under the maternity leave in Table 1 is correctly presented as the current sample size is less than 20. The paper is ready to be accepted after minor modification.</p>
              <p>&gt; RESPONSE: The distribution of respondents on maternity leave in Table 1 is correct. One participant was a ‘home parent’ therefore they cannot be on maternity leave from formal employment. We have added ‘NA’ in order to clarify this, with the changes highlighted.</p>
              <p>&gt; Reviewer #5: I appreciate the authors’ efforts. This revised draft addresses all of my concerns. So I don't have any more comments or questions.</p>
              <p>There were no other comments, and all of the references are complete and correct.</p>
              <p>We look forward to hearing from you and hope that this manuscript can be accepted for publication in PLoS ONE.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
              <p>Rebecca Dennison, Simon Griffin, Juliet Usher-Smith, Rachel Fox, Catherine Aiken and Claire Meek</p>
