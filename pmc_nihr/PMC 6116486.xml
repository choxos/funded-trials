                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Despite effective treatments and long-standing management guidelines, there are approximately 1400 hospital admissions for asthma weekly in the United Kingdom (UK), many of which could be avoided. In our previous research, a secondary analysis of the intervention (ARRISA) suggested an improvement in the management of at-risk asthma patients in primary care. ARRISA involved identifying individuals at risk of adverse asthma events, flagging their electronic health records, training practice staff to develop and implement practice-wide processes of care when alerted by the flag, plus motivational reminders. We now seek to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ARRISA in reducing asthma-related crisis events.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We are undertaking a pragmatic, two-arm, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial, plus health economic and process evaluation. We will randomise 270 primary care practices from throughout the UK covering over 10,000 registered patients with ‘at-risk asthma’ identified according to a validated algorithm. Staff in practices randomised to the intervention will complete two 45-min eLearning modules (an individually completed module giving background to ARRISA and a group-completed module to develop practice-wide pathways of care) plus a 30-min webinar with other practices. On completion of training at-risk patients’ records will be coded so that a flag appears whenever their record is accessed. Practices will receive a phone call at 4 weeks and a reminder video at 6 weeks and 6 months. Control practices will continue to provide usual care. We will extract anonymised routine patient data from primary care records (with linkage to secondary care data) to determine the percentage of at-risk patients with an asthma-related crisis event (accident and emergency attendances, hospitalisations and deaths) after 12 months (primary outcome). We will also capture the time to crisis event, all-cause hospitalisations, asthma control and any changes in practice asthma management for at-risk and all patients with asthma. Cost-effectiveness analysis and mixed-methods process evaluations will also be conducted.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study is novel in terms of using a practice-wide intervention to target and engage with patients at risk from their asthma and is innovative in the use of routinely captured data with record linkage to obtain trial outcomes.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par49">Worldwide, asthma affects 334 million people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the UK, which has one of the highest prevalence rates in Europe, there are 5.4 million patients with asthma, and asthma affects one in five households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A quarter of all asthma patients have poor symptom control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and 185 people are admitted to hospital because of asthma attacks every day in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Asthma attacks result in major social, psychological and healthcare costs. For example, attacks are associated with a doubling of the healthcare costs for managing severe asthma in both children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Asthma is, therefore, a common condition which results in a large, unnecessary personal, healthcare and economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Worryingly, given that there are an increasing number of effective treatments and long-standing, evidence-based management guidelines for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the death rate for asthma has not reduced over recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par50">It is widely accepted that the majority of deaths and hospital admissions from asthma are associated with preventable factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2012, this prompted a National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which showed that poor access to care and poor adherence with preventive medication(s) were key contributors in the deaths of a large proportion of patients. Patient-assessed poor access to primary care is also associated with emergency hospital admissions for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, due to complicating clinical and psychosocial characteristics, patients with asthma who are at particular risk of attacks (at-risk asthma) often fail to attend routine appointments or engage in initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], such as self-management education, that improve outcomes in general asthma populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, these patients characteristically under-use primary care services, often fail to attend scheduled appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and have difficulty adhering to treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is these same patient groups that are also most often excluded from clinical trials. Existing evidence is thus unlikely to be generalisable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and research is urgently needed to identify better management strategies for this group. Systematic nationwide training and implementation programmes, mostly based in primary care, are able to reduce the morbidity and impact of asthma with reduced costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Also, a clinical care pathway for children with asthma has been shown to modify practice behaviour and reduce emergency department attendance and hospitalisations, but not significantly so, compared to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Indeed, the current British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (BTS/SIGN) British guideline on the management of asthma notes that ‘<italic>well-conducted studies are needed to define the benefits of care pathways for asthma. These should include large, suitably powered studies to clarify the impact of pathways promoting systematic management of people with high-risk asthma in UK primary care’.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par51">In an observational pilot study at a single primary care practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], electronic flagging of the electronic health records (EHRs) of 26 patients, demonstrating characteristics previously associated with adverse asthma outcomes, and training all practice staff in appropriate actions to take on seeing the flag was associated with a reduction in the number of emergency events for asthma in these individuals over 1 year, compared to 26 age-, sex- and treatment-matched controls. Our subsequent regional cluster randomised trial involving 29 primary care practices in Norfolk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] covering 911 people at a high-risk of experiencing asthma crisis events (at-risk asthma, defined in line with contemporaneous guidelines as severe asthma plus adverse psychosocial factors) similarly flagged patients’ EHRs and delivered a 1-h practice-based training session for practice staff. The intervention did not reduce the primary composite endpoint of asthma attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] over 1 year. However, increases in the number of prescriptions of prednisolone (31% (95% confidence interval (CI) − 8 to 85)) masked reductions in the percentage of hospitalisations (50% (95% CI 6 to 74)) and accident and emergency (A&amp;E) attendances (26% (95% CI − 31 to 58) amongst patients in intervention versus control practices. The intervention was well received by practice staff (according to an exit questionnaire) and resulted in an estimated cost-saving of £138.21 (95% CI £1248 to − £910) per patient in the intervention arm.</p>
              <p id="Par52">This regional study suggested that our primary care intervention for at-risk asthma patients (ARRISA) may have potential as a strategy for improving practice-level management and reducing emergency admissions, near-fatal asthma and asthma deaths, in this group. However, it remains to be seen whether these findings would translate into a meaningful clinical benefit at a larger scale. Furthermore, the identification of at-risk individuals in the previous studies was achieved by manually searching records to provide evidence of adverse psychosocial factors and the training was undertaken via a face-to-face, practice-based group discussion led by an experienced facilitator. These features of the intervention would be difficult to roll out nationally so we modified these processes in our current study: individuals with at-risk asthma will be automatically identified using a computer code containing details of an algorithm based on data routinely available in primary care EHRs and the training will be delivered via an online eLearning platform and webinars. Furthermore, in contrast to the original study where outcome data were obtained by semi-manually searching the primary care EHRs, in the current study we will utilise anonymous data extraction and record linkage of primary and secondary care records.</p>
              <p id="Par53">The study aims to test the hypothesis that systematically identifying patients at risk of severe exacerbations of asthma, flagging their primary care EHR to provide enduring prompts at the time of contacts with the practice, training all practice staff about the systematic management of these patients and providing on-going practice support (hereafter referred to as creation and integration of a primary care at-risk asthma register) will reduce crisis asthma events (asthma-related deaths, hospitalisations and A&amp;E attendances) for at-risk patients and be clinically acceptable and cost-effective without detriment to the care of non-at-risk asthma patients.</p>
              <p id="Par54">Our intervention operates at the practice level. A cluster randomised trial design is, therefore, appropriate with the general practice as the unit of randomisation. As such, although the majority of objectives (including primary endpoint) and the health economic analysis pertain to the participant level, some objectives pertain to the cluster level (including aspects of the process evaluation). The study will be conducted in a controlled open study with blind assessment. The comparator will be usual care as defined by the current BTS/SIGN British Asthma Guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par55">The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the creation and integration of at-risk asthma registers into primary care, as conceptualised in our ’At-Risk Registers Integrated into primary care to Stop Asthma crises’ (ARRISA) intervention, reduces asthma-related crisis events (A&amp;E attendances, hospitalisations and deaths) for <italic>at-risk patients</italic> over a 12-month period compared to control practices. Our secondary aims are to assess outcomes (time to first crisis event, asthma control, all-cause admission or death) for <italic>all</italic> patients with asthma; and also to examine changes in the processes of asthma care (treatments, vaccinations, use of action plans or smoking cessation services, adherence to treatment) within practices. We also aim to assess whether this intervention is acceptable to healthcare professionals and patients and cost-effective from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). We will identify characteristics that influence uptake, integration and effectiveness of the intervention and explore causal mechanisms leading to changes in outcomes, including any unanticipated effects.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par56">This is a two-arm, pragmatic, multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial plus health economic and process evaluation comparing usual care (control) to a complex, primary care practice-level intervention comprising: (1) creation of an asthma at-risk register, (2) online eLearning training for practice staff, (3) Computerised Decision Support System (CDSS) involving flagging of at-risk patients’ records to prompt agreed actions and (4) ongoing practice support. The intervention targets all healthcare professionals and reception staff within practices. The trial outline is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and the schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The trial protocol (v1.3, dated 23 March 2018) is based on the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 Statement for protocols of clinical trials (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>ARRISA-UK trial outline</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2816_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>ARRISA-UK schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2816_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par57">Routinely available data from patient records on outcomes, processes of care and healthcare use will be captured anonymously, without the involvement of the practice, at the end of the 12-month study period. Additional resource use data, for the purposes of economic evaluation, will be captured during the online training, post training and 12-month questionnaires. Data from a baseline practice demographic survey, the training software, questionnaires completed post training and at 12 months, plus focus groups and individual interviews undertaken with a sub-sample of practice staff and patients towards the end of the study, including those from the whole asthma population and those with at-risk asthma in the intervention and control groups (see below), will contribute to the process evaluation. This will take a mixed-methods sequential explanatory approach to exploring implementation, mechanisms and contextual influences on the intervention.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par69">This is a practice-wide (cluster-level) complex intervention comprising four main components:</p>
                <p id="Par70">1. Establishment of a practice at-risk asthma register:</p>
                <p id="Par71">We have developed and validated an algorithm, using routinely collected primary care data, for identifying those patients most at risk of attending A&amp;E, being admitted to hospital or dying from an asthma attack. Factors in the algorithm include previous exacerbation history, coding for anxiety or depression, smoking history and prescribing data and laboratory results. Automated electronic searches identify patients with at-risk asthma from practice-based data using this algorithm. This is a two-stage process with the initial generation of an anonymised list and then coding to provide the names and details of the patients. Programmes and instructions for searches, with frequently asked questions, for the specific computer software programme of each practice will be sent to the information technology (IT) lead at the practice by email or compact disc (CD).</p>
                <p id="Par72">A representative (usually asthma GP lead or asthma nurse) at each intervention practice receives a document by email which explains ‘at-risk asthma’ and gives instructions on how to modify the list of patients with their records flagged (see CDSS below). GPs and asthma nurses are able to review the computer-generated list of at-risk patients, and exceptionally, with documented justification of the change, delete any who should not be on the list (e.g. receiving palliative care) and identify any other ‘at-risk’ patients known to them. They may modify the list, as above, for the duration of the study although the primary analysis will be based on data from patients included in the original register prior to modifications</p>
                <p id="Par73">2.  Practice-wide, online training (eLearning)</p>
                <p id="Par74">We have developed an innovative multi-component practice-wide intervention based on the material delivered in the face-to-face training developed for the prior regional study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], but incorporating eLearning modules similar to those that have been previously shown to be successful in changing clinician behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Each practice is asked to nominate a representative from each staff discipline, e.g. nurse, GP, pharmacist (in dispensing practices) and receptionist (referred to collectively hereafter as ‘practice representatives’). A dedicated member of the practice staff (generally the practice asthma nurse) is then charged with championing the intervention at the practice (referred to hereafter as the practice champion) and ensuring dissemination via the practice representatives to maximise uptake. Practice representatives receive a document describing the purpose of the training and providing log-in details to the eLearning training resource. The eLearning modules have been developed in conjunction with Healthcare-Learning (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthcare-learning.com">www.healthcare-learning.com</ext-link>). They are hosted on the HealthCare-Learning secure website with links from the Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aukcar.ac.uk">www.aukcar.ac.uk</ext-link>). The main purpose of the education is to advise all practice staff on actions to take when presented with the electronic flag (see CDSS below) on the EHRs of an at-risk patient. It comprises two eLearning modules and a webinar:</p>
                <p id="Par75">(a) An individually completed module</p>
                <p id="Par76">This provides information on the national and patient perspectives of managing at-risk asthma, NRAD results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], findings from the studies that were precursors to the ARRISA-UK study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the flags to be added to patient records and discipline-specific training as to suggested actions to be undertaken on seeing the flag. The training uses a case scenario to highlight the possible benefits of the intervention and self-assessments to permit active learning and self-reflection. This module is to be undertaken by the practice champion and representatives and takes up to 45 min to complete.</p>
                <p id="Par77">(b) A practice-representative team completed module</p>
                <p id="Par78">This module is organised and chaired by the practice champion and attended by all of the practice representatives. The purpose of this module is to permit representatives of the practice team to collectively reflect on the material contained in the first module and encourage practice staff to agree on and document how the intervention will be implemented in their practice via a practice ‘action plan’. This covers the wording of the flag, proposed actions of each staff discipline in response to the flag, plans for including information in staff induction and disseminating to all staff, stance on informing patients about their at-risk status and a method for communicating with out-of-hours services. This module takes up to 45 min to complete</p>
                <p id="Par79">(c) A webinar</p>
                <p id="Par80">Ideally, within 8 weeks of completion of the second module, the practice representatives are asked to dial into a 30-min ‘webinar’ (online discussion) which reviews the learning objectives and outcome from the modules. It permits discussion within and between practices (in groups of between two and eight practices) participating in the study, allowing them to share experiences and ideas, and refine their practice implementation and dissemination plans accordingly. The webinars are being delivered by the GP lead who originally implemented an at-risk asthma register at his practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], developed and led the face-to-face training in the prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and was involved in developing the eLearning modules</p>
                <p id="Par81">3. CDSS</p>
                <p id="Par82">The CDSS consists of a flag which appears on the EHR whenever a patient on the at-risk asthma register makes contact with any member of the practice team and the clinical record is opened, and is designed to prompt actions as per the practice’s ‘action plan’ (see above). The nature of the flag is dependent on the software used to manage the practice’s EHRs and varies between pop-ups that actively need clearing from screen to yellow Post-it style notes remaining on screen. ARRISA is compatible with the Vision (In Practice Systems Ltd., London, UK), EMIS (EMIS Health, Leeds, UK) and SystmOne (The Phoenix Partnership (TPP), Leeds, UK) EHRs which account for more than 90% of primary care practices in the UK. The wording of the flag is chosen by the practice during the second training module but suggested wording of ‘At-Risk Asthma Prioritise Care’ is given. Instructions for generating the flag are provided to the practice manager/IT lead. The flagging goes live after the completion of the minimum training as defined below</p>
                <p id="Par83">4. Practice support</p>
                <p id="Par84">The practice champion receives a phone call approximately 4 weeks (between 2 and 6 weeks) after the activation of the flags to ensure that there are no technical or other fundamental implementation issues. Practice representatives receive emails containing links to brief videos at 6 weeks and 6 months that remind practices of the purpose of the study and the importance of targeting, prioritising access for, engaging with, and effectively managing, patients with at-risk asthma at every opportunity.</p>
                <p id="Par85">Study newsletters will be circulated to practice representatives for the duration of the study. These provide updates on study progress including number of recruited sites, timelines, etc. In addition, practice staff have access to a helpline manned by an un-blinded IT technician for help with technical issues regarding the software for the duration of the study. The eLearning website contains links to national guidelines and other resources.</p>
                <p id="Par86">Full practice engagement with the training is encouraged as the flag is only activated after the completion of minimum training, which we define as at least one practice member completing both eLearning training modules. If required, we will send reminders to all practice representatives by email on two occasions then contact them by phone to encourage completion of the training. Assessment of engagement with the intervention will form part of the process evaluation and include examination of modifications to the register, uptake and completion of the training and engagement with follow-up phone calls.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec16">
                <title>Control</title>
                <p id="Par87">Control practices produce an anonymised list of patients who meet the definition of at-risk asthma from the algorithm. They are given instructions and asked to enter a research-relevant Read code onto patients’ EHRs so that they can be identified for the purpose of data collection. However, practice staff are blind to the names and details of the patients on the list until the end of the study. The practice representatives from the control practices will also receive study newsletters for the duration of the study.</p>
                <p id="Par88">The control practices continue to provide their usual care. This may vary between practices, but reflects the recommendations of the BTS/SIGN British Asthma Guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and NICE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Primary care practices in England and Wales are incentivised to provide care to BTS/SIGN standards as defined by the Quality and Outcome Framework (QOF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This recommends creating a register of all patients with asthma and offering at least annual practice-based asthma reviews (typically in nurse-led clinics). Recognised management includes checking control of asthma symptoms with the Royal College of Physicians’ three questions (RCP3Qs; i.e. difficulty sleeping, daytime symptoms, interference with usual activities), checking smoking status and offering cessation advice, assessing/teaching inhaler technique, assessing and offering advice on adherence, and delivering patient self-management education which may include provision of action plans and self-monitoring tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Follow-up in secondary care outpatient clinics and use of emergency primary and care services is available as usual for patients, if required.</p>
                <p id="Par89">After completion of the trial, control practice staff will be permitted to undertake the eLearning training and un-blind and modify the register in the same way as intervention practices could at the beginning of the study.</p>

                  <p id="Par112">All participating practices must agree to share their practice EHRs with Optimum Patient Care (Cambridge, UK). Obtaining data in this way not only permits linkage to different databases (practice EHRs, Office for National Statistics (ONS), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)), but also permits data capture without burdening the practice or patients. All practices (control and intervention) are asked to insert a specific Read code that cannot be readily removed by practice staff into the EHRs of at-risk asthma patients to denote inclusion in this study. This will be used by data managers and statisticians to identify these patients and distinguish their data from other patients with active asthma in the practice. For the purposes of data collection, active asthma is defined using the QOF criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]: Read code for asthma diagnosis plus asthma therapy in the past year, excluding those coded as asthma resolved but not excluding QOF exception codes. At the end of the study, data extractions will be obtained for all patients with asthma in the practice containing data for the 12 months before randomisation and the 12 months following the activation of the flag in the intervention practices. The mean time from randomisation to activation of the flag will be calculated for all intervention practices, and data collection will be captured for 12 months from this time after randomisation in the control practices. For clinical event data and for patients’ demographic and other characteristics (weight, height, smoking status, etc.) the last recorded value will be obtained.</p>

Likewise, data collected from the helplines and phone calls to practices conducted between 2 and 6 weeks capture details of problems with the intervention and practice engagement. During the second training module, practice teams will be asked to complete online action plans, and these will be captured along with notes from the webinar facilitator, and recordings of webinars to assess details of, and variation in, practice-level dissemination and implementation of the intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par115">After the training, all practice representatives from intervention practices are asked to complete an online questionnaire to provide feedback regarding their experiences and the perceived impact of the training and flags.

At the end of the study all practice representatives from the intervention practices will be asked to complete a further online questionnaire to provide information regarding their experience of the intervention and its integration into routine practice.

It is anticipated that dual moderator focus groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or interviews, will be undertaken with representatives from at least six practice/staff group teams (approximately eight participants per focus group) across several study regions. Practice staff and patients at participating practices will be identified and approached via the practice champion. Both patients and practice staff will be consented by process evaluation researchers prior to being involved in focus groups and/or qualitative interviews. A maximum diversity sample of participants will be recruited to reflect a range of engagement with the intervention/training and practice and staff characteristics, guided by quantitative data if this identifies issues for particular staff groups or types of practice. Each focus group will last approximately 1 h and will be digitally audio-recorded, then transcribed verbatim. A further three focus groups, using the same methodology, will be undertaken with patients from three of the practices represented in staff focus groups. The purpose of these focus groups will be to explore patients’ experiences and perspectives on the strengths and limitations of ‘at-risk’ registers and their potential for impact on patients’ asthma management. Fewer focus groups and interviews will be undertaken if data saturation becomes apparent. Information from early focus groups or interviews may also inform refinements to the end-of-study questionnaires used to collect quantitative data on the consequences and integration of the intervention into routine practice from across a broad range of practices.</p>

These estimates are from the event rate and prevalence of predicted hospitalisations and A&amp;E attendance, as a whole and per practice, obtained from a database of 48,000 patients obtained from Optimum Patient Care, and the cluster size and ICC from our regional trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The average cluster size was estimated from CRNs. Patients will, as noted above, only be removed from the register in exceptional circumstances and we estimate that less than 10% of patients will leave their practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, we planned to evaluate a total of approximately 9170 patients with at-risk asthma from 262 practices. However, the initial average cluster size (39 patients per cluster) was greater than estimated and we propose to increase the sample size to 270 practices with 10,530 patients. If more than 10% of practices do not undergo minimum training and flagging, additional practices will be recruited. A decision to stop the study will be considered if the power of the study is reduced to less than 80% or when more than 30% of practices fail to undergo training to a minimal degree and/or do not activate the flag.</p>

As far as possible, those researchers not interacting with the practice sites will remain blind throughout the study and analysis.

The health economists will be blind during their initial determination of costs and until that point in the analysis plan where they must include costs associated with the allocation.

                  <p id="Par123">In line with the primary analysis, the health economic base-case analysis will be conducted on an ITT basis. Appropriate unit costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] will be assigned to each item of resource use for a standard price year. The incremental cost of the at-risk register compared with standard NHS care without an at-risk register, over the 12-month trial period, will then be estimated by comparing the mean overall cost (to the NHS) in each arm of the study (with adjustment for other factors, e.g. clustering). Similarly, the incremental effect will be estimated by comparing the mean number of asthma crisis events between arms. Additionally, based on data from other sources, we will attempt to assign an estimated loss in quality of life to each asthma-related crisis event, in order to enable the incremental effect to also be estimated in terms of Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs).</p>
                  <p id="Par124">The incremental cost and incremental effect will subsequently be used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the at-risk register. If dominance occurs, where the at-risk register is both associated with a lower (higher) cost and is more (less) effective, then the at-risk register would be estimated to be cost-effective (or not). Alternatively, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] will be estimated by dividing the incremental cost by the incremental effect, where this will be compared to any relevant thresholds, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] in order to assess value for money.</p>
                  <p id="Par125">Non-parametric bootstrapping will be used to explore the level of uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness results, and to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par133">This protocol describes a study that will explore the impact of a primary care practice-wide intervention designed to improve processes of care for at-risk asthma. It is based on a previous regional study, with modifications (automatic at-risk patient identification, online training and remote anonymous data capture) which permit large-scale implementation within a UK-wide multicentre study across a large number of diverse practices.</p>
              <p id="Par134">Our intervention comprises automatic generation of a list of people with at-risk asthma using a validated algorithm based on data available from primary care EHRs that are used by more than 90% of primary care practices in the UK. This permits standardised participant identification throughout the country and also between intervention and control practices. However we permit modification of the list of at-risk patients for use by the practice as we anticipate that clinical knowledge of their patients will allow refinement of the list. In addition, patients’ at-risk status is likely to change over time. We have also automated the training aspect of the intervention so that it is delivered via an online eLearning package plus a webinar. This means that the intervention could be rolled out throughout the UK and adopted into clinical practice quickly if our intervention is deemed beneficial. In this respect, a primary-care-based intervention, which included education and asthma-nurse-led patient reviews with an emphasis on self-management plans, has previously been shown to increase in the time to first attendance with acute asthma from 126 to 194 days (HR 0.73 (0.54–1)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], as do interventions which utilise a practice champion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our intervention is encouraged by a practice champion and individuals are reminded of the training via videos sent at 6 weeks and 6 months and also every time the flag appears.</p>
              <p id="Par135">We have designed the ARRISA-UK CDSS to maximise its impact. The CDSS is a single flag which appears automatically whenever the patients’ EHRs are opened (and is, therefore, timely) and it cannot be readily switched off by practice staff (it is, therefore, inescapable). The precise nature of the flag varies somewhat between practice software (which is one of the reasons that the study is stratified for practice software) and varies from a pop-up box to one that has to be cleared before any further action can be taken. The wording of the flag is agreed by the practice representatives at the second eLearning module (the group-based session where practice-wide action plans are agreed) and can be changed during the study, if required. The flag is designed to prompt actions as agreed in the practice action plan disseminated to all staff, so allows tailoring to practices’ existing processes of care.</p>
              <p id="Par136">The data required for the primary and secondary care outcomes will be obtained from anonymous extraction of routine healthcare data, without obtaining individual informed consent as has been the case in similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, we ask all practices to inform patients that their data may be used anonymously for research and practice managers will be asked to sign a contract with UEA on behalf of all practice staff. Written informed consent will be obtained from patients to participate in focus groups or interviews. We believe that this meets ethical standards as the intervention is at practice level and it is the practice staff/infrastructure that are directly involved, not the patients. The Read code identifying patients remains on the practice systems and only non-identifiable data will be extracted. The data extraction methods meet all legal requirements (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://optimumpatientcare.org/about-us/">http://optimumpatientcare.org/about-us/</ext-link>) and using anonymous patient data in this way is a recognised strategy to improve patient care in line with the government agenda including the care.data initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/tsd/care-data/">http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/tsd/care-data/</ext-link>).</p>
