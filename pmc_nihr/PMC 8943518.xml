                  <title>Aims/hypothesis</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Problematic hypoglycaemia still complicates insulin therapy for some with type 1 diabetes. This study describes baseline emotional, cognitive and behavioural characteristics in participants in the HARPdoc trial, which evaluates a novel intervention for treatment-resistant problematic hypoglycaemia.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We documented a cross-sectional baseline description of 99 adults with type 1 diabetes and problematic hypoglycaemia despite structured education in flexible insulin therapy. The following measures were included: Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey II (HFS-II); Attitudes to Awareness of Hypoglycaemia questionnaire (A2A); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Index; and Problem Areas In Diabetes. <italic>k</italic>-mean cluster analysis was applied to HFS-II and A2A factors. Data were compared with a peer group without problematic hypoglycaemia, propensity-matched for age, sex and diabetes duration (<italic>n</italic> = 81).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The HARPdoc cohort had long-duration diabetes (mean ± SD 35.8 ± 15.4 years), mean ± SD Gold score 5.3 ± 1.2 and a median (IQR) of 5.0 (2.0–12.0) severe hypoglycaemia episodes in the previous year. Most individuals had been offered technology and 49.5% screened positive for anxiety (35.0% for depression and 31.3% for high diabetes distress). The cohort segregated into two clusters: in one (<italic>n</italic> = 68), people endorsed A2A cognitive barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance, with low fear on HFS-II factors; in the other (<italic>n</italic> = 29), A2A factor scores were low and HFS-II high. Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in the comparator group.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions/interpretation</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The HARPdoc protocol successfully recruited people with treatment-resistant problematic hypoglycaemia. The participants had high anxiety and depression. Most of the cohort endorsed unhelpful health beliefs around hypoglycaemia, with low fear of hypoglycaemia, a combination that may contribute to persistence of problematic hypoglycaemia and may be a target for adjunctive psychological therapies.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par19">Severe hypoglycaemia (SH) is defined as an episode in which circulating glucose falls to a level too low to sustain normal cognitive function and self-treatment is not possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. SH remains a feared complication of insulin therapy for insulin-deficient diabetes. Recent publications reported that 12% of people with type 1 diabetes experienced one or more SH episode(s) over a 7–8 month follow-up period, with over 4% admitted to hospital for it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and recent data from the USA type 1 diabetes exchange registry showed that 5–10% of people reported SH-related coma or seizure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The prevalence of SH increases both with diabetes duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. IAH is a state in which people are often unable to recognise hypoglycaemia because of delayed and diminished symptomatic and neuroendocrine responses to a falling plasma glucose. IAH increases the risk of SH sixfold in type 1 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">The combination of IAH and recurrent SH is referred to as ‘problematic hypoglycaemia’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It impairs quality of life, may contribute to loss of driving privileges and places a burden on social, work and family life, as well as increasing the risk of emergency department visits and healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">Structured education in insulin dose adjustment and technological advances in glucose monitoring and insulin delivery have brought about substantial reduction in SH in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], enabling creation of an evidence-based treatment pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, population-level improvements in SH rates, which may have been rising prior to availability of CGM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], remain too high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The distribution of SH has always been very skewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and some individuals with type 1 diabetes continue to experience SH despite optimised education and technology utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These individuals contribute disproportionately to the overall rates of hypoglycaemia, remain poorly categorised, are frequently excluded from clinical trials, and represent a major unmet need in diabetes clinical care.</p>
              <p id="Par22">A better understanding of the psychology underpinning problematic hypoglycaemia is emerging. In a large unselected cohort of people with type 1 diabetes, those at high risk of SH have been categorised into different levels of personal concern about that risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The group with high SH risk and low fear of hypoglycaemia (8% of the total and one-third of those experiencing SH) may have reduced ability to avoid hypoglycaemia, as they do not prioritise it. People with IAH have shown reduced likelihood of behaviour change following clinical review in comparison with their peers with intact awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Qualitative studies in people with IAH have identified unhelpful thoughts or ‘thinking traps’ in relation to their experience of hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Using the Attitudes to Awareness of Hypoglycaemia questionnaire (A2A), these thinking traps have been grouped into categories: ‘asymptomatic hypoglycaemia normalised’; ‘hypoglycaemia concern minimised’; and ‘hyperglycaemia avoidance prioritised’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Psychological principles inform many of the structured education programmes that most successfully reduce the incidence of SH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], although none have eliminated the problem or been tested for their impact on SH and IAH in people with persistent SH after other interventions. The Hypoglycaemia Awareness Restoration Programme for people with type 1 diabetes and problematic hypoglycaemia persisting despite otherwise optimised control (HARPdoc) is a novel 6 week psychoeducational programme developed specifically to address the thinking traps associated with persistence of IAH in people who had completed other structured education in insulin self-management proven to reduce SH and also had access to technological support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The clinical and cost-effectiveness of HARPdoc is currently being compared against Blood Glucose Awareness Training (BGAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in an international, multicentre, pragmatic, parallel-arm RCT. The cohort recruited has given us the opportunity to study IAH in more detail and advance our understanding of its psychology.</p>
              <p id="Par24">This paper presents the baseline characteristics of the HARPdoc cohort to answer the following primary research questions: (1) what are the demographic, clinical and psychological characteristics of a large cohort of people with type 1 diabetes with problematic hypoglycaemia; and (2) are there clinical and psychological differences in subgroups of participants clustered according to their cognitions and their responses to the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey II (HFS-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] responses? As a secondary focus of this study, a comparator group of people with type 1 diabetes but without problematic hypoglycaemia was recruited to explore specific characteristics associated with the experience of problematic hypoglycaemia. The third aim of the study was to compare the population characteristics between the HARPdoc cohort and a matched peer group of people without problematic hypoglycaemia.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par25">The HARPdoc RCT protocol has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The trial recruited participants across three specialist diabetes centres in the UK and one in the USA between March 2017 and March 2019. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the flow of participants to recruitment. Eligible participants were adults with type 1 diabetes of at least 4 years duration, who had experienced problematic hypoglycaemia for at least 1 year, despite having participated in structured education and currently using a flexible insulin regimen. Problematic hypoglycaemia was defined as a Gold or Clarke score ≥4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and more than one episode of SH in the preceding 2 years, with at least one since being on current treatment. Eligible participants were willing to comply with the study design, including performance of glucose self-monitoring at least four times per day, able to communicate in written and spoken English and give written informed consent. The main exclusion criteria were as follows: type 2 diabetes; type 1 diabetes with preserved awareness of hypoglycaemia; no prior attendance at a structured diabetes education programme; currently awaiting islet or whole organ pancreas transplantation; current pregnancy; severe mental disorders including eating disorders; and cognitive impairment independent of hypoglycaemia and presence of an untreated comorbid medical disease other than diabetes that might be expected to contribute to hypoglycaemia risk.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flowchart up to randomisation. Those (<italic>n</italic> = 626) assessed for eligibility were people with diabetes who were judged as potential participants by clinicians. In one centre (<italic>n</italic> = 329) this was performed from the electronic patient record followed by cold-calling</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="125_2022_5679_Fig1_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par26">During the screening process, demographic data, medical history and vital signs were taken from eligible, consented participants. Baseline assessment was undertaken immediately prior to randomisation, once a full therapy group had been recruited and the course was ready to begin. Measures collected at the screening and baseline assessment stages form the set of pre-randomisation measures reported in this paper.</p>
                <p id="Par27">For a comparator group, we recruited a second cohort of adults with type 1 diabetes at the UK HARPdoc sites. Consecutive individuals attending for diabetes clinical consultations at the recruiting sites were assessed for the HARPdoc inclusion and exclusion criteria but did not have IAH (Gold or Clarke score ≤3). These participants formed the Cognitions Outcomes and Behaviours around hypoglycaemia in Adults with type 1 diabetes (COBrA) cohort.</p>
                <p id="Par28">The study was approved by the London Dulwich and the Wales Research Ethics Committees (IRAS numbers 216381 and 271164) and the Institutional Review Board of the Joslin Diabetes Center.</p>

It has two subscales for behaviour (HFS-B, items 1–15) and worry (HFS-W, items 16–33). Participants score each item from 0 (‘never’) to 4 (‘almost always’). Total and subscale scores are reported as the sum of the item rankings. Scores are also reported as mean item scores (total ranking sum score/no. of items in the scale or subscale), to allow comparisons to be made with published data using the original HFS, which has fewer items than the HFS-II. In data kindly supplied by T. Anderbro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] using the HFS-I survey in an unselected clinic population of 764 people, with ten behaviour and 27 worry items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the median of the behaviour subscale was 1.85 and for the worry subscale was 0.92 and values below these were taken to indicate low scores in the present data. While use of a single study to generate thresholds may introduce bias into these estimates, the broad and unselected clinic population of the Anderbro dataset makes it the most robust available source of normative values for the HFS.</p>

Each item was scored 0 (‘not at all true’) to 3 (‘very true’). Total score and the sum of the items in each of the three thinking styles described in the A2A are reported as follows: ‘asymptomatic hypoglycaemia normalised’ (items 6–7, 10 and 15); ‘hypoglycaemia concern minimised’ (items 11, 14, 17 and 18); and ‘hyperglycaemia avoidance prioritised’ (items 8, 12, 16 and 19).

Involvement of healthcare resources (expressed per 100 person-years) included 184 glucagon injections, 110 ambulance call outs, 41 presentations to emergency departments and eight inpatient stays. By protocol, all had attended education in flexible insulin therapy, mostly as structured group education using DAFNE (57.9%) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dafne.nhs.uk/">https://dafne.nhs.uk/</ext-link> [accessed 5 Feb 2022]), BERTIE (16.8%) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bertieonline.org.uk/">https://www.bertieonline.org.uk/</ext-link> [accessed 5 Feb 2022]), DO-IT (8.4%) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.joslin.org/patient-care/education-programs-and-classes/do-it-program">https://www.joslin.org/patient-care/education-programs-and-classes/do-it-program</ext-link> [accessed 5 Feb 2022]) or other (11.6%).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par44">Our data show that the HARPdoc trial successfully recruited a cohort of people with type 1 diabetes, IAH and recurrent SH that has persisted despite optimised conventional self-management of their insulin regimens. The cohort had long diabetes duration and high scores on screening for anxiety and depression but did not have high levels of diabetes distress. The rate of SH was high, with a median of five SH events in the previous year, demonstrating the high-risk nature of the participants enrolled. However, the rate was very skewed, with a mean of 30 events. This wide variation in rates of SH suggests heterogeneity in the population, and we also noted heterogeneity in the fears, behaviours and cognitions related to hypoglycaemia. Most notably, the group segregated into individuals who endorsed attitudinal barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance and had relatively low levels of fear and another group that had low scores on attitudinal barriers and expressed relatively high fear. A comparison between HARPdoc participants and a cohort of people matched for diabetes duration and sex but without problematic hypoglycaemia showed that the HARPdoc cohort overall exhibited higher worry about hypoglycaemia, although higher mean score for diabetes distress did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. The comparison analysis confirmed the high rates of anxiety and depression in the HARPdoc cohort. The two groups did not show significant differences when comparing attitudinal barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance.</p>
              <p id="Par45">This HARPdoc cohort represents one of the largest datasets of people with type 1 diabetes and treatment-resistant problematic hypoglycaemia and therefore provides a unique opportunity to examine the clinical and psychological characteristics of this group in detail. Higher levels of general anxiety and depression, as measured by the HADS, suggests a group with higher psychological comorbidity that may predispose to or exacerbate struggles with management of their problematic hypoglycaemia and a desire to avoid hyperglycaemia. Whether the anxiety and depression are driven by the problematic hypoglycaemia cannot be determined from these data.</p>
              <p id="Par46">As expected for people with IAH and high rates of severe episodes, the cohort has long diabetes duration. The duration of problematic hypoglycaemia was also long (&gt;10 years in over half of the participants), suggesting a level of unmet need within diabetes services. This raises questions about the efficacy of traditional medical interventions for this population. All the participants were attending specialist type 1 diabetes services, which offer delivery of the recommended treatments for hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Indeed, completion of structured education in flexible insulin therapy known to minimise rates of SH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] was an inclusion criterion. Most participants had been offered at least CSII therapy and/or CGM and over one-quarter had been offered sensor augmented pump therapy as a second-line intervention, a high percentage given that recruitment occurred between 2017 and 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While more recent improvements in diabetes technology, such as hybrid closed loop, might provide this cohort with better protection, it remains the case that only half used some form of technology and many who did try various devices discontinued the technology by the time of recruitment. In the comparison with the COBrA cohort, no more of the HARPdoc group were using technology than the group untroubled by hypoglycaemia, despite clinical guidelines recommending prioritising its use for people with problematic hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given earlier evidence for reduced engagement with healthcare-recommended therapeutic strategies in people with IAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], this disengagement with technology and persistence of problematic hypoglycaemia points to drivers of hypoglycaemia beyond traditional pharmacological and pathophysiological mechanisms. Meanwhile, recent data show the persistence of SH in 12% of people at low risk using retrospective intermittent CGM and 25% of people at high risk using real-time CGM. Less successful outcomes with technology are compatible with our hypothesis that there is an important group of people whose problematic hypoglycaemia fails to respond adequately even when technology is in place and who require additional approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">In previous studies, people with IAH have described health beliefs related to their hypoglycaemia that likely constitute barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; these have been postulated as contributors to the development and maintenance of IAH and recurrent SH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Low fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or ‘lack of concern’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have been described in some people with IAH and experience of SH, with low concern occurring in about one-third of people at high risk for SH in the study by Anderbro et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the HARPdoc cohort, the total HFS-II score was significantly higher than in the hypoglycaemia-aware COBrA group, although one-fifth of the participants with IAH had low worry about hypoglycaemia. Nevertheless, the data indicate that most of the HARPdoc participants were concerned about their hypoglycaemia when compared with the median values from a single reference study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and they may have exhibited more diabetes distress. In the present data, the absolute scores for the ‘thinking traps’ (the A2A factors) were not different between HARPdoc participants and those with intact awareness. One possibility is that some of the A2A questions are less relevant to people who have intact hypoglycaemia awareness, leading to unexpected answers in ‘asymptomatic hypoglycaemia normalised’, while we might expect that people in both cohorts may endorse cognitions associated with ‘hyperglycaemia avoidance prioritised’. Additionally, It may be that unhelpful beliefs are necessary but not sufficient to drive problematic behaviours and that the presence of other mediating factors, such as certain personality traits, can affect how beliefs influence behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par48">To examine this further, a clustering analysis was conducted to investigate the interaction between cognitive barriers (A2A factors) and fear of hypoglycaemia (HFS-II factors) in the HARPdoc cohort. The people in one cluster endorsed cognitive barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance, with above average scores on A2A factors, but had lower scores in the HFS-II factors (‘high barriers/low fear’). In contrast, people in the second cluster showed the reverse pattern, with low endorsement of the cognitive barriers and higher fear of hypoglycaemia scores (‘low barriers/high fear’). The two groups did not differ in age, diabetes duration, technology use or their responses to the hyperglycaemia avoidance scale. The main difference between the clusters appeared to be in the lower HADS anxiety and depression scores in the low fear/high barriers group. We speculate that it is people in this cluster who are likely to benefit from, and perhaps even need, therapies that directly target the cognitive ‘thinking traps’. The HARPdoc trial outcome data will allow us to explore this hypothesis. The two clusters differed significantly in Gold score and SH frequency, with the ‘high fear/low barriers’ cluster reporting greater severity of IAH and more SH events in the prior year. We postulate that people with high fear may be strongly motivated towards behavioural change and therefore may benefit from either trial intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Avoidance of hyperglycaemia and complications of diabetes can be a rationale for excessive lowering of blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The similar rates of retinopathy reported in the HARPdoc and COBrA cohorts may indicate that this strategy is not always effective in reducing microvascular complications, perhaps related to the lack of significant difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and also perhaps because of stress and inflammation related to hypoglycaemia or higher glycaemic variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The cross-sectional nature of these observations makes it impossible to ascribe causality; however, in the HARPdoc cohort problematic hypoglycaemia appears to occur frequently as part of a constellation of medical and psychiatric conditions. It will be important to look for evidence of improvement in mood and anxiety disorders as part of the anticipated recovery from IAH or recurrent SH in the HARPdoc trial.</p>
              <p id="Par50">The strengths of the present study include the number of participants recruited as having high burden of SH and significant impairment in symptomatic awareness of hypoglycaemia. This has allowed us to examine psychological variables that characterise individuals in this population. The cohort of people without problematic hypoglycaemia but matched for diabetes duration and sex, two major influences on hypoglycaemia risk, provided a robust comparator group.</p>
              <p id="Par51">There are limitations to this study. First, as a cross-sectional analysis of a trial population we may have recruited a biased sample willing to participate in a research study. We also recognise that recruitment targets for the HARPdoc RCT were based on a power calculation to detect differences in the outcomes of participants undertaking either HARPdoc or BGAT. Despite this, evidence suggests that our cluster sizes are sufficient to make accurate assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We also acknowledge that self-reported SH events may be subject to potential recall bias. This is mitigated by evidence for accurate recall of SH over 12 months and the use of anonymised reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par52">To conclude, this study describes in detail the demographic, medical and psychological characteristics of the participants in the HARPdoc study by virtue of their type 1 diabetes and treatment-resistant problematic hypoglycaemia. As a group, they experience a high burden of anxiety and depression. They can be broadly divided into two subgroups described as having high barriers/low fear and low barriers/high fear to hypoglycaemia avoidance and hypoglycaemia itself, respectively. The heterogeneity in emotional, cognitive and behavioural characteristics supports the need for complex and flexible interventions that can address numerous barriers to improving hypoglycaemia symptom awareness and hypoglycaemia risk. The HARPdoc trial will allow us to examine whether the identified mental health issues resolve with a unique intervention targeting cognitions and whether holding certain cognitive barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance with low fear of hypoglycaemia predicts the need for a cognitive intervention such as HARPdoc.</p>
