                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Prospective, single-arm, investigator-sponsored interventional clinical trial. Within-participant control comprising residual vision with the retinal implant switched ON versus OFF in the implanted eye.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>The Retina Implant Alpha AMS was implanted into the worse-seeing eye of 6 participants with end-stage RP and no useful perception of light vision. Eligibility criteria included previous normal vision for ≥12 years and no significant ocular or systemic comorbidity.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Vision assessments were scheduled at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postimplantation. They comprised tabletop object recognition tasks, a self-assessment mobility questionnaire, and screen-based tests including Basic Light and Motion (BaLM), grating acuity, and greyscale contrast discrimination. A full-field stimulus test (FST) was also performed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Main Outcome Measures</title>
                  <p>Improvement in activities of daily living, recognition tasks, and assessments of light perception with the implant ON compared with OFF.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>All 6 participants underwent successful implantation. Light perception and temporal resolution with the implant ON were achieved in all participants. Light localization was achieved with the implant ON in all but 1 participant (P4) in whom the chip was not functioning optimally because of a combination of iatrogenic intraoperative implant damage and incorrect implantation. Implant ON correct grating detections (which were at chance level with implant OFF) were recorded in the other 5 participants, ranging from 0.1 to 3.33 cycles/degree on 1 occasion. The ability to locate high-contrast tabletop objects not seen with the implant OFF was partially restored with the implant ON in all but 1 participant (P4). There were 2 incidents of conjunctival erosion and 1 inferotemporal macula-on retinal detachment, which were successfully repaired, and 2 incidents of inadvertent damage to the implant during surgery (P3 and P4).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The Alpha AMS subretinal implant improved visual performance in 5 of 6 participants and has exhibited ongoing function for up to 24 months. Although implantation surgery remains challenging, new developments such as OCT microscope guidance added refinements to the surgical technique.</p>

            <p id="p0010">Inherited retinal degenerations are the most common cause of blindness in the working-age population,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> yet a scarcity of treatment options exist for this group of patients. Although the prospect of targeting degenerate photoreceptors with retinal gene therapy holds promise, an alternative strategy for patients with end-stage disease may be required. In this setting, an electronic retinal prosthesis can subsume the role of phototransduction by directly stimulating the remaining inner retina in response to incident light. Only 4 devices have been granted CE Mark for commercial use in the European Economic Area: Retina Implant Alpha IMS (first-generation device, Retina Implant AG, Reutlingen, Germany), Retina Implant Alpha AMS (second-generation device, Retina Implant AG), Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (Second Sight Medical Products Inc, Sylmar, CA), and IRIS II (Pixium Vision, Paris, France). The key distinction between the Alpha devices and the Argus II or IRIS II systems is that the former consists of a photodiode array located in the subretinal space (i.e., in the anatomic plane of the degenerate photoreceptors), whereas the latter 2 comprise an epiretinal array located on the surface of the retina.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> A further difference is that the Alpha implant performs both light detection and charge transfer to the overlying inner retina, whereas the Argus II and IRIS II use a spectacle-mounted digital camera to detect incident light that is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant's receiver.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> A small number of key changes were introduced into the latest Alpha device to prolong its functional lifespan. These included (1) switching from a monophasic (direct current) to a biphasic (alternating current) pulse, (2) a new and slightly larger chip comprising 1600 stimulation units (the IMS had 1500), and (3) a necessarily wider polyimide foil to accommodate the new chip. No significant change to the implantation surgery was required.</p>
            <p id="p0015">We set out to assess the safety and efficacy of the Alpha AMS, the latest iteration of the subretinal implant, in patients with profound visual loss from end-stage retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A cohort of 6 participants were enrolled over a 12-month period as part of the Oxford Retinal Implant Alpha AMS Trial sponsored by the University of Oxford and independently funded by an Invention for Innovation (i4i) award from the National Institute for Health Research. The study was registered as a clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" id="intref0010">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>

                <title>Participants and Eligibility Criteria</title>
                <p id="p0020">Six patients with advanced RP, aged 45 to 63 years (mean, 53 years), were recruited to the trial after National Research Ethics Committee approval (ref. 15/LO/0445) via the outpatient clinics of the Oxford Eye Hospital in the Oxford University Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust. Key eligibility criteria were nonuseful light perception or no light perception vision in 1 or both eyes, a period of normal visual function for ≥12 years, no additional ocular pathology, no significant systemic diseases, and a reliable electrically evoked phosphene response in the eye receiving the implant.</p>
                <p id="p0025">Informed consent was obtained, and the research followed the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki (seventh revision, 2013). A senior optometrist and an ophthalmologist assessed baseline vision independently. In all 6 participants, this was recorded as vague nonlocalizing perception of light in the eye to be implanted, which was also pseudophakic. Residual inner retinal function was confirmed by eliciting an electrically evoked phosphene response<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> with active Dawson, Trick, and Litzkow electrodes and an OkuStim device (Okuvision GmbH, Kusterdingen, Germany). The genetic mutation was known for all 6 participants (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and there was no other significant ocular pathology (e.g., glaucoma). Participants underwent 3 days of vision testing and assessments at months 1 (implant switch on), 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 (conclusion of study). Ongoing off-study visits continued after 12 months as per standard NHS care at this center.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical Details</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study Code</th><th>Age, yrs</th><th>Gender</th><th>Affected Gene</th><th>Operated Eye</th><th>Follow-up (mos)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>P1</td><td align="char">45</td><td>F</td><td><italic>USH2A</italic></td><td>L</td><td align="char">24<xref rid="tbl1fndagger" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td>P2</td><td align="char">49</td><td>F</td><td><italic>PDE6B</italic></td><td>R</td><td align="char">24<xref rid="tbl1fndagger" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td>P3</td><td align="char">48</td><td>F</td><td><italic>RPE65</italic></td><td>R</td><td align="char">3<xref rid="tbl1fnlowast" ref-type="table-fn">∗</xref></td></tr><tr><td>P4</td><td align="char">57</td><td>F</td><td><italic>USH2A</italic></td><td>R</td><td align="char">9</td></tr><tr><td>P5</td><td align="char">54</td><td>M</td><td><italic>RPGR</italic></td><td>L</td><td align="char">6</td></tr><tr><td>P6</td><td align="char">63</td><td>F</td><td><italic>CERKL</italic></td><td>L</td><td align="char">3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fnlowast"><label>∗</label><p id="ntpara0055">Explanted after conjunctival revision surgery at 3 months follow-up.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fndagger"><label>†</label><p id="ntpara0060">Off-study follow-up past 12 months.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

                <title>Alpha AMS Subretinal Implant</title>
                <p id="p0030">The light-detecting subretinal component of the Alpha AMS comprises a 4.0 × 3.2-mm × 70-μm silicone microchip coated on 1 side with 1600 stimulation units. It was designed by the University of Ulm, Institute for Microelectronis<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and produced by AMS AG (Premstätten, Austria). Each stimulation unit has a dimension of 70 × 70-μm and includes a photodiode, an amplifier, and a stimulation electrode. Each unit cluster on the chip surface stimulates the overlying retinal tissue with a current according to the local light intensity, with the sensitivity of the chip adjusted by the participant to suit the ambient light intensity. The chip requires a power supply to convert incident light into a current detectible by the adjacent cells of the overlying inner retina. Power reaches the chip via the polyimide foil, which connects through a silicone cable to a sub-periosteal ceramic-housed induction coil that couples with an external inductive patch attached magnetically behind the ear. The participant carries a power supply box (that uses regular household AA batteries), which has controls for adjustment of signal gain and sensitivity in the amplifiers integrated into each of the 1600 stimulation units in response to ambient light conditions. The principal design of this approach was developed by the SUBRET-consortium,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and proof-of-concept was shown in 2 pilot studies.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>

                <title>Implantation Surgery</title>
                <p id="p0035">The first phase of the operation was performed by an experienced cochlear implant surgeon (JDR). A posterior auricular skin and periosteal incision was made, followed by creation of a shallow recess in the mastoid bone into which the ceramic housing of the induction coil was embedded. Next, a skin and periosteal incision over the superolateral orbital rim was made before a trocar was used to create a subcutaneous tunnel between the 2 incisions, enabling passage of the retinal implant and cable from behind the ear to inside the orbit. A 360° conjunctival peritomy followed by blunt dissection to bypass the lacrimal gland was then performed, creating a further passage for the chip and distal cable through orbital fat to the eye. A fornix-based partial-thickness scleral trapdoor was constructed in the superotemporal quadrant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) followed by a standard 20-gauge pars plana vitrectomy. A subretinal bleb was created that encompassed the macula and superotemporal retina by injecting balanced salt solution with an extendible 41-gauge subretinal injection cannula (DORC BV, Zuidland, the Netherlands) connected to the viscous fluid injection port of the Constellation Vision System (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The subretinal space was accessed via a linear sclerotomy and choroidotomy at the base of the scleral flap and kept open using Healon (Abbott Medical Optics Inc, Santa Ana, CA). A flexible guide foil was advanced to the subfoveal region, which enabled the retinal implant, embedded within a polyimide foil, to glide over the guide foil to the same location (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). After positioning the chip array subfoveally (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), the guide foil was removed. The connecting cable was sutured to the sclera via an integrated silicone mesh, which was then covered with a scleral patch graft. All eyes received a silicone oil (1300 cSt) endotamponade.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Implanting the subretinal chip.

The same 5 participants reached the secondary end point of improved visual function with the device ON versus OFF using a range of screen-based standardized low vision assessments (BaLM and Basic Grating Acuity). The study protocol prescribed a maximum of 12 months follow-up postimplantation; thus far, this has been accomplished for the first 2 participants (P1 and P2). P5 has reached 6 months of follow-up, and P6 has passed 3 months of follow-up. Gain and sensitivity controls did not function normally at “switch-on” for P4 due to a presumed electrical malfunction of the device. It was subsequently determined that this was the result of microtrauma to the polyimide foil that occurred at the time of primary surgery together with incorrect implantation. In P3, the device stopped working after a secondary conjunctival advancement procedure to cover an area of late-onset foil exposure between months 2 and 3. Subsequent explantation revealed iatrogenic microtrauma to the polyimide foil waterproof seal where it had been refolded to reposition it posteriorly.</p>

When the implant was OFF, all participants performed poorly: P2, 3, 5, and 6 were unable to discern any contrast combinations at any visits. Consistent with her evident residual native vision, P1 was able to correctly discriminate between side-by-side greyscale levels of 0% and 50% with the implant OFF in 3 of 3 presentations of that combination at months 3, 9, and 12 and had an overall correct response rate of 23% for all contrast combinations with the implant OFF over the 12-month study period. It was not possible to make a reliable comparison between implant ON and OFF for the control screens (which presented just 1 greyscale value).

These included being able to locate or see balls on a billiards table, outlines of windows and doorways, metallic kitchen appliances (e.g., kettle and toaster), black and white laundry items, the outline of a Scottish highland mountain against the setting sun, a passing car, Christmas lights, and building edges. The device was helpful for determining the ambient light level (e.g., whether it was a bright or cloudy day) or when there was shade (e.g., walking under an overhanging tree). An improvement in the vision of the fellow eye was reported by P6 and by P5, who gave a specific example of seeing his hand on 1 occasion using the nonoperated eye.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Participants' Descriptions of Experience with Implant at Home</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Participant</th><th>Activities Performed and Objects Seen</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="7">P1</td><td>Able to find swimming pool</td></tr><tr><td>Tea and coffee machines in restaurant</td></tr><tr><td>Metal-colored kitchen appliances, e.g., kettle, stainless-steel sink</td></tr><tr><td>Able to navigate familiar paths and steps in garden</td></tr><tr><td>Able to see the sea against the sky</td></tr><tr><td>Locate snooker balls on snooker table</td></tr><tr><td>Better in bright conditions</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="12">P2</td><td>White sockets against black tiles</td></tr><tr><td>Kitchen cupboards</td></tr><tr><td>Steps in home</td></tr><tr><td>Outline of people against backlight</td></tr><tr><td>Plant in sitting room</td></tr><tr><td>Shadows of TV</td></tr><tr><td>Outline of windows</td></tr><tr><td>Can tell when cloudy</td></tr><tr><td>Outlines of cars parked against curb</td></tr><tr><td>Gaps between houses</td></tr><tr><td>Occasionally able to see white line in center of the road</td></tr><tr><td>Black and white socks</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="9">P3</td><td>Better able to find doorways in home</td></tr><tr><td>Able to tell dark areas, light areas when on walks outside</td></tr><tr><td>Letter on doormat</td></tr><tr><td>Could determine which light switches controlled certain lights in home</td></tr><tr><td>Able to make out shape of horse in field</td></tr><tr><td>Could navigate down laneway without white stick following verge line</td></tr><tr><td>Aware of difference between grass and tarmac</td></tr><tr><td>Friend observed that she had better posture</td></tr><tr><td>Gaps between buildings</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">P5</td><td>Building edges</td></tr><tr><td>Skyline</td></tr><tr><td>Outline of Scottish highlands mountain against setting sun</td></tr><tr><td>Navigate around workshop</td></tr><tr><td>White plates on black background</td></tr><tr><td>Feels that nonoperated eye has improved</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">P6</td><td>Could see Christmas lights</td></tr><tr><td>Window frames</td></tr><tr><td>Car passing on street</td></tr><tr><td>Dog's white harness</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

                  <p id="p0155">There were 5 adverse events in total, 4 relating to the electronic implant (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). External erosion over the foil was successfully repaired in P1 2 months postimplantation. A similar event occurred twice to P3, and the entire device was subsequently removed, with no adverse sequelae, after inadvertent iatrogenic damage to the laminate insulation of the polyimide foil during conjunctival erosion repair at month 3. A peripheral retinal detachment occurred in the implant eye of P2 at 9 months, but reattachment surgery was performed as a day case without disturbing chip position. A skin rash over the back of P4 developed after her surgery for a contact dermatitis, which resolved within 2 weeks. The implant device in P4 did not function normally from switch at month 1. It was subsequently explanted, and a new (off-study) implant was reinserted at the same operation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig S3</xref>, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aaojournal.org" id="intref0035">www.aaojournal.org</ext-link>). Subjective (off-study) descriptions of the new device in use included indications of improved performance, for example, seeing her hands, including her wedding ring, against the black coat of her guide dog. In the evenings, P4 reported identifying streetlights, shop-front windows, and lights through her house window as she approached the front door.

              <p id="p0160">The Alpha AMS subretinal implant provided objective and participant-reported functional benefit to this NHS-based patient cohort with profound blindness secondary to RP. As with the antecedent Alpha IMS retinal implant device,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> preliminary assessment of the AMS implant in this Oxford-based study has shown that the electronic subretinal prosthesis can provide measurable visual gains in a specific group of patients with RP, that is, those with residual inner retinal function. Improvements in vision-related quality of life and real-world function have been reported in larger cohorts with the Argus II epiretinal prosthesis.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Although no head-to-head trial between the 2 devices has been conducted, introduction of standardized assessment protocols for extreme low vision<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> may facilitate future comparison between different retinal prostheses. There are presently no data available on clinical trial outcomes for the IRIS II device.</p>
              <p id="p0165">A relatively intact inner retina is required to transmit light-induced chip activity to the visual pathway. The utility of both external or internal electrical retinal stimulation to predict the sensitivity of the human visual system has been reported in a number of disease states.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Because a degree of ganglion cell loss undoubtedly occurs in end-stage RP,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> it was critical to screen potential participants for residual inner retinal function with an electrically evoked phosphene test; absent electrically evoked phosphene tests were a study exclusion criterion.</p>
              <p id="p0170">Thus far, the Alpha AMS has exhibited superior longevity compared with its predecessor, the Alpha IMS, in the present study and in laboratory tests.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Of note, the reasons for failure were iatrogenic damage during revision surgery in P3 and damage to the foil and incorrect insertion technique in P4, rather than erosion of electrical insulation as was seen in the Alpha IMS, which bodes well for future clinical applications. Although IMS results were significantly better with the implant ON compared with the implant OFF in the first 3 months, a number of the former devices failed after 3 to 12 months.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> By comparison, the Alpha AMS has been functioning now for more than 24 months in the first 2 participants recruited to the trial (P1 and P2).</p>
              <p id="p0175">In P4, the implant gain and sensitivity controls did not respond at device “switch on,” severely limiting its utility for testing and general-purpose use between follow-up visits (some limited function was detected on the BaLM and FST tests only). A decision was made to explant the subretinal device as an “off-study” procedure after 9 months. This was the first time a same eye Alpha AMS combined explantation and implantation procedure had been performed. Reassuringly, the new device has since functioned normally, providing subjective visual benefits to daily activities. Iatrogenic damage to the polyimide foil protective coating was responsible for device failure in P3; however, before this, the device had been functioning well, for example, allowing P3 to identify her horse in a field and to discern a white envelope on the front doormat. She was also able to navigate independently down a country lane with the chip switched ON. The likely cause of conjunctival retraction and foil exposure was tension at the limbal wound due to anterior prominence of the scleral patch. Although alternatives to scleral allograft exist (e.g., temporalis fascia autograft<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>), the risk of wound dehiscence was ameliorated in subsequent cases by construction of a 2-mm corneoscleral pocket to receive the anterior most edge of the scleral graft, thus smoothing the conjunctival profile and lessening tissue tension in the vicinity of the limbal conjunctival wound. It is likely that surgical techniques will improve with further refinements as we gain more experience with retinal implant surgery.</p>
              <p id="p0180">Estimating maximum theoretic chip-mediated visual acuity is based on stimulation unit density and chip dimensions. A spatial resolution of 16 minutes of arc (0.26 degrees) and a visual field of approximately 15 degrees (diagonally) are potentially obtainable with the Alpha AMS chip. A participant using an Alpha AMS implant could theoretically gain a best-corrected visual acuity of approximately 6/96, but this was not achieved by any participants in this study. The best performance on detecting grating orientation testing was from P1, who could discern the directions of gratings with a spatial frequency of 3.33 cpd, a theoretic logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) equivalent of 0.95 and approximate Snellen acuity of 6/60. However, the patient was unable to reliably discern Landolt C letters on further testing, suggesting a disparity between the 2 methods of acuity determination; furthermore, she achieved this result on only 1 occasion (at 6 months). Two-point discrimination and optotype recognition ability for very low vision cannot directly be compared with grating acuity because the detection of long lines involves multiple—possibly even dispersed—photosensor areas, the elongated stimulation of which can be recognized as lines. All participants with functioning implants achieved at least a logMAR equivalent of 2.48 (0.1 cpd), which compared favorably with a cohort of Argus II patients in whom 48% scored a grating acuity–derived logMAR of 2.9 or better at 1 year.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The best reported comparable acuity attained by the Argus II system was 1.6 logMAR, or 20/1262 (6/379).<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The best grating acuity reported from the Alpha IMS was 3.3 cpd (0.96 logMAR) in 1 patient who reached 20/546 (6/164) Snellen equivalent (1.4 logMAR) on Landolt C-ring testing.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> However, it is important to note that the Argus II trial used a 4-AFC test, rather than the 2-AFC test used here, which was limited to 5 seconds. Furthermore, the psychophysical staircase criterion used to adjust the grating width in the Argus II test was extremely strict, for example, subjects whose grating acuity was reported as &gt;2.9 logMAR achieved that result because they could not maintain a threshold below 2.7 logMAR for up to 40 trials.</p>
              <p id="p0185">Localized iatrogenic detachment of degenerate retina has been performed for the subretinal delivery of adeno-associated viral gene therapy vectors for <italic>RPE65</italic> and <italic>MERTK</italic>-associated RP,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and choroideremia.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> In this study, a significantly larger retinal detachment was required to permit safe passage of the AMS chip and PI foil toward the posterior pole, passing underneath pigmented degenerate retina. The benefit of using an integrated OCT surgical microscope for implantation of the epiretinal Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System was recently reported.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> It was similarly effective in facilitating submacular chip implantation with enhanced accuracy and surgeon confidence in our study. Specifically, it was most helpful when initiating the retinal detachment before implant insertion and for visualizing safe advancement of the guide foil or chip in the correct tissue plane, between the retina and retinal pigment epithelium. Our positive experience with this technology will see its use mandated in all future similar cases at this center.</p>
              <p id="p0190">In summary, this preliminary report has shown that the recently CE-marked Alpha AMS retina implant performed at least as well as the previous generation Alpha IMS device in a small cohort of patients with end-stage RP. Critically, the new model has thus far demonstrated superior longevity to the IMS device. Advances in ophthalmic technology (e.g., use of the integrated OCT operating microscope) lessened the difficulty of the most technically demanding step of the procedure—subretinal positioning of the chip—making the surgery relatively safer and more predictable.</p>
