                  <title>Methods and design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of a 10-day course of intravenous azithromycin (20 mg/kg for 3 days; 10 mg/kg for 7 days) administered to preterm infants born at &lt; 30 weeks’ gestational age across UK tertiary neonatal units. Following parental consent, infants are randomly allocated to azithromycin or placebo, with allocated treatment starting within 72 h of birth. The primary outcome is survival without moderate/severe CLD at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age (PMA). Serial respiratory fluid and stool samples are being collected up to 21 days of life. The target sample size is 796 infants, which is based on detecting a 12% absolute difference in survival without moderate/severe CLD at 36 weeks’ PMA (90% power, two-sided alpha of 0.05) and includes 10% loss to follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarised by treatment arm and in total. Categorical data will be summarised by numbers and percentages. Continuous data will be summarised by mean, standard deviation, if data are normal, or median, interquartile range, if data are skewed. Tests of statistical significance will not be undertaken for baseline characteristics. The primary analysis, on the intention to treat (ITT) population, will be analysed using multilevel logistic regression, within a multiple imputation framework. Adjusted odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and <italic>p</italic>-values will be presented. For all other analyses, the analysis population will be based on the complete case population, which is a modified ITT population. All analyses will be adjusted for gestational age and treatment arm and account for any clustering by centre and/or multiple births as a random effect.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par30">The AZTEC trial (Azithromycin Therapy for Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity) is a randomised placebo-controlled trial to determine if a 10-day course of intravenous azithromycin improves rates of survival without chronic lung disease at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age. This trial is supported by the National Institute of Health Research’s (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme. The study protocol has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">This paper describes the AZTEC trial statistical analysis plan (SAP) in advance of the trial completion. The SAP was written by the trial statisticians (TP, DG, ML) and trial manager (JL) and overseen by the chief investigator (CI, SK) and CTU director (KH). It describes the procedures to be followed for the clinical primary and secondary outcomes analyses for the trial. The final study report will follow the guidelines of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for reporting randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">The SAP has been written in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines (E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials and E3 Structure and content of clinical study reports) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and with the Guidelines on Missing Data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>

              <title>Background information</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p id="Par33">Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is a common adverse outcome of preterm infants which results in significant respiratory morbidity in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and beyond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par34">Although neonatal care has improved markedly over time, the limits of viability now extend down to 23 weeks’ gestation. Since an increasing proportion of preterm-born infants who are born at an extremely early stage of lung development (canalicular/saccular) now survive, the rates of CLD have remained largely unchanged. It has been well established that these infants suffer from a “new” form of CLD with an aetiology based around lung immaturity and consequent inflammation causing parenchymal tissue damage and subsequent airway remodelling.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Studies utilising samples of airway secretions have demonstrated this inflammation peaks between 7 and 10 days after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and is exacerbated by both antenatal and nosocomial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For many years, infection with the microbe <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CLD through indirectly stimulating the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. A systematic review noted that infection with <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> was associated with increased odds of developing CLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">In efforts to reduce rates of infection, early clinical studies focused on the use of macrolide antibiotics, particularly erythromycin and clarithromycin, to eradicate <italic>Ureaplasma</italic>. Unfortunately, the majority have been heterogeneous in design and largely underpowered thus rates of CLD in treated groups were unchanged. Additionally, the choice of macrolide, dosage, timing, and duration of therapy were not sufficiently optimised to address both the infective and pulmonary inflammatory processes that contribute to the development of CLD.</p>
                <p id="Par37">More recent trials have focused on the use of azithromycin due to its effectiveness in eradicating <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> but also for its unique anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The studies included in the meta-analysis by Nair and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] demonstrated proof-of-concept that azithromycin may be effective in reducing rates of CLD, with few reports of any serious adverse reactions. Moreover, pharmacokinetic studies by the Viscardi group has also confirmed the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp. infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par38">Given that the current preventative strategies for CLD are largely supportive, there is clear unmet need for new therapies to improve respiratory outcomes for this vulnerable group of infants. A definitive, adequately powered randomised placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin, addressing both the infective and inflammatory aspects of the disease is required. The AZTEC trial fulfils this gap by determining if 10-day treatment with intravenous azithromycin improves rates of survival without CLD at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age (PMA) when compared with placebo.</p>

                <p id="Par39">The primary objective for the AZTEC trial is to determine the effectiveness of azithromycin in increasing survival without physiologically defined CLD (moderate/severe) when compared to placebo.</p>

                <p id="Par45">AZTEC is a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin for the prevention of chronic lung disease of prematurity in preterm infants. 796 infants &lt; 30 weeks’ gestational age are being enrolled over a 30 month recruitment period from 28 level 3 neonatal units in the United Kingdom (UK). Trial treatment (azithromycin or placebo) is daily for 10 days, with follow-up until 36 weeks’ PMA. Serial respiratory fluid and stool samples will be collected until approximately 21 days of life.</p>
                <p id="Par46">The main trial included an internal pilot phase, which assessed the feasibility of trial participation; recruitment and consent rates; treatment compliance; and primary outcome completeness for 12 months (9 months of recruitment and 3 months of follow-up) in 5 tertiary neonatal units. The internal pilot report was reviewed by the funder, Trial Steering Committee (TSC), and the AZTEC Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) who all recommended the continuation of the pilot phase into the main trial after suggesting minor adjustments to improve recruitment rates.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par62">The IMP for AZTEC is azithromycin 500 mg (Zedbac™, Aspire pharma Ltd, UK) which is a lyophilized powder for solution for infusion in a 10-mL vial under vacuum, equivalent to 500 mg of azithromycin for intravenous administration (524 mg of azithromycin dihydrate is equivalent to 500 mg azithromycin base, citric acid, sodium hydroxide). The placebo is an empty sterile 10 mL vial under vacuum. Azithromycin powder for solution for infusion and placebo is packaged in identical 10 ml vials with the same cap, stopper, and vial. Each vial of active IMP and placebo is blinded with a tamper-evident custom-made cardboard box to ensure contents are not visible during the reconstitution process. Each participant’s Treatment Pack contains 12 vials of azithromycin or placebo. Labelling complies with Annex 13 of good manufacturing practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par63">The dosing schedule is 20 mg/kg (10 mL/kg) azithromycin for 3 days, followed by 10 mg/kg (5 mL/kg) for 7 days, or placebo (10 days total). All doses are given via intravenous infusion (central or peripheral line) over a period of at least 1 h. Azithromycin is most likely to be effective in eradicating <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp. if administered as early as possible after birth; a 20-mg/kg dose for 3 days has recently been shown to be highly effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp. in the UK are generally sensitive to macrolides including azithromycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Treatment for a further 7 days was chosen to target the pulmonary inflammation which peaks between 7 and 10 days after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Sites have, therefore, been asked to aim for initiation of trial treatment at the earliest opportunity (and within 72 h after birth at the latest).</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p id="Par65">The primary outcome is defined as a composite outcome of survival at 36 weeks’ PMA and the absence of CLD (moderate/severe severity) at 36 weeks’ PMA. The derivation of this composite primary outcome requires the combination of multiple sources on the Baby Outcomes 36 Weeks’ PMA case report forms (CRF). The Baby Outcomes 36 Weeks’ PMA CRF was completed when the infant reached 36 weeks’ PMA or discharged home if earlier. Death is defined in the tick box in ‘Details about baby’ on the Baby Outcomes 36 Weeks’ PMA CRF. The severity of CLD is based on consensus criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Severity-based criteria of diagnosis of CLD at 36 weeks’ PMA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2">Received respiratory support and/or supplementary oxygen for more than 28 days, cumulatively, and the following:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Mild CLD</td><td align="left">• Breathing room air</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Moderate CLD</td><td align="left">• Require &lt; 30% oxygen (or low flow 0.01–1.0 L/ min), not receiving any respiratory support</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Severe CLD</td><td align="left">• Require ≥ 30% oxygen (or low flow ≥ 1.1 L/min), still receiving respiratory support (ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], high flow oxygen)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

                  <p id="Par83">The AZTEC trial focuses on IMP ‘initiation’ and ‘implementation’ as the two adherence elements of interest. A participant is defined as having initiated treatment during the dosing window, if ‘Yes’ under the column “IMP given today?” on the Daily log within 72 h of life has been ticked. Implementation is defined as the extent to which a participant has received their IMP as intended. This will be expressed as the number of doses the participant receives within the ten-day dosing window divided by ten, giving the total proportion of expected daily doses.</p>

                <title>Sample size and power</title>
                <p id="Par85">Relevant interventional studies investigating CLD as an outcome (including studies using macrolides) in preterm infants vary in terms of their event rate. For example, the Ballard data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] showed a survival rate without CLD of 50%, including death rate of 20% and 30% rate for development of CLD. In general, national and international studies consistently show rates of survival without CLD of 50–60% (those with lower rates are due to highly selected groups of sicker participants). Thus, adopting a conservative approach using 50% survival without developing CLD was reasonable. An effect size of 12% was deemed clinically worthwhile difference that would be convincing in the clinical arena and impact routine use. An improvement of 12% (50 to 62%) in survival without CLD with a power of 0.90 and a significance level of 5% would require 796 subjects (including a dropout rate of 10%). Since the trial involves formal assessment with an oxygen challenge test in both tertiary units and in step-down units, a dropout rate of 10% has been included in the overall target of 796 infants.</p>

                <title>Intervention allocation</title>

The system is operational 24 h a day. Randomisation is performed by delegated members of the local neonatal trial team only after the parents/guardians of the infant have signed the consent form and the local team have completed the baseline assessments. The delegated individuals are provided with individual login details for the online system. Infants are randomised to either azithromycin or placebo using minimisation to balance treatment by site and gestational age. Infants from multiple births are randomised individually.</p>
                <p id="Par87">The randomisation code list was generated by an independent statistician at the CTR who was not involved with the AZTEC trial. The randomisation lists were generated (1:1 ratio) using block randomisation. As AZTEC is a double-blind trial, the infant’s family, clinicians, nurses, and trial team (including the data manager and statistician) are all unaware of the treatment arm to which the participant has been allocated for the duration of the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par88">Each treatment pack is labelled with a unique identification number (Pack ID). Sortition allocates a Pack ID for each participant. The participant Study IDs and Pack IDs are linked in the randomisation file, which is only accessible by an independent statistician, and the pharmacovigilance team for the purposes of unblinding for regulatory reporting.</p>

Infants will be classified by the severity of CLD as defined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

                  <p id="Par151">The primary outcome will be analysed using a random-effects multilevel logistic regression, within a multiple imputation framework. The analysis will adjust for treatment arm and gestational age (&lt; 28 weeks or 28 to &lt; 30 weeks) and account for both clustering of both multiple births and participants within the recruitment sites. Results will be presented as adjusted odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and <italic>p</italic>-values. Should convergence difficulties be encountered when fitting both multiple births and centres as levels, the primary analysis will drop multiple births as a level.</p>

Models will be formally compared using the likelihood ratio test, with evidence of a differential treatment effect by centre concluded if the random slopes model leads to a statistically superior model fit.
