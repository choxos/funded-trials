                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with locally advanced disease often require multimodality treatment with surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy is offered to patients with high-risk pathological features postsurgery. While cure rates are improved, overall survival remains suboptimal and treatment has a significant negative impact on quality of life.</p>
                  <p>Cell cycle checkpoint kinase inhibition is a promising method to selectively potentiate the therapeutic effects of chemoradiation. Our hypothesis is that combining chemoradiation with a WEE1 inhibitor will affect the biological response to DNA damage caused by cisplatin and radiation, thereby enhancing clinical outcomes, without increased toxicity. This trial explores the associated effect of WEE1 kinase inhibitor adavosertib (AZD1775).</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This phase I dose-finding, open-label, multicentre trial aims to determine the highest safe dose of AZD1775 in combination with cisplatin chemotherapy preoperatively (group A) as a window of opportunity trial, and in combination with postoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiation (group B).</p>
                  <p>Modified time-to-event continual reassessment method will determine the recommended dose, recruiting up to 21 patients per group. Primary outcomes are recommended doses with predefined target dose-limiting toxicity probabilities of 25% monitored up to 42 days (group A), and 30% monitored up to 12 weeks (group B). Secondary outcomes are disease-free survival times (groups A and B). Exploratory objectives are evaluation of pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, identification and correlation of potential biomarkers with PD markers of DNA damage, determine rate of resection status and surgical complications for group A; and quality of life in group B.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Head and neck cancers are the sixth most common cancer worldwide,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with 12 000 new cases per year in the UK (Cancer Research UK (CRUK) head and neck cancer statistics). The most common types are head and neck squamous cell carcinom (HNSCC) arising from laryngeal, oral cavity, oropharynx and hypopharyngeal subsites.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p>Primary surgery is the standard of care for cancers of the oral cavity, and for more advanced cancers of the larynx and hypopharynx, while chemoradiation is the standard approach to oropharyngeal disease. Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) or postoperative chemoradiation (POCRT) is often recommended in the setting of high-risk features such as a positive margin, multiple involved nodes, extracapsular spread and perineural infiltration.</p>
              <p>The role of concomitant chemotherapy was established by the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy on Head and Neck Cancer in 2009.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This study pooled individual patient data from 93 trials involving 16 485 patients receiving either definitive local therapy alone (surgery or radiotherapy) or local therapy plus chemotherapy (induction, concomitant or adjuvant). Concomitant therapy was assessed in 50 trials involving 9605 patients; chemotherapy decreased the risk of death with an HR of 0.81, translating into a 6.5% overall survival advantage at 5 years as a result of improved disease-free survival. No benefit was seen in patients aged over 70 years. This provides robust evidence that the ability of radiotherapy to secure local control can be enhanced by systemic therapy.</p>
              <p>Acute toxicity and long-term sequelae of POCRT have a considerable negative health impact, and despite intensive treatment, 5-year overall survival is suboptimal at 53%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Locoregional relapse is particularly difficult to salvage, and local control is, therefore, closely correlated with overall survival. Morbidity imposed by local recurrence in the absence of distant metastatic disease is considerable and can be extremely challenging to palliate adequately. There is an urgent need to develop novel approaches that achieve improved locoregional disease control and reduce treatment-related morbidity for this patient group. Achieving this may translate into improved overall survival and an enhancement in patient-related outcome measures.</p>

                <title>Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and DNA damage response</title>
                <p>Cellular DNA damage response (DDR) is central to the preservation of genomic integrity. Cancer development is a multistep process where deregulation of the DDR contributes to phenotypes such as sustained cell proliferation and resistance to cell death. This increase in endogenous DNA damage necessitates the acquisition of compensatory mechanisms if the cell is to avoid death through uncontrolled genomic instability. Importantly, these compensatory changes may constitute a molecular ‘Achilles heel’ that is vulnerable to therapeutic exploitation with a new generation of targeted agents. POCRT exploits the differential DDR in malignant and normal tissues to eradicate microscopic residual disease. Ionising radiation (IR) generates a variety of biological changes within irradiated tissue, with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks being therapeutically significant. IR-induced cell death is also immunogenic, with recruitment of immune effectors to the irradiated tumour microenvironment contributing to a successful outcome.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Platinum-based chemotherapy accentuates IR-induced cell death, in part via the suppression of homologous recombination, the primary repair mechanism for dsDNA damage in irradiated cells.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Manipulation of the DDR pathway, therefore, represents a rational means by which the therapeutic index of POCRT might be improved. Cell cycle checkpoints are integral components of the DDR, allowing the cell to pause progression through the cell cycle to repair DNA damage. Checkpoints are regulated by a network of phosphorylation cascades. <italic>p53</italic>, encoded by <italic>TP53</italic>, is a key regulator of the G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint. <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, which are seen in 60%–70% of HNSCC cases,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> are sufficient to impair the function of this checkpoint and thereby create a critical reliance on the later G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint. In addition, p53 function can be inactivated by various mechanisms, including somatic and germline mutations as well as polymorphisms.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref>
</p>
                <p>Pharmacological abrogation of the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint has been shown to differentially sensitise normal and tumour cells to the effect of DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin and IR.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

                <title>WEE1 kinase and AZD1775</title>
                <p>WEE1 kinase is a key regulator of the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint and a promising therapeutic target. It is a serine-threonine kinase involved in phosphorylation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), the only 1 of 14 similar proteins to be indispensable for mitotic entry. Along with a number of other proteins, WEE1 triggers G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest in response to DNA damage. However, inhibition of WEE1 leads to high CDK1 activity, allowing cells to progress through the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint without the opportunity to repair damaged DNA, leading to potentially catastrophic levels of unrepaired DNA damage induction of cell death.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> WEE1 also has an effect on CDK2 as its inhibition leads to high CDK2 activity and aberrant DNA replication, resulting in stalled replication forks and DNA double-stranded breaks. WEE1 upregulation is seen in a variety of human cancers and is inversely associated with prognosis in some models.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Two separate kinomic screens in HNSCC identified WEE1 expression as a particularly strong determinant of cell survival,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> indicating that HNSCC may be a fruitful setting in which to investigate the clinical effects of WEE1 inhibition.</p>
                <p>Adavosertib (AZD1775) is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of WEE1. It has been shown to potentiate the activity of various chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo. Some studies suggest the sensitising effect is only seen in p53-deficient tumours<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> although not exclusively.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It has also been shown to enhance IR-induced cell death in TP53-mutant cell lines.</p>
                <p>Coexposure of AZD1775 and cisplatin were found to reduce clonogenic survival,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> demonstrating this combination therapy has the ability to overcome cisplatin resistance in HNSCC. Similar effects of this compound on radiation-induced cell death have been seen in models of typically radio-resistant cancer, such as pontine glioma,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> glioblastoma<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Importantly, one study has shown that WEE1 inhibition by AZD1775 sensitises acute myelogenous leukaemia and lung cancer cell lines to cytarabine chemotherapy independently of p53 status,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> suggesting that p53 mutation as a predictive biomarker for response to WEE1 inhibition may be cancer and/or chemotherapy specific. WEE1 has also been implicated in maintaining genomic stability through stabilisation of replication forks—downregulation reduces replication fork speed during S-phase, generating potentially lethal dsDNA breaks.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> By impacting both cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, WEE1 inhibition may potentiate cell death in response to chemotherapy and IR. This suggests that there may be an additive effect on clinical outcome in combination with POCRT, as well as potential synergy.</p>
                <p>AZD1775 is being tested in many clinical settings including in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin in HNSCC (NCT02508246),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> with radiotherapy in childhood pontine glioma (NCT01922076), with temozolomide and radiotherapy in glioblastoma (NCT01849146), and with cisplatin and radiotherapy in cervical cancer (NCT01958658).</p>
                <p>In summary, the available mechanistic data lend strong support to combining AZD1775 with cisplatin and with POCRT in the clinic. Given that the predictive effect of TP53 mutation on such combinations has yet to be clinically validated, this study does not prospectively stratify patients based on any such clinical or biological characteristic. Biomarker data generated, however, will be important in understanding the mechanism of action and informing future combination studies.</p>

                <title>Incorporating AZD1775 into clinical management</title>
                <p>A recent randomised phase III study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a Chinese population with locally advanced resectable oral cavity cancer showed that docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) treatment generated a response rate of 80%, with an exploratory analysis showing that clinical responders had improved overall survival and local control.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> There was no improvement in overall survival for the study group as a whole compared with the control group without upfront TPF chemotherapy, possibly because patients who would ordinarily have received POCRT received PORT alone in this study. In an earlier study, TP53 mutation conferred increased resistance to preoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy in oral cancer.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> While neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yet to find a definitive role prior to surgery, these findings raise the possibility that chemosensitisation may further improve outcomes.</p>
                <p>The preoperative group A sets out to test this hypothesis by combining 1 week of AZD1775 alone, with a second week of cisplatin (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) with AZD1775. This short course of treatment will minimise any delay between diagnosis and definitive surgery and prevent unacceptable delay for the non-responders from getting standard treatment. If this is a promising combination, the long-term aim is to test AZD1775 in the neoadjuvant setting to downstage the disease through treatment with cisplatin and AZD1775 in the preoperative setting, which may decrease the extent of surgery, and may also reduce the need for PORT/POCRT by reducing the involved margin rate. Many patients with tumours that have high-risk histopathological features develop relapsed disease within the anatomical area treated to a high radiation dose. Chemosensitisation and radiosensitisation via inhibition of the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint by AZD1775 has the potential to improve outcomes with acceptable toxicity. This possibility is the basis of the treatment delivered in the group B cohort.</p>

                <p>Primary objectives are to determine the recommended dose and safety profile of AZD1775 with cisplatin in the group A preoperative (window-of-opportunity) setting, and with cisplatin/radiotherapy in the group B postoperative setting. Other objectives: obtain information regarding group A and B disease-free survivals; evaluate AZD1775 pharmacodynamic (PD) effects when administered with cisplatin (group A); identify and correlate potential predictive biomarkers with PD markers of DNA damage (group A); determine the rate of R0, R1 or R2 resection status and surgical complication (group A); and group B quality of life (QoL).</p>

                <p>Wisteria is an open-label, dose-finding, multicentre phase I trial to determine the highest safest dose of AZD1775 in combination with a single dose of cisplatin in the preoperative setting as a window of opportunity trial (group A); and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AZD1775 in combination with cisplatin/radiotherapy in the postoperative setting (group B): both groups recruit and run in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The dose-escalation design is based on the modified time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM),<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–28</xref> requiring a maximum of 21 patients per group, and encompassing up to four dose levels of AZD1775.</p>

Conservative target DLT rates are selected to minimise the likelihood of compromising individual patient’s radical surgery and/or PORT. To maximise recruitment, reduce trial suspension time between cohorts, while balancing safety and optimal patient allocation, screening cohorts of up to five patients will be allowed if the dose has previously been tested. Recruited patients will be allocated to the current recommended dose up to a maximum of five. Patients who become unevaluable may be replaced.</p>

                <p>Group A patients are those with biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, larynx or hypopharynx (having accessible tumours for rebiopsy under local anaesthetic or via ultrasound-guided biopsy), and due to undergo surgery. Patients in group B consist of those already diagnosed with oral cavity, larynx or hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma, who have undergone surgery and are considered at risk of relapse after surgery (ie, with positive margins and/or nodal extracapsular spread). Patients with cancer of the oropharynx will not be included. Since Human papillomavirus (HPV) is only routinely tested in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma or unknown primary of squamous cell carcinoma in the National Health Service (NHS), HPV status was not determined or requested for the tumours as part of the study. Patients who meet the criteria will be supplied with the patient information sheet. If informed consent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendices 1 and 2</xref>) is given, the patient undergoes a full screening evaluation to ensure they satisfy the eligibility criteria prior to registration (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1 B2">boxes 1 and 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>The primary outcome measures are the recommended doses of AZD1775 in group A and group B, and the safety profile of the combination therapy. To be DLT evaluable, group A patients must have received AZD1775 and cisplatin doses scheduled up to and including day 8; group B patients must have received at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. The recommended doses of AZD1775 will be those that have an estimated DLT rate closest to the target DLT rate: 25% for group A; 30% for group B. DLT rates and corresponding 90% probability intervals will be reported. Safety will be monitored in patients treated with at least one dose of the trial treatment until end of follow-up. All adverse reactions, AEs, SAEs, suspected unexpected SUSARs, deaths, deviations and withdrawals experienced by trial patients, throughout the trial’s duration, will be reported separately for group A and group B.</p>

Patients will be followed up for 12 months after which, time-to-event outcomes will be assessed using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Median disease-free survival with corresponding 95% CIs will be reported where appropriate. Further analysis will be performed separately on subsets of group A and B patients who have completed at least 90% of AZD1775 trial scheduled treatments.</p>
                <p>Tertiary outcome measures will be explored and reported descriptively using basic descriptive statistics where appropriate:</p>

The final analyses will be conducted in two parts: (1) analyses of the primary outcome measures of MTDs for groups A and B, to be carried out approximately 3 months after the safety review of the last cohort in each group and (2) longer-term outcomes—including secondary and tertiary outcome measures and updated safety data, to be carried out 1 year after the end of trial.</p>
