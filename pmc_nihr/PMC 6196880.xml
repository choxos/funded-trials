                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>To our knowledge, the comparative effectiveness of commonly used conservative treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome has not been evaluated previously in primary care. We aimed to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of night splints with a corticosteroid injection with regards to reducing symptoms and improving hand function in patients with mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did this randomised, open-label, pragmatic trial in adults (≥18 years) with mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome recruited from 25 primary and community musculoskeletal clinics and services. Patients with a new episode of idiopathic mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome of at least 6 weeks' duration were eligible. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients (permutated blocks of two and four by site) with an online web or third party telephone service to receive either a single injection of 20 mg methylprednisolone acetate (from 40 mg/mL) or a night-resting splint to be worn for 6 weeks. Patients and clinicians could not be masked to the intervention. The primary outcome was the overall score of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) at 6 weeks. We used intention-to-treat analysis, with multiple imputation for missing data, which was concealed to treatment group allocation. The trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2013-001435-48, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrial.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrial.gov</ext-link>, number <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02038452" id="interrefs20">NCT02038452</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between April 17, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, 234 participants were randomly assigned (118 to the night splint group and 116 to the corticosteroid injection group), of whom 212 (91%) completed the BCTQ at 6 weeks. The BCTQ score was significantly better at 6 weeks in the corticosteroid injection group (mean 2·02 [SD 0·81]) than the night splint group (2·29 [0·75]; adjusted mean difference −0·32; 95% CI −0·48 to −0·16; p=0·0001). No adverse events were reported.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>A single corticosteroid injection shows superior clinical effectiveness at 6 weeks compared with night-resting splints, making it the treatment of choice for rapid symptom response in mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome presenting in primary care.</p>

              <p id="para10">Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compression neuropathy affecting the upper limb, which results from entrapment of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Carpal tunnel syndrome adversely affects daily activities, limits work capacity, and impacts on general health and quality of life.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In a primary care population, prevalence has been reported to be 36·08 per 10 000 people, with an annual incidence of 19·12 per 10 000 for men and 35·95 per 10 000 for women.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Classically, carpal tunnel syndrome causes discomfort, paraesthesia, and numbness in the median nerve distribution. Nocturnal symptoms are often clinically significant causing sleep disturbance, and bilateral symptoms occur in more than 50% of patients.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In primary care, diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination findings,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> with electrophysiological diagnostic tests requested by the clinician when a clinical diagnosis cannot be determined and when surgical management is considered for severe cases.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para30">No consensus exists for the best primary care management for mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Mainstay treatments, supported by clinical guidelines,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> include night-resting splints and local corticosteroid injection. In severe cases or those cases that do not improve with conservative treatment, surgery is considered the treatment of choice.</p>
              <p id="para40">Systematic review evidence cites two studies, both assessed as low quality, which suggest night splints might be more effective than no active treatment in the short term.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Trials of effectiveness of splint over other non-surgical interventions in the longer term have not been identified. Systematic reviews of corticosteroid injection<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and a subsequent trial<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> show strong evidence of effectiveness in the short term (&lt;1 month in the reviews and 10 weeks in the trial) compared with placebo, but evidence for the long-term effects is insufficient.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science for articles published from Jan 1, 1980 to Aug 2, 2011 (updated on Nov 6, 2012 from 2008–12). Before this study, evidence for the comparative clinical or cost-effectiveness of night splints and corticosteroid injection in the medium term or in a primary care population was not robust. At the time of designing the INSTINCTS trial (2009–12), systematic review evidence for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome identified only one, small trial, done in a secondary care setting, of head-to-head comparison for two of the mainstay interventions (corticosteroid injections and night-resting splints) used in primary care for this syndrome. A lack of robust evidence of clinical effectiveness beyond the short term for both interventions in any settings was also identified with most existing trials done in secondary care, where patients are likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome that is of longer duration and less responsive to conservative management. No trials had assessed cost-effectiveness of either intervention.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">To our knowledge, our study is the largest trial undertaken to date of corticosteroid injection compared with night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome. We have shown clinically significant short-term and sustained improvements for corticosteroid injections compared with night splints, with no safety issues. This is the first study to carry out a full economic assessment and show that both interventions are relatively inexpensive, with corticosteroid injection proving cost-effective over the use of night splints over 6 months.</p>
                  <p id="para100">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para110">In a primary care setting where most treatment for mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome is undertaken, the evidence now shows that a corticosteroid injection is the cost-effective treatment of choice for rapid and sustained symptom response compared with night splints. These findings provide evidence to support treatment decision making for policy makers, payers (commissioners), general practitioners, and clinicians in musculoskeletal services, and to offer choice to patients.</p>

We did not allow injections into the palm of the hand. Patients were treated by the diagnosing clinician who used a sterile no-touch technique without local anaesthetic.

The splint was fitted according to the size of the participant's hand and arm with standard splints of differing sizes.

Non-responders to follow-up questionnaires were sent a reminder postcard after 2 weeks. Those individuals who did not respond after the reminder postcard were sent a repeat questionnaire after a further 2 weeks. Non-responders to the repeat questionnaire reminders were telephoned by the research nurse, who was masked to the treatment group, to collect the primary outcome measure.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para240">We aimed to detect a 15% greater improvement on the BCTQ from an expected baseline value of about 2·9 points (scale 1–5 [SD 1·0])<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> in the corticosteroid injection group compared with night splinting (ie, a 0·9-point (30%) reduction in the injection group versus a 0·45-point (15%) reduction in the night splint group, with a pooled SD of 1·0 and standardised mean difference of 0·45). Given 90% power, 5% two-tailed significance, and assuming 15% loss to follow-up, 240 patients (120 in each treatment group) were required.</p>
                <p id="para250">We used descriptive statistics (mean and SD or frequency counts and percentages, as appropriate) to summarise baseline characteristics of participants by treatment group and assess similarity of randomised participants with eligible non-participants. The primary analysis was by intention to treat and was done independently by two statisticians, who remained masked to treatment allocation up until the per-protocol analysis. Multiple imputation with chain equations<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> were used to impute missing data arising from questionnaire non-response or non-completion of all items in the questionnaire. Data were assumed to be missing at random. Multiple imputation was applied to all participants randomly assigned to treatment, and the number of imputations was set at 35. Results based on multiply imputed data were compared with those based on complete-case analysis as a sensitivity analysis.</p>
                <p id="para260">The primary between-group evaluation used multiple linear regression to obtain the mean between-group difference with 95% CI in the BCTQ overall score at 6 weeks, adjusting for age at randomisation, sex, duration of symptoms, and baseline BCTQ-score. As a sensitivity analysis, if an imbalance existed in patient characteristics between the treatment groups, the affected characteristics would be further adjusted for.</p>
                <p id="para270">By use of linear and logistic regression models for continuous and dichotomous outcomes respectively, secondary analyses included between-group comparisons of the BCTQ overall score at 6 months, the BCTQ symptom severity and function subscales, and other outcome measures recorded at 6 weeks or 6 months, or both.</p>
                <p id="para280">We did a per-protocol sensitivity analysis based on self-reported adherence to night splinting for at least 4–6 nights per week and use of a single corticosteroid injection. No interim analyses were completed.</p>
                <p id="para290">Potential effect modification was investigated for participants' expectations of the probable response to corticosteroid injection or night-splinting treatments as recorded at baseline and presence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and analysed through adding moderator × treatment interactions to the models estimating the primary outcome of overall BCTS score, to provide exploratory findings regarding subgroup effects at 6 weeks and 6 months.</p>
                <p id="para300">The primary economic analysis was a cost-utility analysis, done from an NHS perspective, to determine the cost-effectiveness of night splints versus corticosteroid injection. Health-care resource use data were obtained from self-report questionnaires at 6 months and these were valued with unit cost data obtained from the British National Formulary,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Unit Costs of Health and Social Care,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and NHS reference costs.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> We also estimated the cost of delivering both interventions (night splints and corticosteroid injections). All costs were valued at 2016–17 prices. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We calculated QALYs over 6 months for each study participant using EQ-5D 5L scores and the area under the curve approach. Imbalances in baseline utility (EQ-5D) scores between the study arms were controlled for with a multiple linear regression approach. Missing cost and EQ-5D-5L scores were imputed with a multiple imputation approach. An imputation model was fitted and included 25 imputed datasets.</p>
                <p id="para310">An incremental analysis was undertaken, with differences in costs and QALYs expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost per additional QALY gained. Bootstrapping was used to quantify uncertainty, and 5000 paired estimates of mean differential costs and QALYs were estimated and presented on a cost-effectiveness plane. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was constructed to show the probability of injection being cost-effective across a range of possible values of willingness to pay for an additional QALY.</p>
                <p id="para320">Sensitivity analysis had four main foci. First, broader societal costs were calculated with the human capital approach to determine productivity losses due to time off work over the 6-month period. Costs of absenteeism from paid work were estimated by multiplying the reported number of days off work by the average daily wage, stratified by hourly mean income according to sex, full-time or part-time work status, and standard occupational classification (2010).<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Second, sensitivity analysis focused on estimating the cost-effectiveness of the interventions from a health-care perspective (including private health-care costs). Third, cost-utility analysis was done with individual-level utility scores obtained with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire mapped back to the EQ-5D 3L valuation set, as recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Finally, cost-effectiveness analysis was done with the BCTQ.

The most frequent reasons for ineligibility were that patients had received corticosteroid injection or night splints in the preceding 6 months (n=117, 26%), had severe carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms (n=54, 12%), and had intercurrent illnesses (n=53, 12%). Of the eligible patients, 234 gave informed consent and were randomly assigned to treatment (58% of 405 eligible patients and 31% of 750 clinical attendees); 118 to the night splint group and 116 to the corticosteroid injection group. The number of participants randomly assigned at each centre ranged from 0 to 36. Demographic characteristics were similar between participants (n=234) and eligible non-participants (n=171): mean age 52·4 years (SD 15·9) versus 53·4 years (14·7) and n=80 (34%) versus n=50 (29%) were men, respectively.

              <p id="para390">No serious or unexpected adverse events were reported. In terms of expected adverse reactions, within the corticosteroid injection group four (3%) participants reported thinning, lightening, or darkening of the skin at the injection site, 17 (15%) had hot flushes, and 53 (46%) had a more painful hand or wrist after the injection, of whom 18 (34%) reported the pain lasting more than 3 days before it started to ease. In the night splint group, seven (6%) were not able to wear the splints as instructed because the splints were uncomfortable. Further adjustment of the analysis of primary outcome for the imbalanced baseline characteristics resulted in negligible changes of the results (adjusted mean difference −0·33, 95% CI −0·51 to −0·16 for the injection group <italic>vs</italic> −0·32, −0·48 to −0·16 for the night splint).</p>

              <p id="para410">For the per-protocol sensitivity analysis, patients whose treatment deviated from protocol were excluded (n=31). In the corticosteroid injection group, three participants were excluded from the analysis as they either received an incorrect injection (n=2) or additionally to the injection wore a night splint (n=1; therefore switched treatment group). In the night splint group, 28 participants were removed from the analysis as they received a corticosteroid injection in addition to the night splint (n=2; therefore switched treatment group), wore the splint on the wrong hand (n=3), did not wear the splint for at least 4–6 nights per week (n=4), or did not provide adherence data (n=19). Therefore, 89 patients in the night splint group and 114 patients in the injection group were included in the per-protocol sensitivity analysis. The results were similar to the intention-to-treat analysis with adjusted mean differences for overall BCTQ scores of −0·36 (95% CI −0·55 to −0·18) versus −0·32 (–0·48 to −0·16; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) at 6 weeks and 0·05 (–0·15 to −0·25) versus 0·06 (–0·11 to 0·23; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) at 6 months.

Similar results were obtained at 6 months for the effect modification (–0·15, 95% CI −0·48 to 0·19) and the adjusted mean difference was 0·13 (95% CI −0·10 to 0·37) for those with unilateral symptoms and −0·01 (–0·25 to 0·23) for those with bilateral symptoms.</p>
              <p id="para430">The exploratory, a-priori defined subgroup analysis investigating effect modification by participants' expectations regarding treatment response showed larger improvements in BCTQ scores were seen in those allocated to the intervention of their preference (n=42, adjusted mean difference −0·52, 95% CI −0·93 to −0·12) compared with those who were not allocated to the intervention of their preference (n=52, −0·12, −0·50 to 0·26). Those individuals who preferred to have an injection showed larger improvements (n=58, −0·60, −0·97 to −0·23) than those who preferred a night splint (n=52, −0·22, −0·60 to 0·16) or had no preference for either treatment (n=128, −0·24, −0·44 to −0·05).

The results show that at 6 weeks, across all primary and secondary outcome measures analysed, a single injection of 20 mg methylprednisolone acetate led to significantly greater improvements in pain and function than night splints and that these improvements were largely sustained over 6 months (with no difference between groups), which is beyond the active life of methylprednisolone acetate. As a result of further improvements in the night splint group, differences at 6 months were small. The more rapid improvement associated with corticosteroid injection also leads to this treatment being more cost-effective from both an NHS and societal perspective. These 6-month results add to the current inconsistent evidence of only short-term comparative effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, we reported only known and expected adverse reactions. Methylprednisolone acetate has been widely used for many years in standard practice in both primary and secondary care and has a very well-established safety profile.</p>
              <p id="para470">A minimally important clinical difference has not been published for the overall BCTQ for a comparison between these two interventions in primary care. We proposed a minimally important clinical difference based on the results of two available primary care-based studies<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> (at the time of the sample size calculation in 2012) that separately investigated corticosteroid injections and splints and were therefore only indicative for defining the threshold for our study. An 11% difference in overall BCTQ scores was achieved against an anticipated 15% difference and a 0·32 effect size against an anticipated effect size of 0·45 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). However, the pooled SD of 0·786 is smaller than the SD used in the sample size calculation (1·0). Dividing the treatment effect (–0·32) by 0·786 gives an effect size of 0·41, which is approximately equal to the standardised difference of 0·45 used in the sample size calculation. Given this and that findings were consistent across all primary and secondary outcomes with a more rapid improvement of symptoms with injection, we feel the results might be considered sufficiently clinically important by patients with mild–severe symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
              <p id="para480">No consensus exists for the optimal dose or choice of corticosteroid to inject for carpal tunnel syndrome. One study based in secondary care<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> found that higher doses of corticosteroid (60 mg methylprednisolone acetate) resulted in more patients being free from clinically significant symptoms than lower doses (20 mg or 40 mg) at 6 months (success of 73% for 60 mg, 56% for 40 mg, and 53% for 20 mg), but there was no evidence of longer-term benefits at 12 months. In a second study, again in secondary care and in patients in whom splinting had already failed, improvements in symptom severity scores at 10 weeks were also greater in patients who received 80 mg and 40 mg of methylprednisolone (difference in change from baseline −0·64, 95% CI −1·06 to −0·21; p=0·003) than in those who received placebo (–0·88, −1·30 to −0·46; p&lt;0·001), but differences were not significant at 1 year.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Our study shows that a single injection of a relatively low dose of 20 mg methylprednisolone acetate (which reflects a consensus regarding usual practice for administering corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome in primary care) produced a more rapid improvement of mild or moderate symptoms than use of night splints.</p>
              <p id="para490">Landmark-guided (also known as blind) corticosteroid injection was used in the trial as this technique is the standard used in primary care where access to ultrasound is usually rare. Unguided corticosteroid injections have been shown to be of similar efficacy to ultrasound-guided injections in reducing symptoms and improving function and electrophysiological findings in carpal tunnel syndrome.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para500">Carpal tunnel syndrome is routinely classified as mild, moderate, or severe, although criteria for this categorisation are not well established and there is lack of an accepted gold standard for diagnosis particularly in relation to the inclusion of electrophysiological tests. In some countries, including the UK, primary care access to nerve conduction studies is variable or limited. As such, these investigations are usually reserved for indeterminate diagnoses and are not always required routinely in primary care for mild or moderate cases to guide decisions regarding initial conservative treatments.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> For the purposes of this trial, we felt it was important to develop a tool to standardise the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome presenting in primary care. A full description of the design of this tool has been published elsewhere.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para510">Strengths of our trial include the large sample size, length of follow-up, and full health economic analysis. To answer our pragmatic research question regarding comparative effectiveness, it was crucial to do the trial in a setting very close to routine primary care. To optimise the generalisability of the findings, maximise recruitment, and achieve realistic recruitment targets, we decided to also recruit from community-based musculoskeletal services, which receive direct referrals from multiple GPs who themselves do not inject patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The characteristics of our trial population were similar to eligible non-participants, which strengthens the generalisability of our findings, with most participants having their first episode of carpal tunnel syndrome with symptoms for at least 3 months. Trial participants and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation, which is common to many trials of non-pharmacological interventions, and was inherent to the research question and pragmatic design of our trial. Limitations of our trial include the absence of a no-treatment control group, or a group receiving both interventions, which is not uncommon in primary care. We felt it was important to offer treatment to all participants consulting for mild or moderate symptoms, and adding a third group would have increased sample size and compromised the feasibility of the trial in a primary care setting. A clinical assessment was not included at follow-up so we are unable to comment on changes in clinical findings. The recruitment period ended before randomisation of the target of 240 participants, which did not compromise statistical power because of high follow-up, but did mean that the block randomisation sequence was not completed, leading to a minor imbalance in the number of participants in the treatment groups (n=2).</p>
              <p id="para520">In summary, a single corticosteroid injection shows superior clinical effectiveness at 6 weeks and is cost-effective over 6 months compared with night resting splints, which should make it the treatment of choice for rapid and sustained symptom response in mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome presenting in primary care. These findings inform evidence-based treatment choices for GPs and clinicians in community musculoskeletal services.</p>
