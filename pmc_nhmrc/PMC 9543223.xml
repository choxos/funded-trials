                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision impairment. This randomised placebo‐controlled trial investigated whether point‐of‐care tools can improve optometrists' AMD knowledge and/or care provision.</p>

                <sec id="opo12970-sec-0002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Australian optometrists (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31) completed a demographics survey and theoretical AMD case study multiple‐choice questions (MCQs) to assess their confidence in AMD care provision and AMD knowledge. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three point‐of‐care tools (online ‘Classification of Age‐related macular degeneration and Risk Assessment Tool’ (CARAT), paper CARAT, or ‘placebo’) to use when providing care to their subsequent 5–10 AMD patients. Participants self‐audited the compliance of their AMD care to best practice for these patients, and a similar number of consecutive patients seen prior to enrolment. Post‐intervention, participants retook the AMD knowledge MCQs and confidence survey.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 29 participants completed the study. At the study endpoint, clinical confidence relative to baseline improved with the paper CARAT, relative to placebo, for knowledge of AMD risk factors, asking patients about these factors and referring for medical retinal sub‐specialist care. There were no between‐group differences for the change in AMD knowledge scores. Considering record documentation for patients with any AMD severity, there were no significant between‐group differences for documenting patient risk factors, AMD severity, clinical examination techniques or management. In a sub‐analysis, the change from baseline in compliance for documenting discussions about patient smoking behaviours for early AMD patients was higher with use of the online CARAT relative to placebo (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.04). For patients with intermediate AMD, the change from baseline in documenting the risk of progression to late AMD was greater among practitioners who used the paper CARAT, relative to placebo (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.04).</p>

                  <p>This study demonstrates that point‐of‐care clinical tools can improve practitioner confidence and aspects of the documentation of AMD clinical care by optometrists as assessed by self‐audit.</p>

              <p>Evidence‐based practice (EBP) is commonly defined as the “conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.”<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> It involves integrating the highest‐quality research evidence, with a practitioner's clinical expertise and a patient's preferences when making healthcare decisions.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), based upon a systematic review of relevant research evidence, intend to support EBP and reduce potential variability in care.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, a range of barriers exists to clinicians' use of, and adherence, to CPGs,<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> including lack of awareness and insufficient confidence in their implementation.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Potentially, some barriers can be addressed by clinical decision support tools that aim to provide evidence‐based information to guide patient assessment and/or management at the point of care.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Such tools may also facilitate communication with patients, to assist with incorporating patients' preferences in the decision‐making process.</p>

</p>
              <p>As major providers of primary eye care, Australian optometrists have a pivotal role in AMD care provision, including identifying and monitoring signs and symptoms of the disease, instituting appropriate management and referring patients for ophthalmological care when required.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> To assist optometrists in managing AMD, several resources exist, including Optometry Australia's 2019 AMD Clinical Practice Guide and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) Referral Pathway for AMD Screening and Management by Optometrists (2018).<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Whilst these resources provide information about recommended clinical examination procedures, AMD severity classification, suggested review periods for different disease severities and the criteria for referral to a medical retinal sub‐specialist, they are not specifically designed as point‐of‐care tools and do not enable calculation of a patients' risk of progression to late‐stage AMD. There is an opportunity to develop AMD clinical decision support tools that are easy for clinicians to understand, time efficient for use in‐office and facilitate communication with patients regarding risk factor modification for shared clinical decision‐making.</p>
              <p>The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate the efficacy of a novel in‐office AMD clinical tool (the Classification of Age‐related macular degeneration and Risk Assessment Tool, CARAT), provided to optometrists in either online or paper formats, relative to a ‘placebo’ tool to support standard clinical care, for improving clinical record documentation and knowledge of AMD care. The main study outcomes were the accuracy of documenting patient risk factors, AMD severity, the calculated risk of progression to late‐stage AMD, advice regarding modifiable risk factors and an appropriate review period, as measured through clinical self‐audit using an online platform, the Macular Degeneration Clinical Care Audit Tool (MaD‐CCAT).<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Changes to participants' clinical confidence and AMD knowledge (based on responses to theoretical case studies) were also evaluated.</p>

Following provision of written informed consent, participants were invited to attend a one‐on‐one videoconference with a researcher (SAG). During this session, participants completed a baseline online survey (Qualtrics Survey Software, <ext-link xlink:href="http://qualtrics.com" ext-link-type="uri">qualtrics.com</ext-link>) to capture their demographics, AMD practice patterns and confidence in AMD care; they also answered multiple choice questions (MCQs) related to theoretical AMD case studies (described below).</p>

                <p>The information captured in the survey included:
<list list-type="order" id="opo12970-list-0002"><list-item><p>Participant demographics: gender, country of completing their optometry degree, year of graduation, therapeutic endorsement to prescribe scheduled medicines (yes/no), average clinical hours worked per week, principal practice setting (e.g., academic, corporate practice, hospital clinic, public health clinic, private practice etc.) and practice location (postcode).</p></list-item><list-item><p>AMD practice patterns: estimated average number of AMD patients seen per week, AMD grading scale used (if any), AMD clinical guidelines used (if any) and retinal imaging devices available at their practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Confidence in AMD practice, on a five‐step Likert scale ranging from “not at all confident” to “very confident”, for: knowledge of risk factors for developing AMD; knowledge of risk factors for AMD progression; asking patients about modifiable risk factors for developing AMD; providing advice to patients about modifiable risk factors for developing AMD; diagnosing earlier stages of AMD; managing earlier stages of AMD and, ability to appropriately refer AMD patients for medical retinal sub‐specialist care.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>Theoretical case studies were designed to assess participants' knowledge of AMD diagnosis and management; the cases considered a range of risk factors and disease severities. Participants were randomly presented with each case study, and were required to answer a total of 26 MCQs covering four clinical themes (i.e., patient risk factors, clinical examination, AMD severity diagnosis and management).</p>
                <p>Participants were then randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three clinical tools (described under subheading ‘Study interventions: AMD clinical tools’) during the videoconference. A researcher not involved in the videoconference and who did not interact with participants (LED), had prospectively prepared concealed, consecutively numbered opaque envelopes for participant randomisation, to ensure allocation concealment. The randomisation sequence was generated using a random number generator (Microsoft Excel, Version 16.39, <ext-link xlink:href="http://microsoft.com" ext-link-type="uri">microsoft.com</ext-link>), with a block size of 15. The masked researcher (SAG) opened the envelope to reveal the participant's assigned clinical tool during the videoconference, and then provided standardised training on how to use the intervention using pre‐recorded presentations (Microsoft PowerPoint, Version 16.39, <ext-link xlink:href="http://microsoft.com" ext-link-type="uri">microsoft.com</ext-link>). The ‘placebo’ tool was used as an attention‐control measure designed for participants to maintain their current practices and AMD knowledge, and to control for any external influences that may have influenced practice behaviours over the study duration (see description below). Participants were unaware of the existence of an inactive intervention in the trial, thus creating a concealed component to the study that was not stated in the plain language statement or in the public clinical trials registry.</p>
                <p>Participants were asked to use their assigned AMD clinical tool for the next 5–10 AMD patients to whom they provided care.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Participants audited these patient records (post‐intervention) and an equivalent number of AMD patients seen prior to enrolment (pre‐intervention), for comparison. Self‐audits were performed using the Macular Degeneration Clinical Care Audit Tool (MaD‐CCAT), described below.</p>
                <p>Participants then attended a second videoconference for a post‐study online survey, to again capture their confidence in their AMD knowledge and care, and to answer the same theoretical AMD case study MCQs. Participants were also asked to indicate their level of agreement, using a five‐step Likert scale that ranged from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”, for aspects relating to their perceived value and utility of both their assigned AMD clinical tool and the MaD‐CCAT.</p>
                <p>Upon completion of all data collection, participants were invited to attend a debriefing session hosted via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, <ext-link xlink:href="http://zoom.us" ext-link-type="uri">zoom.us</ext-link>). During this session, researchers revealed information about the concealment of the ‘placebo’ tool and presented the main findings of the study to participants. This session was recorded and sent to participants unable to attend the scheduled live Zoom session.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigated the utility of point‐of‐care tools for enhancing the optometric care provided to AMD patients, as measured using clinical self‐audit. The study compared two active interventions (clinical tools), delivered in paper‐ and online‐based formats, with a placebo tool designed to support standard care. Relative to those who received the placebo, practitioners assigned the paper CARAT showed greater improvements in confidence in relation to their knowledge of risk factors for AMD development, asking patients about such risk factors and referring patients for medical retinal sub‐specialist care. Data from the clinical audit showed that changes, from baseline, for documenting AMD risk factors, disease severity and use of clinical examination techniques did not differ across any of the intervention groups at the study endpoint. Compared with the placebo tool, practitioners who used the online CARAT showed greater improvement in documenting discussions around smoking behaviours for patients with early AMD. Practitioners assigned the paper CARAT showed higher levels of compliance with recording a patient's risk of progression to late AMD, compared to those allocated the placebo tool. The placebo group showed no changes to their AMD care, except for an improvement in documenting smoking cessation counselling; this finding suggests that the placebo tool successfully supported standard care, as a relevant control to compare the effect of the active tools on AMD care.</p>

                <title>Efficacy of the clinical tools</title>
                <p>Systematic reviews have synthesised evidence from multiple studies to consider the value of point‐of‐care clinical tools for improving compliance to CPGs.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Sutton et al. summarised the potential advantages of using clinical tools to include reducing the incidence of patient adverse events, promoting clinician adherence to CPGs, reducing costs associated with patient management of chronic conditions, including the patient in the shared decision‐making process and improving clinical record documentation.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> However, to our knowledge, no studies have assessed the use of point‐of‐care tools in optometric practice. The present study sought to address this evidence gap, by investigating whether implementing in‐office AMD clinical tools alters the optometric care provided to patients with AMD, as measured by clinical self‐audit.</p>
                <p>As a key modifiable risk factor, tobacco smoking imparts an at least two‐to‐three‐fold increase in the risk of progression to late‐stage AMD.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Therefore, asking AMD patients about their smoking status, and providing advice regarding smoking cessation, is crucial for AMD risk reduction. Use of the online CARAT improved clinicians' documentation of counselling patients with early AMD about their smoking behaviours. Although no improvement in AMD knowledge was quantified with any intervention, as assessed using the MCQ scores for the case studies, most participants felt that the paper CARAT improved their knowledge of AMD risk factors and severity staging. Possible reasons for no significant changes to the MCQ scores include that the sample size was not sufficient to detect a change in this outcome and most participants had less than five years of practice experience (suggestive of relatively current AMD knowledge, as supported by participants' generally high baseline knowledge scores).</p>

                <p>The features of clinical tools that successfully promote clinician adherence to evidence‐based recommendations have been thoroughly investigated. A systematic review by Kawamoto et al. identified features of an ‘ideal’ clinical decision support tool as: (i) automated support, as part of clinicians' standard workflow; (ii) actionable recommendations; (iii) support at the time of decision‐making and (iv) computer‐based support.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The active AMD clinical tools (CARAT) developed for the present study aimed to provide actionable recommendations that could be implemented at the time of decision‐making. The online CARAT was designed to provide semi‐automated, computer‐based clinical care support based on individual patient data entered into pre‐specified fields, whereas the hard copy (paper) CARAT used a flowchart format that the clinician manually worked through to derive relevant clinical information. The present study did not find a particular implementation mode (i.e., paper versus online versions of the CARAT) to be consistently preferable for improving clinical record documentation.</p>
                <p>For the online CARAT, the requirement for clinicians to input patient data manually into a form on a website could potentially have disrupted their clinical workflow, which is known to be an implementation barrier.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>, <xref rid="opo12970-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Bonner et al. developed an online clinical tool summarising general practitioner (GP) cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines that included a patient risk calculator.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> The tool improved identification of patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and supported the prescribing of medications for high‐risk, but not low‐risk, patients.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> This cardiovascular tool had similar content domains to the online CARAT, to assist with risk factor identification using a risk of progression calculator.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> However, unlike the present study, the intended users were involved in the development of the tool, which may have led to a high degree of familiarity with its content.

                <title>Considerations relevant to the interpretation of this study</title>
                <p>Participants in the current study were mostly recently graduated optometrists. Regarding the potential impact of experience on clinical practice, Downie et al. considered the influence of practitioner age on the self‐reported practices of optometrists in relation to smoking cessation counselling and dietary intake advice.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> This study found that younger optometrists, aged 20‐29 years, were less likely to enquire about their patients' smoking behaviours, compared to more experienced practitioners.<xref rid="opo12970-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> It is thus unclear whether findings in the present study are representative of the effect of the studied interventions on the general optometric profession. This consideration could be addressed in future studies that engage a greater breadth of the profession, including more experienced practitioners.</p>
                <p>Data collection for the present study was conducted between December 2019 and December 2020. Over this period there were extended COVID‐19 restrictions and Government‐mandated lockdowns that included optometric care being restricted to urgent and critical cases only in parts of Australia. These factors affected participant recruitment and reduced the number of relevant patients available for the self‐audits. We acknowledge that the study involved a modest sample size (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31) and thus had limited statistical power. A post hoc consideration of the potential sample required for an average effect size of <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.5, using a mixed‐model analysis of variance (ANOVA), indicates a need for 15 optometrists per intervention for 80% statistical power. In view of this, non‐significant outcomes should not be viewed definitively, but rather as hypothesis‐generating findings that can be used to inform subsequent adequately powered trials.</p>
                <p>Further limitations include the duration of clinical tool implementation and audit, based on the number of AMD patients seen following provision of clinical tools. Future studies may consider enrolling more participants and re‐auditing clinical records over a longer period or regular intervals, to better represent the optometry community and assess whether improvements are sustained.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, clinical decision support tools are designed to support healthcare provision by providing evidence‐based information in an accessible format, for use at the point‐of‐care. A novel in‐office AMD clinical tool, the CARAT, was developed and tested to assess whether it supports evidence‐based optometric care. The study found that the use of point‐of‐care tools improved some aspects of documenting AMD management advice, as assessed by self‐audit using the MaD‐CCAT. Incorporating online tools into electronic medical record systems to reduce disruptions to clinical workflow and/or individualised clinician‐targeted training may support further improvements in documentation and knowledge of AMD care.</p>
