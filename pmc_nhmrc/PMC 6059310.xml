                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Optimal glycaemia can reduce type 2 diabetes (T2D) complications. Observing retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (r-CGM) patterns may prompt therapeutic changes but evidence for r-CGM use in T2D is limited. We describe the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining intermittent r-CGM use (up to 14 days every three months) in T2D in general practice (GP).</p>

                  <p>Aged 18â€“80 years, T2D for â‰¥1â€‰year, a (past month) HbA1c&gt;5.5â€‰mmol/mol (0.5%) above their individualised target while prescribed at least two non-insulin hypoglycaemic therapies and/or insulin (therapy stable for the last fourâ€‰months). Our general glycaemic target is 53â€‰mmol/mol (7%) (patients with a history of severe hypoglycaemia or a recorded diagnosis of hypoglycaemia unawareness will have a target of 64â€‰mmol/mol (8%)).</p>
                  <p>Our trial compares r-CGM use and usual care. The r-CGM report summarising daily glucose patterns will be reviewed by GP and patient and inform treatment decisions. Participants in both arms are provided with 1â€‰hour education by a specialist diabetes nurse.</p>
                  <p>The sample (n=150/arm) has 80% power to detect a mean HbA1c difference of 5.5â€‰mmol/mol (0.5%) with an SD of 14.2 (1.3%) and alpha of 0.05 (allowing for 10% clinic and 20% patient attrition).</p>

                <title>Introduction</title>
                <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of disease burden, doubling in prevalence in the last 20 years and costing the global community an estimated US$376â€‰billion in 2010.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Much of this money is spent on lowering blood glucose levels and managing complications. Achieving and sustaining glycaemic targets is important in reducing downstream complications (particularly microvascular) and all-cause mortality.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Yet most people with T2D do not achieve or sustain target glycated haemoglobin (HbA1câ€”an index of average blood glucose level over the preceding 12 weeks),<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> despite a growing range of available medications.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Clinical care in general practice can help people achieve glycaemic targets,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> through adoption of an evidence-based â€˜treat to targetâ€™ approach (stepwise treatment intensification through changes to lifestyle, medication doses and/or prescription of additional medications) as recommended by guidelines internationally.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6â€“8</xref></p>
                <p>A number of factors influence timely treatment intensification.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These include the knowledge, skills and motivation of both general practitioners (GPs) and people with T2D. Both may be concerned by the challenges of deciding on and managing complex treatment regimens. For GPs, â€˜clinical inertiaâ€™ may also be fuelled by concerns about hypoglycaemia,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> while many people with T2D experience â€˜psychological insulin resistanceâ€™, including feelings of failure, to the extent that one in four would be unwilling to use insulin if it were recommended.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
                <p>Current guidelines base treatment intensification recommendations on HbA1c levels,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> and several studies have determined there are minimal clinical benefits of routine â€˜finger-prickâ€™ glucose monitoring.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Indeed, several countries, including Australia, have now restricted the subsidy of blood glucose test strips for people with T2D not using insulin.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, HbA1c alone may not provide sufficient information to guide personalised decisions about treatment intensification. Identifying day-to-day glucose profiles could supplement HbA1c, building both the knowledge and skills of clinicians and people with T2D, providing motivation for treatment intensification, as well as addressing any underlying concerns about risk for hypoglycaemia. Random, adÂ hoc glucose measurements do not provide sufficient detail to identify such glucose profiles.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
                <p>Manual structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (S-SMBG), where people with T2D record blood glucose levels intensively over a short period of time (at set times or in relation to key moments, eg, pre/post meals or physical activity), can enable GPs and people with T2D to identify meaningful glucose profiles.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> One trial tested S-SMBG used on a 3-monthly basis in people with T2D managed in primary care in the USA, identifying clinically significant improvements in glycaemia on a per-protocol analysis,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> accompanied by increased confidence in self-care.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, nearly 50% of participants either withdrew or did not adhere to the manual monitoring protocol,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> suggesting the intensive finger-pricking required (eg, seven times per day for three consecutive days) can be a barrier to the real-world implementation of S-SMBG. To personalise treatment intensification, clinicians and people with T2D need a simple, acceptable, feasible, reliable and effective method of identifying glucose profiles.</p>
                <p>Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another method of identifying glucose profiles. CGM involves measuring glucose levels continuously using an enzyme-coated wire or filament inserted into the subcutaneous tissue. CGM measures interstitial glucose levels through generation of an electrical current when glucose reacts with the enzyme glucose oxidase. Until recently, CGM technology has calibrated this electrical current to glucose levels through finger-prick measurements on several occasions during the day. Recent advances in factory-calibrated technology mean that finger-prick measurements are not needed for some CGM devices. While originally licensed only for adjunctive use, increasingly CGM is being licensed around the world for making treatment decisions, such as adjustment of insulin doses.</p>
                <p>CGM can either be used in realÂ time or retrospectively (also known as personal or professional modes). Retrospective CGM (r-CGM) involves the patient wearing a CGM sensor for a period of up to 2 weeks with the glucose data downloaded and reviewed retrospectively in collaboration with their health professional, to identify day-to-day glucose profiles to guide treatment decisions. For many people with T2D, glucose profiles tend to be reproducible on a day-to-day basis. For these people, intermittent, r-CGM may be an appropriate tool for informing management decisions. The use of r-CGM, particularly when no finger-prick calibration is involved, minimises the burden of monitoring and may overcome a key barrier to engagement. r-CGM can also provide detail about hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, as well as time spent in target range, which are all important to clinical and psychosocial outcomes for people with T2D.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Evidence suggests that unrecognised hypoglycaemia is not uncommon among people with T2D.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Finally, r-CGM can provide insight into glycaemic variability (GV), thatÂ is, the extent to which glucose fluctuates throughout the day. There is growing interest in targeting reduced GV as an independent clinical goal with potential to reduce complication rates.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
                <p>For people with T2D, r-CGM thus offers the prospect of an advance in appropriate and personalised care.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, the evidence base for its use in T2D is currently limited, with mixed findings. Two trials of real-time CGM (ie, unblinded) have been conducted in a select population of adults with T2D using multiple daily injections of insulin : neither resulted in a clinically significant improvement in HbA1c, and while one reduced hypoglycaemia and improved treatment satisfaction, the other did not.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> A retrospective matched cohort study did identify an improvement in HbA1c associated with use of r-CGM (ie, blinded) and called for large-scale prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide definitive evidence.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A small number of RCTs suggest that r-CGM is potentially effective in people with T2D using both insulin and non-insulin therapy regimens in achieving glycaemic targets. However, these trials are generally small in sample size, ranging from 25 to 52 people,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> with short follow-up periods of 3â€“6 months.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> A recently published observational study in India also showed promise in r-CGM for people with T2D, but with only 148 participants, a short 3-month follow-up period and the possibility of selection bias in a non-randomised study, the results need to be interpreted with caution.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Thus, preliminary evidence from small RCTs and observational studies suggests the potential efficacy of r-CGM in people with non-insulin-treated T2D, but larger adequately powered RCTs are needed to study its effectiveness.</p>
                <p>Importantly, glucose monitoring, whether manual or through new technologies, is not an end in itself. Indeed, technology can become burdensome to people with T2D.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Rather, how the information is understood and used is central to its utility, and this requires appropriate education of both the health professional and the person with T2D.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> Use of r-CGM needs to be undertaken collaboratively between patient and GP, with support from Credentialed Diabetes Educators (CDE) and endocrinologists as appropriate. Active participation of the person with T2D in this discussion may lead to improved understanding and interpretation of glucose patterns, informed by the individualâ€™s reflection on their lifestyle habits, as well as improving their understanding of the rationale for treatment intensification to achieve glycaemic targets.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Indeed, prior research suggests that understanding of and engagement with glucose patterns among people with T2D may be a facilitator of treatment intensification.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 32</xref> Both the GP and person with T2D need training to interpret the data, to work collaboratively to plan lifestyle or medication changes and set appropriate goals. The person with T2D needs the behavioural skills to make changes to self-management, and GPs need to work in partnership with them to support self-management. To do so, GPs also need to understand the importance of glycaemic targets and have the skills and confidence to interpret glucose patterns, make appropriate treatment changes and have collaborative discussions with the patient about active self-management of T2D. None of the studies outlined above include substantial educational components of this nature.</p>

                <p>The desired â€˜Check, Chat, Changeâ€™ training components and outcomes described in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> are delivered via a 2â€‰hour training session, for all participating GPs and practice nurse (PN), either on site at the practice or via an online video recording of the training. The training is delivered by a GP with a special interest in T2D and a Registered Nurse-Credentialed Diabetes Educator (RN-CDE) with minimum 5 yearsâ€™ experience. The training content is developed by the GP and RN-CDE, with input from health psychologists with expertise in diabetes self-management and education (JS and JB). Throughout the training session, GPs and PNs will have opportunity to reflect on their attitudes towards glucose monitoring in T2D, test their knowledge about how to apply the r-CGM device, review r-CGM trace data and identify suitable treatment change options.</p>
                <p>Participating people with T2D randomised to the intervention arm will attend an individual face-to-face diabetes education session of 60â€‰min with the study RN-CDE. This will be held onÂ site at the patientâ€™s general practice. This session will include instruction on how to wear the r-CGM device and how to interpret the glucose reports from the device to better understand their blood glucose and how this relates to their diabetes self-management and treatment options. Brief supportive information about the device and about diabetes self-management (as commonly provided in diabetes education sessions) will be provided to patients by the GP clinic staff and the study CDE. Participating GPs also have the opportunity to sit in and observe this session with the first patient randomised to the intervention arm.</p>
                <p>Intervention participants will be asked to wear the r-CGM device for a period of 2 weeks every three months, that is, at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, as well as having an HbA1c taken at those times, and to attend a consultation with their GP and discuss the r-CGM reports. This 3-monthly interval is consistent with clinical practice guidelines about regular, stepwise consideration of treatment intensification. The r-CGM device will be applied at those 3-monthly intervals at the GP clinic (ie, by the GP or PN who have attended the health professional training). Patients and practices will be sent reminders to undertake this 3-monthly monitoring.</p>
                <p>Those randomised to the control group will wear the r-CGM device at baseline but the data will be blinded to both the patient participant and their GP. They will continue to receive usual clinical care. Both GP and patient will, however, be prompted to undertake 3-monthly diabetes reviews consistent with clinical practice guidelines about regular stepwise consideration of treatment intensification. Participants randomised to the control group will also attend an education session with a local CDE (funded by the study if necessary to eliminate financial barriers). We will assist with scheduling this for control group.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the study arm to which their patients are randomised, the GP will be free to refer to or consult with an endocrinologist, CDE or any other appropriate health professional, as part of their usual clinical practice.</p>

                <title>r-CGM device to be used in the study</title>
                <p>The r-CGM device being used in the study is the Abbott <italic>FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System</italic>. The system has three parts: a hand-held reader, a disposable sensor and associated software. The sensor is applied to the upper arm of the person with T2D by the health professional (eg, GP or PN) and activated using the reader. The sensor is worn by the person with T2D for up to 14 days, over which time it records interstitial glucose levels every 15â€‰min, though these readings are not visible to the person wearing the sensor. No additional finger-prick calibration is needed. At any time, the person can return to their health professional to have data from the sensor uploaded via the reader to software on a computer, although at least 5 days of data is needed to generate meaningful output.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> Using the reader, the health professional downloads the glucose data from the sensor in the form of reports summarising daily patterns of glucose levels, called an â€˜ambulatory glucose profileâ€™ (AGP). These are then used to identify glucose patterns, including hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, time in range and GV.</p>
                <p>Evaluation of the AGP output and guidelines for its interpretation have been published elsewhere.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref></p>

                <title>Power calculation, sample size andÂ data analysis</title>
                <p>Based on an individually RCT, stratified by practice, the sample size has 80% power to detect a difference in mean HbA1c of 5.5â€‰mmol/mol (0.5%) with an SD of 14.2 (1.3%)<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and an alpha of 0.05. The required number of participants in each arm is n=108, a total of n=216. Assuming a 20% attrition rate, this inflates to n=270 (n=135 in each arm). Allowing for 10% clinic attrition and assuming six participants per clinic, we are thus aiming to recruit n=300 participants (n=150 in each arm).</p>
                <p>Clinic, GP and patient characteristics at baseline will be summarised for each study group and assessed for imbalance. Mean HbA1c levels at baseline and 12 months will be plotted for each study arm.</p>
                <p>A linear mixed-effects model (ie, with both fixed effect for treatment and time and random effect for clinic and repeated patient HbA1c measurements) will be used to estimate the group difference in HbA1c at 12 months using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. The model will include the HbA1c at baseline, 6 months and 12 months and be adjusted by age and history of hypoglycaemia should these be imbalanced between the arms at baseline. A secondary analysis will examine whether the intervention effect differs between those with and without a history of severe hypoglycaemia. The same approach will be used to determine whether the intervention effect varies for those with a general HbA1c target compared with those with a personalised HbA1c target.</p>
                <p>Analysis will be based on an intention-to-treat approach. Mixed models assume any missing data are missing at random. Hence, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of this assumption. A full statistical analysis plan for the trial will be published separately.</p>
                <p>We will use the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes outcomes simulation model (with updated Australian equations where possible) to perform economic evaluation.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The impact of diabetes on morbidity, mortality, health status and healthcare costs will be estimated for each arm during the trial period and beyond using a model based on risk factors and complications. Health status impacts for the two arms will be incorporated usingÂ EQ5D weights to allow estimation of costÂ utility. The model allows extrapolation from the trial outcomes to downstream events and complications, including estimation of the long-term impact of changes in disease management. Costs of monitoring and education will be sourced from trial administrative databases. In addition, costs associated with the health states (eg, stroke, heart disease) will be obtained from relevant Victorian and Australian data sets. The results of the economic modelling will be presented as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained at trial conclusion and full life expectancy for the r-CGM arm relative to the control arm.</p>

                <title>Monitoring</title>
                <p>We will collect data on the fidelity of the intervention (if GPs have undertaken the training in r-CGM use and interpretation and adherence to the 3-monthly visits through collection of Clinic Assessment VisitÂ (CAV) forms, which also ask if any technical problems have been encountered in relation to the sensor, including local skin reactions). Adverse events may also be reported at CAVs and are collected at follow-up data collection using standard operating procedures. A safety monitoring committee consisting of one GP, one RN-CDE and one endocrinologist will be appointed to review significant adverse events, which includes any episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, and their duration, treatment and outcome.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our proposal tackles an important clinical problem with significant health and cost implications for the 1.1â€‰million Australians with T2D in primary care, half of whom have glycaemic levels above recommended target range. While we chose an evidence-based, clinically meaningful primary outcome (HbA1c), our trial is based on the premise thatÂ novel glucose monitoring technologies provide a potential tool for GPs and people with T2D to visualise blood glucose patterns clearly, enabling them to make evidence-based and personalised treatment choices and plans to achieve optimal glycaemic targets. Below we discuss the key innovative features of our study design.</p>
              <p>We are conducting a pragmatic, individually RCT as it will produce robust data about the true effect of our intervention. We will train all GPs to use and interpret the results of r-CGM, while only half of their participating patients will be using the technology as part of clinical care. The amount of glucose data available to GPs in managing intervention and control group participants will thus differ significantly. GPsâ€™ confidence and clinical skills in T2D management may be enhanced (in relation to treatment intensification, built through seeing the glucose profiles of people with T2D and the effect of medication and lifestyle changes in intervention participants). However, we do not believe significant contamination between arms is likely to occur as the application of any news skills in the control arm will be limited by lack of access to detailed, personalised glucose profiles, which will not be available for control group participants. The 3-monthly review prompts and the 1â€‰hour Diabetes Educator session will be standardised exposures across both arms, enabling us to isolate the effect of the r-CGM device used in the intervention group. We chose usual care as our comparator group as s-SMBG is not currently routine practice in Australia and does not feature in current NHMRC or Royal Australian College of General PractitionersÂ (RACGP) guidelines.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p>
              <p>Personalised use of self-monitoring devices is a burgeoning and rapidly changing field. Automated and seamless data collection and presentation is a critical factor in the usability of such technology. We chose a retrospective, professionallyÂ held CGM technology for several reasons. This first is that people with T2D have relatively stable and simple glucose profiles on a day-to-day basis.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> This contrasts with people with T1D who have more unpredictable glucose profiles with more GV. Thus, people with T1D need real-time glucose data while people with T2D can learn much about their own glucose profiles and the effects of medication and behaviours from retrospective data, and then use that to effect self-management changes. Based on our experience and understanding of the general practice setting, we expect that the clinical use of r-CGM would fit well with existing patterns of clinical practice. Insertion of a sensor is done relatively quickly by either the GP or PN. At a scheduled follow-up appointment, the sensor data can be uploaded easily and viewed in a regular consultation with a GP, and the report format enables easy visualisation and collaborative discussion of tangible self-management changes between the GP and the person with T2D.</p>
              <p>There are now several r-CGM devices available in the Australian market. This study is investigator-initiated, funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and the investigator group has no commercial interest with the manufacturer of these devices. However, we structured our study around the use of an automated device requiring no finger-prick calibration as we believe this is the most likely form and direction that the technology will take in the future, with minimal burden on the person with T2D addressing a key barrier to S-SMBG levels.</p>
              <p>Our study embeds r-CGM technology within a supportive and collaborative educational framework for the GP and PN and the person with T2D. r-CGM needs to be integrated within an educational intervention that promotes and supports patient engagement with possible behavioural changes and treatment adjustments.</p>
              <p>Hypoglycaemia, and in particular nocturnal hypoglycaemia, in people with T2D is significant but commonly under-reported in RCTs (especially in in those on insulin)<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and elsewhere.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> As a pragmatic real-world study, our trial also offers a unique opportunity to gather robust data on the prevalence of hypoglycaemia among a primary care T2D population.</p>
              <p>Limitations of our study are that no independent monitoring has been performed and that serious adverse events were not structurally assessed (ie, reporting was dependent on the clinicians at the participating practices).</p>
              <p>Our study will provide important evidence of the effectiveness of new r-CGM technologies as they inevitably enter the community, enabling rational clinical and health policy decisions, potentially shaping T2D clinical practice in Australia and around the world, with impact on health and healthcare costs.</p>
