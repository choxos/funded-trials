                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The benefits of physical activity for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) are well-known. However, whether established glycaemic and cardiovascular benefits can be maximised by exercising at a certain time of day is unknown. Given postprandial glucose peaks contribute to worsening glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and cardiovascular risk factors, and that exercise immediately lowers blood glucose, prescribing exercise at a specific time of day to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia may improve glycaemic control and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in people with T2D.</p>

                  <p>A single-centre randomised controlled trial will be conducted by the University of Wollongong, Australia. Individuals with T2D (n=70, aged 40–75 years, body mass index (BMI): 27–40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) will be recruited and randomly allocated (1:1), stratified for sex and insulin, to one of three groups: (1) exercise at time of peak hyperglycaemia (ExPeak, personalised), (2) exercise not at time of peak hyperglycaemia (NonPeak) or (3) waitlist control (WLC, standard care). The trial will be 5 months, comprising an 8-week intervention and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcome is the change in HbA1c preintervention to postintervention. Secondary outcomes include vascular function (endothelial function and arterial stiffness), metabolic control (blood lipids and inflammation) and body composition (anthropometrics and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)). Tertiary outcomes will examine adherence.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Approximately 463 million adults are living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and this number is expected to increase to 700 million by 2045.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Individuals with T2D have a twofold greater risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD; eg, myocardial infarction, stroke, etc) and CVD accounts for ~70% of deaths in patients with T2D.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> T2D is characterised by elevated fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Large excursions in blood glucose, especially during the postprandial period (ie, postprandial hyperglycaemia) cause oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which mechanistically links impaired glucose regulation with the development of CVD in people with T2D.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Acute and chronic exercise training improve blood glucose regulation and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. The benefits of exercise training on glycaemic control are largely attributed to the accumulated effects of individual exercise sessions<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> increasing contraction-mediated and insulin-mediated glucose uptake<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> consistently and overtime. The current guidelines for physical activity recommend adults to accumulate ~150–300 min of moderate intensity aerobic activity throughout the week to improve or maintain health,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> including glycaemic control (ie, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)) in people with T2D.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, mounting evidence<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–15</xref> indicates that exercise timing (eg, premeal vs postmeal or morning vs afternoon) influences glycaemic responses, yet there are no consistent guidelines on exercise timing in any current physical activity recommendations globally.</p>
              <p>Multiple systematic reviews have recently examined the effects of exercise timing on measures of glycaemic control in people with T2D and suggest the best time to exercise is within the first few hours after a meal.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> However, performing exercise at different times of the day (ie, morning vs afternoon) has also shown to influence glycaemic responses.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> For example, Savikj <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (2019) recently demonstrated that 2 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT; 3 days/week) performed in the afternoon improved 24 hours glucose concentration by −0.6 mmol/L more than HIIT in the morning,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> whereas a separate study by Teo <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> (2019) found no significant differences in any glycaemic outcomes (HbA1c, fasting or postprandial glucose) after 12 weeks of exercise (3 days/week) performed in the morning versus afternoon.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Given the inconsistent findings and broad recommendations in the current literature (ie, exercise timing relative to time of day or meal consumption), a more personalised approach may be needed to target CVD and for practitioners to prescribe exercise timing for people with T2D. Postprandial hyperglycaemia is linked to CVD and timing exercise to specifically target the largest postprandial excursion (ie, peak hyperglycaemia) of the day may lead to greater glycaemic benefits and reduced cardiovascular risk.</p>
              <p>It is unknown if prescribing daily exercise at a specific time of day, to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia, will lead to greater improvements in HbA1c compared with the current physical activity guidelines of accumulating ~150–300 min/week at any time. Further, the vascular effects of exercising specifically to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia are unknown. The endothelium is a key regulator of vascular homeostasis and endothelial function is an early risk factor for CVD.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Hyperglycaemia increases production of reactive oxygen species<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and the resulting oxidative stress reduces vascular homeostasis (ie, by increasing vasoconstriction and decreasing vasodilation) which can lead to endothelial dysfunction and CVD over time. A longer-term intervention of daily exercise is now warranted to garner a better understanding of exercise timing on glycaemic control and to examine whether exercising at the time of peak hyperglycaemia improves HbA1c and reduces cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
              <p>The aim of this trial is to determine whether exercising to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia (exercise beginning ~30 min before peak hyperglycaemia) improves glycaemic control (HbA1c and 24 hours mean, fasting and postprandial glucose) and reduces cardiovascular risk factors (including lipids, C reactive protein (CRP), vascular function), more than exercising not at time of peak hyperglycaemia (exercise ~90 min after peak hyperglycaemia) or at any time of the day (no prescribed exercise time that is, physical activity guidelines) in people with T2D. The efficacy, feasibility and adherence to prescribing an exercise time will also be explored during a 3-month follow-up. Given that postprandial hyperglycaemia is associated with worsening HbA1c<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and endothelial dysfunction<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> in T2D, we hypothesise that exercising to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia will lead to the greatest improvements in glycaemic control, which in turn will improve vascular function and reduce cardiovascular risk.</p>

                  <p>The ‘Glucose Pattern Insights’ report (automatically generated via LibreView software), for the 2-week preintervention CGM (Freestyle Libre, Abbott), will be used to determine the average time that peak hyperglycaemia occurs for each participant (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). Trained researchers will verify time of peak hyperglycaemia by analysing the raw CGM data using the following methods. After the CGM data is cleaned and separated into full days (ie, &gt;24 hours of uninterrupted data), maximum glucose and the time it occurs will be calculated for each day of the 2-week monitoring period. The average time of day that peak hyperglycaemia occurs will be then determined for each participant—if peak hyperglycaemia occurs at the same time of day (or within ~30 min) on five or more occasions over the 14 days CGM period, that time of day will be identified as the time of peak hyperglycaemia. Alternatively, time of peak hyperglycaemia will be calculated as an average from 14 days of continuous glucose measurements. Exercise for the ExPeak group will be prescribed in relation to the highest peak (ie, greatest glucose excursion); if there are multiple glucose excursions throughout the day with the same peak level, participants will be given an option of the times to exercise, but must stick with one time for the duration of the intervention. Time of peak hyperglycaemia will be reassessed following the waitlist period for participants initially randomised to the WLC group and again in the ExPeak group for the 3-month follow-up.</p>

This technique uses ultrasound imaging (Terason uSmart 3300) of the brachial artery. Following 10–15 min of laying supine (at rest), a longitudinal section of the brachial artery, 2–3 cm above the antecubital fossa, will be imaged using B-mode ultrasound imaging (insonation angle of 60°). A blood pressure cuff placed around the forearm, 1–2 cm below the olecranon process, will then be rapidly inflated to ~60 mm Hg above resting systolic blood pressure for 5 min. Brachial artery diameter and blood flow velocity will be recorded for 1 min before cuff inflation (baseline), ~30 s prior to cuff release (ischaemic stimulus), and 3 min following cuff release (recovery).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> The ~5 min recording will then be analysed with custom-designed edge-detection and wall-tracking software (Cardiovascular Suite, Quipu, Italy) which reduces user bias and increases accuracy.

                  <p>Central arterial stiffness will be assessed via pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements (SphygmoCor XCEL System, AtCor Medical). PWA will be used to measure central blood pressure. A brachial blood pressure cuff will be inflated and the central aortic pressure waveform, derived from pulsations at the brachial artery, will be recorded for 5 s and then automatically analysed through the SphygmoCor software. Key parameters of central blood pressure and arterial stiffness will be determined from the aortic waveform including systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure, aortic pressure, augmentation index and mean arterial pressure. PWV will be measured by holding a tonometer on the carotid artery for 10–15 s, while a femoral blood pressure cuff is automatically inflated. Once fully inflated, the femoral cuff and carotid tonometer will simultaneously record a 10 s capture of the carotid and femoral pressure waveforms. PWV will then be calculated by dividing the carotid–femoral distance by the pulse transit time; the carotid–femoral distance will be calculated by subtracting the proximal distance (distance between the carotid artery and sternal notch) from the distal distance (distance between the sternal notch and proximal edge of the femoral cuff) (PWV (m/s) = (distal – proximal<sub>distance</sub>)/transit time).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Measurements will be performed in duplicate. A third measurement will be taken if the difference between the two PWV values is &gt;0.5 m/s and the average of the three values will be used.</p>

                  <p>This study will be reported according to the CONSORT 2010 Statement and the CONSERVE 2021 Statement for randomised controlled trials. Descriptive statistics will be assessed (means, SD and frequencies), and histograms, Q–Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to identify outliers and test for normality. Linear mixed models (with time × intervention, and main effect of time) will be used to assess differences between groups, for primary (HbA1c) and secondary (CGM, MMTT, vascular function, metabolic control and body composition) outcomes. Tertiary outcomes (eg, adherence to the exercise prescription) will be analysed from the accelerometer and follow-up surveys (Qualtrics<sup>XM</sup>). Attention to treat analyses will be performed for primary analyses (Phase 1) and per protocol analyses will be undertaken for secondary and tertiary outcomes (Phase 2). Data with skewed distribution will be log-transformed or square-rooted prior to the statistical analysis. For the 3-month follow-up, intention to treat analysis will be used and missing data will not be imputed.</p>

This trial was prospectively registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619001049167). Written informed consent will be obtained from all eligible individuals prior to commencement of the trial. Participants will remain anonymous, and all collected data will be deidentified and coded. An alpha-numerical code (stored on a password-protected central spreadsheet) will be allocated to each participant and used for identification on all subsequent paperwork. All results from the study will be published as peer-reviewed articles in international journals, presented at international conferences and promoted through social media.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The primary objective of this trial is to determine if strategically timing exercise, to reduce daily peak hyperglycaemia, will improve glycaemic control and lower cardiovascular risk factors in people with T2D. This is the first study to investigate whether prescribing exercise that is personalised to target daily peak hyperglycaemia, using CGM, can improve cardiovascular risk factors in T2D. Based on evidence from prior research,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 34–36</xref> it is hypothesised that strategically timing daily exercise to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia will improve glycaemic control (HbA1c), and the reduction in peak glycaemia will improve vascular function (endothelial function and arterial stiffness), blood lipids and CRP, more than exercising not at peak hyperglycaemia or control standard care (ie, physical activity guidelines).</p>
              <p>Recent evidence suggests exercise timing may be important to offset circadian rhythms<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and to target postprandial hyperglycaemia<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in T2D. However, there are no recommendations for exercise timing in the current physical activity guidelines (ie, physical activity can be accumulated at any time throughout the week). Further, adherence to the current recommendations is notoriously poor. Regardless of the effectiveness for an intervention to improve diabetes management, findings will only be translatable if patients comply with and adopt to the treatment over the long-term. Therefore, adherence to prescribed daily exercise time (ie, creating more of a habit) will be assessed for 3 months following the 8-week intervention. Exercising at the time of peak hyperglycaemia may improve self-efficacy to the exercise prescription, as results from the CGM data (pre/mid/post 8-week intervention) will allow participants to see the direct impact of exercise on blood glucose levels. Use of CGM in this trial not only offers the distinct advantage of determining time of peak hyperglycaemia, but will also allow us to examine any changes in daily glycaemic patterns, such as glycaemic variability, which are more closely related to cardiovascular risk than HbA1c.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> If strategically timing exercise to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia improves long-term glycaemic control (HbA1c), reduces cardiovascular risk (endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness) and improves exercise adherence then this may be an alternative recommendation for physical activity prescription in people with T2D.</p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This is the first randomised controlled trial to examine the effects of personalising exercise timing to attenuate peak hyperglycaemia (determined via CGM technology) on cardiometabolic and vascular health outcomes in individuals with T2D. This study will be conducted in free-living conditions, with exercise performed at home and contact/delivery of <italic toggle="yes">Phase 1</italic> (8-week exercise intervention) mirroring standard care (five telehealth calls with an exercise physiologist), while <italic toggle="yes">Phase 2</italic> (3-month follow-up) will assess adherence to the exercise prescription (with minimal contact from the research team); thus informing us of the real-world applicability of the proposed exercise prescription. In addition, this study will use a variety of data collection methods (in-lab and free-living) to objectively measure cardiometabolic health, vascular function, physical activity and behaviour change across the trial. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, remote participants from across rural and urban Australia will be included, allowing for a wider range of individuals to be recruited while adhering to the COVID-19 restrictions. However, this is also a limitation as the vascular and body composition measures will be excluded for those who cannot attend university assessments, and dried blood spot testing kits will be used rather than the gold-standard plasma measurement of HbA1c. Finally, a limitation of the waitlist control group is the potential overestimation of intervention effects and bias in favour of the treatment group. Nevertheless, inclusion of the waitlist control group will provide insight on the cause–effect relationship between the intervention and subsequent health outcomes/behaviour changes, as these participants will follow a delayed-start design (ie, will receive treatment following the waitlist period), thus allowing for direct comparisons to be made under various conditions with reduced error variance and not withholding treatment to individuals.</p>
