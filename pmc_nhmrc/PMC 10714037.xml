                  <p>We did a multicentre, open-label, superiority randomised controlled trial in five health clinics in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, patients were excluded if they were younger than 1 year, whereas in Ethiopia patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years. Patients with uncomplicated <italic>P falciparum</italic> monoinfection who had fever or a history of fever in the 48 h preceding clinic visit were eligible for enrolment and were required to have a glucose-6-dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity of 70% or greater. Patients received blood schizontocidal treatment (artemether–lumefantrine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in Indonesia) and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either high-dose short-course oral primaquine (intervention arm; total dose 7 mg/kg over 7 days) or standard care (standard care arm; single dose oral primaquine of 0·25 mg/kg). Random assignment was done by an independent statistician in blocks of eight by use of sealed envelopes. All randomly assigned and eligible patients were included in the primary and safety analyses. The per-protocol analysis excluded those who did not complete treatment or had substantial protocol violations. The primary endpoint was the incidence risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia on day 63.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Aug 18, 2019, and March 14, 2022, a total of 500 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, and 495 eligible patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (246 intervention and 249 control). The incidence risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia at day 63 was 11·0% (95% CI 7·5–15·9) in the standard care arm compared with 2·5% (1·0–5·9) in the intervention arm (hazard ratio 0·20, 95% CI 0·08–0·51; p=0·0009). The effect size differed with blood schizontocidal treatment and site. Routine symptom reporting on day 2 and day 7 were similar between groups. In the first 42 days, there were a total of four primaquine-related adverse events reported in the standard care arm and 26 in the intervention arm; 132 (92%) of all 143 adverse events were mild. There were two serious adverse events in the intervention arm, which were considered unrelated to the study drug. None of the patients developed severe anaemia (defined as haemoglobin &lt;5 g/dL).</p>

                  <p>In patients with a G6PD activity of 70% or greater, high-dose short-course primaquine was safe and relatively well tolerated and reduced the risk of subsequent <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia within 63 days by five fold. Universal radical cure therefore potentially offers substantial clinical, public health, and operational benefits, but these benefits will vary with endemic setting.</p>

                  <p id="para40">Radical cure with primaquine or tafenoquine is currently only recommended in patients presenting with <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria. Before inception of the study a systematic literature review and meta-analysis was done using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify prospective clinical trials in any language, published between Jan 1, 1960, and Jan 5, 2018, that assessed drug efficacy in patients with uncomplicated <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria in countries co-endemic for <italic>P vivax</italic>. The search identified 153 <italic>P falciparum</italic> efficacy studies enrolling 31 262 patients and showed a high risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia after treatment of <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria, particularly in areas with short relapse periodicity and after treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies that are rapidly eliminated. A 2020 individual patient data meta-analysis of 15 341 patients with <italic>P falciparum</italic> confirmed these findings. Prospective trials are required to explore the risks and benefits of providing radical cure to patients with either <italic>P vivax</italic> or <italic>P falciparum</italic> (universal radical cure) in different endemic settings.</p>

                  <p id="para60">This multicentre trial assessed the safety and efficacy of high-dose short-course primaquine radical cure in patients presenting with uncomplicated <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria to prevent subsequent <italic>P vivax</italic> recurrences.

              <p id="para90">In areas co-endemic for <italic>P vivax</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> there is an increased risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia following falciparum malaria, substantially higher than would be expected from the risk of re-infection alone.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Patients presenting with acute falciparum malaria are also likely to have had previous <italic>P vivax</italic> infection<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and at the time of presentation could have either undetected low level parasitaemia or hypnozoites. Both fever and haemolysis associated with malaria have been hypothesised to stimulate the reactivation of hypnozoites resulting in subsequent recurrent episodes of malaria.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p id="para100">Pooled analyses suggest that the greatest risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia following <italic>P falciparum</italic> is in regions of short relapse periodicity and following treatment with rapidly eliminated artemisinin-based combination therapy, such as artemether–lumefantrine.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Since a high proportion of <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia infections have peripheral parasitaemia with sexual stages<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> these relapses have the potential to sustain ongoing parasite transmission. Collectively, these findings suggest that in co-endemic regions there is a rationale for opportunistically eradicating <italic>P vivax</italic> hypnozoites from the liver in patients presenting with uncomplicated <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria, an approach termed universal radical cure.</p>
              <p id="para110">Most endemic countries currently recommend a low-dose regimen of primaquine (total dose 3·5 mg/kg) for the radical cure of <italic>P vivax</italic> malaria, administered over 14 days. This prolonged treatment limits the daily dose of primaquine to 0·25 mg/kg per day to improve tolerability and reduce the risk of drug-induced haemolysis. However, extended drug regimens with treatment for more than 10 days after resolution of acute symptoms are associated with poor adherence and effectiveness.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Several studies have assessed short-course regimens in the expectation that these will improve adherence and therefore effectiveness. In 2022, WHO endorsed a 7-day regimen (0·5 mg/kg per day, total dose 3·5 mg/kg primaquine), which has been widely used for more than a decade in South America.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> However, higher total doses of primaquine offer even greater antirelapse efficacy, and this benefit is apparent in most endemic areas.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> A higher dose regimen (7 mg/kg total dose) given over 7 days (1·0 mg/kg per day) has been shown to be non-inferior to the same total dose given over 14 days (0·5 mg/kg per day),<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and newly developed point-of-care tests for glucose-6-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are now available to guide safer treatment.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The potential to provide radical cure safely with a short-course high-dose regimen of primaquine provides major practical advantages and extending the indication for radical cure to other patient groups at high risk of recurrent <italic>P vivax</italic> has the potential to affect vivax elimination.</p>
              <p id="para120">To better understand the risks and benefits of universal radical cure, we did a multicentre randomised, open-label trial to assess the safety of a high-dose short-course primaquine treatment (total dose 7 mg/kg over 7 days) in patients with 70% G6PD activity or greater and <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria. The trial also aimed to assess the efficicacy of universal radical cure to reduce the risk of subsequent <italic>P vivax</italic> episodes compared with the current standard treatment for <italic>P falciparum</italic>, which entails schizontocidal treatment of blood stage parasites plus a single dose of primaquine to eliminate the sexual parasite stages.</p>

A further 100 patients were recruited in Indonesia and treated with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine.

                <p id="para250">The intention-to-treat population was defined as all eligible patients who were randomly assigned to study groups. In the per-protocol analysis, patients who had substantial protocol violations (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>) or did not complete treatment were excluded. The safety analysis included all eligible patients who were randomly assigned to a treatment group and received any study drug.</p>

              <p id="para280">Between Aug 18, 2019, and March 14, 2022, a total of 1563 patients were screened for inclusion. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the study was interrupted after enrolment was completed in Bangladesh but before enrolment could start in Ethiopia and Indonesia (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). A total of 1063 (68%) patients did not meet the enrolment criteria and 500 patients were enrolled into the study, of whom five were subsequently excluded since they did not fulfil the eligibility criteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). 495 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 246 in the intervention arm and 249 in the standard care arm. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between the two study groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). A high proportion of patients were adults (87%), reflecting exclusion of children in Ethiopia. The median <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasitaemia was 11 920 parasites per μL (IQR 4500–32 400) in the intervention arm and 16 600 parasites per μL (5500–34 600) in the standard care arm. The mean total dose of primaquine given in the intervention arm was 7·2 mg/kg (range 0·9–9·1). All patients completed schizontocidal treatment and 234 (95%) of the 246 patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm had all seven primaquine doses. In the intervention arm, 99% (1660 of 1667) of primaquine doses were provided with food (eg, cracker, biscuits, or banana). One patient in the intervention arm (on day 2) and two in the standard care arm (both on day 0) vomited their medication within 1 h of administration, but tolerated re-administration of medication.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram</p><p>G6PD=glucose-6-dehydrogenase. *Of the five patients randomly assigned but not included in the analysis, three were assigned to the high-dose primaquine arm and two to the standard care arm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="left"><bold>High-dose primaquine</bold><xref rid="tbl1fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref><bold>(n=246)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Standard care</bold><xref rid="tbl1fn2" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref><bold>(n=249)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Site</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Bangladesh</td><td align="left">23 (9%)</td><td align="left">24 (10%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Indonesia</td><td align="left">48 (20%)</td><td align="left">50 (20%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Ethiopia</td><td align="left">175 (71%)</td><td align="left">175 (70%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Age</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Median (IQR), years</td><td align="left">22·0 (18·0–30·0)</td><td align="left">21·2 (18·0–30·0)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">6 months to &lt;12 months</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">1 (&lt;1%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">12 months to &lt;5 years</td><td align="left">6 (2%)</td><td align="left">2 (1%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">5 years to &lt;15 years</td><td align="left">21 (9%)</td><td align="left">34 (14%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">≥15 years</td><td align="left">219 (89%)</td><td align="left">212 (85%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Sex</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Male</td><td align="left">153 (62%)</td><td align="left">159 (64%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Female</td><td align="left">93 (38%)</td><td align="left">90 (36%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Bodyweight</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Median (IQR), kg</td><td align="left">54 (45–61)</td><td align="left">54 (46–60)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">9 kg to &lt;18 kg</td><td align="left">9 (4%)</td><td align="left">10 (4%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">18 kg to &lt;36 kg</td><td align="left">15 (6%)</td><td align="left">26 (10%)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">≥36 kg</td><td align="left">222 (90%)</td><td align="left">213 (86%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left"><italic>P falciparum</italic> parasites per μL</td><td align="left">11 920 (4500–32 400)</td><td align="left">16 600 (5500–34 600)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Gametocyte carriage at enrolment</td><td align="left">24 (10%)</td><td align="left">22 (9%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left"><italic>P falciparum</italic> gametocytes per μL</td><td align="left">48 (31–741)</td><td align="left">300 (64–488)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Body temperature, °C</td><td align="left">37·5 (1·0)</td><td align="left">37·4 (1·1)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Fever<xref rid="tbl1fn3" ref-type="table-fn">‡</xref></td><td align="left">116 (47%)</td><td align="left">108 (43%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left">Haemoglobin, g/dL</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Mean (SD)</td><td align="left">14·2 (2·5)</td><td align="left">14·0 (2·5)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Range</td><td align="left">8·4–21·9</td><td align="left">8·1–24·1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">G6PD activity, U/gHb</td><td align="left">7·2 (6·3–8·1)</td><td align="left">7·0 (6·3–8·1)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are n (%), median (IQR), or mean (SD), unless otherwise specified.

              <p id="para340">A total of 143 adverse events were reported between enrolment and day 42, of which 132 (92%) were mild (grade 1; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Reporting of adverse events varied considerably by site with a low number of events reported in Bangladesh, and higher numbers in Indonesia (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 14–18</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para350">71 (50%) of the 143 adverse events were reported before or on day 7 (54 in the intervention arm and 17 in the standard care arm). Patients in the intervention arm had scheduled visits on days 3–6 in which adverse events were assessed; 29 (54%) of the reported events for this group occurred on those visit days. Patients in the standard care arm did not have scheduled visits on days 3–6 and reported events retrospectively at their day 7 visit; two (12%) of the 17 events reported for this group occurred during days 3–6 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 20</xref>). There were only four adverse events reported to be related to primaquine in the standard care arm and 26 in the intervention arm (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 21</xref>) between day 0 and day 42. 23 (77%) of the 30 related events occurred before or on day 7.</p>
              <p id="para360">One adverse event was reported as grade 3 occurring in a patient enrolled in the intervention arm. The patient was an 18-year-old male presenting with acute gastritis and vomiting on day 5, treated as an outpatient with an antiemetic. He continued his primaquine course and recovered within 5 days.</p>
              <p id="para370">There were two serious adverse events reported, both of which occurred in the intervention arm. The first event was in a male patient aged 24 years who was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pain on day 7, after completing primaquine treatment. He had been taking non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for several years for myalgia after physical activity. The event was considered to be possibly related to the study drug compounded by underlying gastritis. The patient made a rapid recovery and was discharged the following day. The second event was in a male patient aged 45 years who presented with abdominal pain on day 25 and signs of sepsis, both of which were considered to be unrelated to the study drug. He was treated with ciprofloxacin, analgesia, and intravenous fluids in hospital. He made a rapid recovery and was discharged the following day.</p>
              <p id="para380">The mean haemoglobin concentration at enrolment was 14·1 g/dL (SD 2·5, range 8·1 to 24·2) and was similar between treatment arms. The mean haemoglobin fell to 12·6 g/dL in the intervention arm and to 12·7 g/dL in the standard care arm on day 2 and was 13·5 g/dL in the intervention arm and 13·9 g/dL in the standard care arm on day 7. On day 2 the unadjusted mean absolute change in haemoglobin relative to baseline was –0·5 g/dL (range –4·6 to –4·4) in the standard care arm and –0·3 g/dL (–9·2 to 5·7) in the intervention arm. By day 7, the unadjusted mean absolute change in haemoglobin relative to baseline was –0·1 g/dL (–5·6 to 6·4) in the standard care arm and –0·7 g/dL (–6·9 to 8·7) in the intervention arm (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 23</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para390">None of the patients developed severe anaemia (haemoglobin of &lt;5 g/dL; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). By day 7, two patients in the standard care arm and two patients in the intervention arm had a reduction in haemoglobin of 25% or more and had developed moderately severe anaemia (&lt;7 g/dL). Three of these patients (two in the intervention arm and one in the standard care arm) reported haemoglobinuria. Only one of these patients (in the standard care arm) was symptomatic and reported dizziness but no shortness of breath. All patients continued their treatment without interruption, no patient required a blood transfusion, and they all recovered fully by day 63 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 24</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para400">This multicentre, open-label, superiority randomised trial provides prospective evidence of the efficacy of universal radical cure across different epidemiological settings. In patients presenting with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, high-dose short-course primaquine treatment (total dose 7 mg/kg over 7 days) was safe and relatively well tolerated and reduced the risk of subsequent <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia within 63 days by five-fold. Radical cure is likely to continue to offer protection after day 63 meaning that these efficacy estimates are probably conservative.</p>
              <p id="para410">However, there was marked heterogeneity between sites. In the standard care arm, the risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia during follow-up was 12·7% in Ethiopia, 16·9% in Bangladesh, and 2·2% in Indonesia. This heterogeneity might reflect the prolonged post-treatment prophylaxis afforded by the slowly eliminated dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, which is used for blood stage activity in Indonesia, compared with artemether–lumefantrine, which was used in Ethiopia and Bangladesh. The corresponding absolute reduction in the risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> following high-dose primaquine was 10·3% following artemether–lumefantrine, but only 2·3% following dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Alternatively, the site differences could be explained by differing transmission intensity and corresponding hypnozoite burden, which are particularly low in the Indonesian study site.</p>
              <p id="para420">The absolute risks of <italic>P vivax</italic> parasitaemia following <italic>P falciparum</italic> were also considerably lower than expected from a previous pooled analysis,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> in which a risk of nearly 40% was reported in patients. This result is probably a reflection of the decreasing burden of malaria at all three sites, resulting in a reduction of the risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> infection after <italic>P falciparum</italic> infection. A longitudinal analysis of patients from the Thailand–Myanmar border from 2003 to 2010 showed that the risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> recurrence after initial <italic>P falciparum</italic> infection fell from more than 20% in 2003 to less than 5% in 2010.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Universal radical cure is therefore likely to have a greater effect on <italic>P vivax</italic> recurrences in highly endemic areas and areas with high relapse periodicity. Evidence from a cluster-randomised trial<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> comparing supervised versus unsupervised provision of universal radical cure in Papua, Indonesia, where malaria is highly endemic, showed more than a 60% reduction in the risk of <italic>P vivax</italic> 6 months after supervised radical cure treatment compared with unsupervised radical cure.</p>
              <p id="para430">The most recent WHO antimalarial treatment guidelines include a recommendation against high-dose short-course primaquine, citing concerns over serious adverse events at this higher daily dosage including gastrointestinal tolerability.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Increased gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported with higher daily doses of primaquine in previous trials,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> but tolerability can be mitigated by ingestion of primaquine with food.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Patients in our trial were explicitly advised to take their medication with food such as crackers, biscuits, or bananas and these were provided by study staff. All but seven of the 1667 primaquine doses in the intervention arm were taken with food and were generally well tolerated. Based on the symptom checklist done on day 2 and day 7, gastrointestinal symptoms, such as loss of appetite, occurred in nearly 40% of patients and this result was similar between patients receiving high daily doses of primaquine in the intervention arm and single low-dose primaquine in the standard care arm. However, there were a greater number of adverse events reported in the intervention group. The proportional increase of adverse events between treatment arms mainly arose on days 3–6 and these events were generally mild (ie, grade 1). During this period, patients in the intervention arm were seen for supervised treatment, whereas those in the standard care arm reported events for those days in retrospect on day 7, meaning that the standard care arm might be confounded by recall bias.</p>
              <p id="para440">Although co-administration of high-dose primaquine with food is likely to have mitigated the risks of gastrointestinal intolerability, one of the two serious adverse events occurred after the last day of treatment, requiring hospital admission. The event occurred 1 day after completion of treatment and was attributed to underlying chronic gastritis, although this could have been exacerbated by high-dose primaquine. Wider scale roll-out of high-dose primaquine should include caution in patients with premorbid gastrointestinal conditions.</p>
              <p id="para450">The greatest concern for the introduction of shorter more effective radical cure options is that of severe haemolysis in individuals with low G6PD activity.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> In our study, patients were only enrolled if they had enzyme activity of 70% or greater. This conservative cut-off was chosen because the risk–benefit ratio of a high primaquine dose is likely to be different in this patient population compared with patients who receive radical cure traditionally. Reassuringly, in patients with a G6PD activity of 70% or greater, high-dose primaquine was well tolerated with no reported haemolytic adverse events. The reduction in haemoglobin was similar between groups, and was probably driven by the acute falciparum parasitaemia rather than the drug.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para460">There are substantial logistical challenges in delivering malaria radical cure safely and effectively.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> A novel quantitative G6PD testing option (STANDARD G6PD, SD Biosensor) is now available to screen patients at the point of care and identify individuals with intermediate and severe enzyme deficiency<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and is being rolled out in several vivax-endemic countries.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This roll-out allows the wider scale use of tafenoquine and enables the use of higher and more effective doses of primaquine, including broadening the indication for radical cure to those at risk of relapse.</p>
              <p id="para470">Our study has several limitations. First, the study was powered for the overall sample size but not for site-specific analyses. The recruited sample sizes in Bangladesh and Indonesia were small and the primary endpoint was mainly driven by the Ethiopian site, meaning that generalisation of potential benefits of universal radical cure to different endemic settings should be done with caution. Second, the study was not double-blinded and patients in the intervention arm had more visits than those in the standard care arm, which could have contributed to an observation bias for the tolerability assessment, resulting in an increased reporting of adverse events in the intervention arm. Reassuringly, routine questionnaires on day 2 and day 7 highlighted minimal differences between treatment arms. Third, there are no reliable methods to distinguish whether a patient's recurrent infection arises from recrudescence, re-infection, or relapse.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para480">Universal radical cure confers substantial individual, public health, and operational benefits in regions co-endemic for <italic>P falciparum</italic> and <italic>P vivax,</italic> and this benefit is likely to be greatest in areas of higher endemicity and in countries using artemisinin-based combination therapies, which have low post-treatment prophylaxis, such as artemether–lumefantrine. Many countries endemic for <italic>P vivax</italic> have set ambitious goals to eliminate the parasite within their borders by 2030. Elimination will require wide-scale provision of safer and more effective antimalarial radical cure, with both passive and active case detection. Opportunistically targeting patient populations with a high likelihood of occult hypnozoite carriage, such as patients presenting with <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria, has the potential to eliminate hidden reservoirs of infection and accelerate elimination.</p>
