                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Asthma exacerbations in pregnancy are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. We aimed to determine whether fractional exhaled nitric oxide (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>)-based asthma management improves perinatal outcomes compared to usual care.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The Breathing for Life Trial was a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in six hospital antenatal clinics, which compared asthma management guided by <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> (adjustment of asthma treatment according to exhaled nitric oxide and symptoms each 6–12 weeks) to usual care (no treatment adjustment as part of the trial). The primary outcome was a composite of adverse perinatal events (preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), perinatal mortality or neonatal hospitalisation) assessed using hospital records. Secondary outcomes included maternal asthma exacerbations. Concealed random allocation, stratified by study site and self-reported smoking status was used, with blinded outcome assessment and statistical analysis (intention to treat).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases affecting pregnancy. Worldwide, 8–12% of pregnant women have asthma [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and exacerbations requiring medical intervention affect 20–45% of these women [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Asthma, and exacerbations in particular, are associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A meta-analysis showed that women with asthma exacerbations during pregnancy were three times more likely to have a low birthweight baby (relative risk 3.02, 95% CI 1.87–4.89) compared to women with asthma but without exacerbations [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Women with asthma were more likely to have a preterm birth than women without asthma [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; the risk further increased among women using oral corticosteroids (OCS) for exacerbations in pregnancy [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is an increased risk of perinatal mortality and neonatal hospitalisation, with maternal asthma [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Active asthma management mitigates adverse outcomes including preterm birth [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], leading us to hypothesise that improvements in asthma management may also improve other perinatal outcomes.</p>
              <p>Few studies have tested interventions to improve outcomes among pregnant women with asthma [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our previous trial, the Managing Asthma in Pregnancy (MAP) study, tested asthma management with treatment adjustment using an objective marker of eosinophilic lung inflammation (fractional exhaled nitric oxide (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>)), among 220 nonsmoking women [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Women were randomised by 22 weeks’ gestation to a control algorithm, which adjusted asthma treatment monthly based on symptoms, or a <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based algorithm, which adjusted inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment monthly based on <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>, and added long-acting β-agonist (LABA) when symptoms remained uncontrolled. Women in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group had a longer exacerbation-free interval, 50% fewer exacerbations and were more likely to be prescribed ICS (or ICS/LABA), but at a lower mean dose [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Perinatal outcomes showed trends towards improvements in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group, <italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic> reduced neonatal hospitalisation (8% <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group, 17% control group), although the trial was not powered for perinatal differences. Follow-up identified reduced parent-reported recurrent bronchiolitis in infancy [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and less doctor-diagnosed asthma at preschool age in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-group compared to the control group [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Prior literature and these data led to our hypothesis that by reducing maternal exacerbations, asthma management using a <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-guided algorithm would improve perinatal outcomes among women with asthma.</p>

                <title>Study subjects and study design</title>
                <p>The Breathing for Life Trial (BLT) was a multicentre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial (RCT) (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier ACTRN12613000202763) [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pregnant women were recruited from six Australian public hospital antenatal clinics (7 March 2013 to 11 June 2019). Participants had doctor-diagnosed asthma as used previously in research trials [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], symptoms of asthma and/or asthma medication use (prior 12 months), were aged ≥18 years and between 12 and &lt;23 completed weeks’ gestation at randomisation. Exclusion criteria were chronic lung disease other than asthma, use of OCS &gt;14 days in the past 3 months, concomitant chronic illness which may affect participation, inability to perform <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> or spirometry (due to medical contraindication), drug or alcohol dependence or inability to attend regular study visits. All women gave written informed consent prior to participation. Ethics approval was from the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC; 12/10/17/3.04) and Australian Capital Territory Health HREC (ETH.11.15.232).</p>
                <p>Concealed random allocation randomised women in equal numbers to the control or intervention (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>) group using a computer-generated randomisation schedule (blocks of four or six), stratified by study site and self-reported smoking. Participants and research staff could not be blinded, due to the differing number of study visits for each group. However, primary outcome assessment and statistical analysis were conducted blind to treatment allocation.</p>

                <title>Baseline and outcome measures for all participants</title>
                <p>We collected baseline data on maternal age, height, weight, ethnicity, asthma history, symptoms and medication use, lung function by spirometry and exhaled carbon monoxide (ECO), as described previously (<ext-link xlink:href="http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00298-2022.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri">supplementary material</ext-link>) [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Women were considered current smokers if they self-reported smoking, or ECO ≥10 ppm. Socioeconomic status was determined from residential postcode and the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], expressed as quintiles; quintile 1 represents areas of most disadvantage. Asthma control was categorised as well controlled, partly controlled or uncontrolled according to Global Initiative for Asthma criteria [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], using data on asthma symptoms and short acting β<sub>2</sub>-agonist (SABA) use in the previous week.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome was a composite of four adverse perinatal events: preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks’ gestation), small for gestational age (SGA; birthweight &lt;10th centile adjusted for sex, parity, maternal height, weight and ethnicity using the Gestation Network calculator (<ext-link xlink:href="http://gestation.net" ext-link-type="uri">http://gestation.net</ext-link>)), perinatal mortality (stillbirth ≥20 weeks’ gestation, or neonatal death within the first month) or neonatal hospitalisation at birth (neonatal intensive care unit (level III) or special care nursery (level II)). Pregnancies ending in miscarriage (&lt;20 weeks’ gestation) were excluded from analyses. Secondary outcomes included each component of the composite, birthweight and maternal asthma exacerbations (hospitalisation; hospitalisation/emergency department presentation; and exacerbations requiring medical intervention including hospitalisation, emergency department presentation, OCS use, unscheduled doctor visits).</p>
                <p>Perinatal outcomes were ascertained from medical records by a blinded outcome assessor. Maternal exacerbations were assessed by self-report (2–6 weeks post-partum) and verified by medical record review where possible. Women reported the date of exacerbation events and treatment changes required. Exacerbations separated by ≥7 days were counted as separate events.</p>

                <p>In both groups, brief asthma self-management education was provided by the research nurse/midwife, including assessment and correction of inhaler technique, assessment and discussion of medication knowledge, assessment of written asthma action plan and discussion of asthma triggers [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A consumer-focused pamphlet on asthma in pregnancy was provided [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A letter to the woman's general practitioner informed them of the woman's participation in the trial and women in both groups continued with separate and usual antenatal care.</p>
                <p>Women in the control group received no treatment changes as part of the trial.</p>

                <title>Intervention in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group</title>
                <p>Women randomised to the intervention group also received <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based asthma management for the remainder of pregnancy. Women attended visits every 3–6 weeks during pregnancy aligned with antenatal appointments, where self-management education was reinforced, and asthma control, lung function and <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> assessed. Asthma treatment was adjusted at the first visit, and every second visit thereafter (every 6–12 weeks) and medication provided free of charge, dispensed from the hospital pharmacy. Women received an equivalent dose of budesonide or budesonide/eformoterol (<ext-link xlink:href="http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00298-2022.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri">supplementary table S1</ext-link>), due to budesonide's better safety rating in pregnancy. <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> was used to adjust ICS dose (when levels were above the high cut-point, ICS dose was increased, while ICS dose was decreased when levels were below the low cut-point), while LABA was added when symptoms based on the ACQ (ACQ7/ACQ6 &gt;1.5) [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] remained uncontrolled, unless <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> was high, when only the ICS dose was adjusted (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> treatment algorithm and <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> cut-points were derived from pilot data from pregnant women with asthma, as described previously [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> was measured and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score calculated. We used the seven-item questionnaire, or the six-item questionnaire if quality spirometry results could not be obtained (minimum score of 0, maximum score of 6 [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; scores &gt;1.5 indicate uncontrolled asthma) [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Results were entered into an application on an iPad along with smoking status and current treatment. Current treatments were converted into the equivalent doses of Pulmicort or Symbicort (<ext-link xlink:href="http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00298-2022.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri">supplementary table S1</ext-link>) and then the algorithm was applied to give the new treatment. a) Current treatment options are presented horizontally and the treatment decision options vertically. Arrows and highlighted cells correspond to the treatment adjustment example in panel b). b) Clinical example showing screenshots from the iPad algorithm. The participant was initially using Flixotide (fluticasone propionate) 100 μg twice per day (total inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose 200 μg·day<sup>−1</sup>). At the first visit, this was theoretically converted to an equivalent of 400 μg·day<sup>−1</sup> of Pulmicort (budesonide, initial study drug; yellow arrow). The subject was a nonsmoker, with a <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> of 20 ppb (“mid”), and an ACQ score of 1.57 (“high”). The algorithm suggested a treatment change of “increase LABA”, resulting in a new treatment of Symbicort 400/12 μg·day<sup>−1</sup> (400 μg of the ICS budesonide, 12 μg of the LABA e-formoterol, study drug), which was prescribed from the first visit.

                <p>The required sample size was calculated for a likelihood ratio test for two independent proportions [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To demonstrate a reduction in the composite adverse perinatal outcome from 35.3% in the control group to 26.2% in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group (90% power, 0.05 significance), 539 women per group were required. Allowing for 10% attrition, we aimed to recruit 600 women per group (<ext-link xlink:href="http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00298-2022.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri">supplementary material</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata (version 15; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, using two-sided tests, with p&lt;0.05 considered significant. We conducted complete case analyses, assuming data were missing completely at random, due to low missing data rates.</p>
                <p>For binary outcomes, intervention effects were estimated as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression adjusted for study site and baseline maternal smoking. For perinatal mortality, Firth's penalised maximum likelihood was used to estimate the intervention effect due to low event counts. For the continuous, symmetrically distributed outcome of birthweight, intervention effects were estimated as β-coefficients with 95% confidence intervals using linear regression adjusted for study site and baseline smoking status.</p>
                <p>For exacerbation outcomes intervention effects were estimated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals, using negative binomial regression due to overdispersion. Poisson regression was used to determine group differences in OCS count, unscheduled doctor visits, hospital admission and emergency department presentation. Time to first exacerbation was compared between groups using Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox regression. All models adjusted for study site and baseline smoking status.</p>
                <p>Medication use, dose and adherence, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> and ACQ were analysed using generalised linear mixed models with random intercepts.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This is the first RCT to test the effect of an asthma management intervention, with a perinatal primary outcome. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome or its components (preterm birth, SGA, neonatal hospitalisation or perinatal mortality), or birthweight between groups, which were numerically higher in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group. There was no significant effect of the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based management algorithm on maternal asthma exacerbations, compared to usual care, which were numerically lower in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group.</p>
              <p>Women in BLT had a lower incidence of the primary outcome than expected from pilot data, and comparison to national data [<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] suggests that further improvements in individual perinatal outcomes may have been difficult. In particular, the rate of adverse perinatal outcomes in the control group was lower than anticipated, despite relatively little contact with this group (one visit only, no treatment recommendations made). In pilot data, 35.3% of women with asthma managed by a symptoms-based algorithm had an adverse perinatal outcome, with BLT being powered to detect a reduction to 26.2% with <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based management. However, in this trial, only 25.6% of the control group had the adverse outcome.</p>
              <p>The numerically higher rates of adverse outcomes in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group compared to the control group was unexpected. The <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group had more study visits than the control group, which would be expected to improve health outcomes in a trial context. A significant body of literature indicates that women with asthma are at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and that exacerbations are associated with further increased risks for these outcomes [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Data from meta-analyses indicated that active asthma management may mitigate some perinatal risks [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, we hypothesised that an intervention which reduced exacerbations in pregnancy may also improve perinatal outcomes. Since the nonsignificant reduction in exacerbations in BLT was not associated with a reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes (and at one study site a reduction in exacerbations was associated with more adverse perinatal outcomes; <ext-link xlink:href="http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.00298-2022.figures-only#fig-data-supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri">supplementary material</ext-link>), additional mediators may be involved in the relationship between exacerbations and perinatal outcomes.</p>
              <p>The proportion of pregnant women with asthma exacerbations was nonsignificantly lower in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group compared to the control group, which therefore should not explain the perinatal findings. However, the overall prevalence of 17.6% of women having an exacerbation requiring medical intervention was lower than previously observed in our MAP study (33.2%) [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In BLT, exacerbation data were not collected prospectively due to the different number of study visits between groups. Rather, all women were asked to recall exacerbations at a phone call made 2–6 weeks post-partum; this outcome measure was likely subject to recall bias, and more likely to capture severe events.</p>
              <p>It is possible that “usual” clinical care in BLT was more effective in controlling asthma exacerbations than asthma management guided by symptoms only in the MAP study [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Women in BLT had poor asthma self-management skills, and correction of these, such as improved inhaler technique and adherence, could have led to better asthma control in the whole study population. Information provided to participants indicated that asthma should be reviewed frequently in pregnancy and ICS treatment should not be stopped, which may have influenced the control group's exacerbation rate. The reduction in exacerbations due to the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> intervention was much less than expected (from 19% in the control group to 16% in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group), compared to our previous prospective observation (MAP Study; from 41% in the control group to 25% in the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group) [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>While the pregnancy-specific <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> cut-points used in BLT were the same as those in MAP, there were differences which may have affected our results, particularly for exacerbations. The MAP control algorithm was probably different from current usual care, and in BLT, the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based treatment algorithm was only applied every 6–12 weeks, rather than monthly (MAP). Pregnancy is a relatively short time period when asthma symptoms are known to be variable [<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and monthly treatment change (particularly the first two treatment changes [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) may have been crucial to the success of MAP in reducing exacerbations [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Differences in asthma symptoms during pregnancy have been noted at 4-weekly intervals regardless of worsening or improvement overall [<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Pregnancy-specific [<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and general asthma guidelines [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] recommend asthma be monitored every 4–6 weeks due to the variable, unpredictable nature of asthma during pregnancy. Less frequent treatment change in BLT may have resulted in a less effective <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based management algorithm. However, asthma guidelines recommend that decreases in ICS dose should only be considered after 3 months of stable asthma [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study does not support the implementation of <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based management into antenatal care for the purpose of improving perinatal outcomes. However, there remains a need for improvements in asthma management in pregnancy. We observed poor baseline self-management skills among pregnant women with asthma, including &lt;15% with a written asthma action plan, suggesting that guideline recommendations are not being followed in practice. In addition, pregnant women with asthma have concerns about medication use and their potential effects on the fetus [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], necessitating specific education on medication safety and the importance of ICS adherence for this population.</p>
              <p>Particular asthma phenotypes may be influenced more by <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based asthma management than others. A primary care study showed that adults with low <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> (&lt;25 ppb) were most likely to benefit, as it was possible to downtitrate their medication without loss of asthma control [<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the MAP study, women with noneosinophilic asthma had a significant reduction in exacerbations with <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based management [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further work is needed to define the phenotypes or subgroups most responsive to the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based approach in pregnancy, or whether there is the possibility of harm with this approach, and the potential mechanisms involved.</p>
              <p>There were strengths to the BLT's study design. Primary outcome data were obtained for 98% of participants; were validated by an independent, specialist obstetrician; and data collection and analysis were blinded to intervention group. The trial took a pragmatic approach to address potential obstacles to implementation in clinical practice. The trial addressed generalisability of the approach, being conducted in six centres that differed by location, proportion of smoking and obese women, maternal age and education attainment, asthma severity, ethnic background and socioeconomic status. BLT assessed the effectiveness of <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-based management against usual care, an important comparison to engage relevant stakeholders. The trial addressed cost and feasibility issues by simplifying the management approach in several ways. The number of drug formulations available was reduced, the algorithm results were generated electronically, asthma assessments were aligned with antenatal appointments and there were fewer treatment changes. There were several limitations: we did not collect end-of-study data on asthma outcomes, including medication use in the control group; women in the control group had to buy their own medication, whereas the <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub> group received free medication; and we collected exacerbation data retrospectively.</p>
              <p>In pregnant women with asthma, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>ENO</sub>-guided pharmacotherapy delivered by a nurse or midwife in the antenatal clinic setting did not improve perinatal outcomes. Further work is needed to optimise the treatment algorithm if it is to be pursued as a management approach in pregnancy.</p>
