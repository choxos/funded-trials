                  <p id="Par2">Twenty-eight community-dwelling women with painful hallux valgus will be randomised to receive either a multifaceted, non-surgical intervention (footwear, foot orthoses, foot exercises, advice, and self-management) or advice and self-management alone. Outcome measures will be obtained at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The primary outcome is feasibility, which will be evaluated according to demand, acceptability, adherence, adverse events, and retention rate. Limited efficacy testing will be conducted on secondary outcome measures including foot pain (the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire), foot muscle strength (hand-held dynamometry), general health-related quality of life (the Short Form-12), use of cointerventions, and participants’ perception of overall treatment effect. Biomechanical testing will be conducted at baseline to evaluate the immediate effects of the footwear/orthotic intervention on pressure beneath the foot and on the medial aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and hallux.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par14">Hallux valgus is a common and disabling condition characterised by the lateral deviation of the hallux towards the lesser toes. A systematic review of population-based studies (total 496,957 participants) reported pooled prevalence estimates of 23% in people aged 18 to 65 years and 36% in people aged over 65 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], with women twice as likely to be affected. The progressive subluxation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and formation of an osseus prominence on the medial aspect of the first metatarsal leads to crowding and deformity of the lesser toes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], abnormal gait patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], impaired balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], difficulties with finding comfortable footwear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], an increased risk of falls in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and decreased health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">The impact of hallux valgus on the healthcare system is considerable, as it is a frequent presentation in primary care and is one of the most common conditions treated by podiatrists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and orthopaedic surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recently published analysis of 1.6 million patient-encounter records from the Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health primary care dataset revealed that general practitioners (GPs) in Australia encounter an estimated 60,000 cases of hallux valgus every year (an approximate cost of AU$2.2 M in Medicare subsidies for initial GP consultations alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]) while Medicare Benefits Schedule data indicates that approximately 7,000 hallux valgus surgical procedures are performed by orthopaedic surgeons in the private sector per year, at an estimated cost of AU$3 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although substantial, this is an underestimate of the true economic burden of hallux valgus surgery, as many procedures are also performed in public hospitals and by podiatric surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Despite the high prevalence, associated impairments in quality of life and economic burden of hallux valgus, there are no widely adopted, evidence-based clinical guidelines to inform the selection of the most appropriate interventions. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] recommend that people with hallux valgus should first be provided with analgesia, footwear advice, bunion splints or orthoses. If these treatments are not effective or the severity of the condition progresses, surgical referral is then recommended. However, the NICE guidelines caution that these recommendations are based primarily on expert opinion rather than evidence. In Australia, where no such guidelines exist, people with painful hallux valgus presenting to GPs are most commonly provided with advice, pain medications and referral to orthopaedic surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Non-surgical management of hallux valgus may involve footwear advice or modification, foot orthoses, night splints, and physical therapies (manual therapy, taping or foot exercises). In podiatric clinical practice, these interventions are often combined in a multifaceted approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of any of these interventions. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of non-surgical interventions for hallux valgus identified 16 parallel-group and crossover studies evaluating a wide range of non-surgical interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Overall, included trials were of low methodological quality. Many had small sample sizes (12 out of 16 studies having &lt; 60 participants) and short follow-up periods (10 out of 16 having follow-up &lt; 3 months), thus providing low certainty as to the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions and longer-term management of the condition.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Of the available non-surgical treatments, the most widely used are footwear, foot orthoses and foot exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and there is preliminary evidence supporting the use of these approaches. Ill-fitting footwear is an important modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of hallux valgus, as it has been shown that the likelihood of having the condition is significantly greater in those who have worn shoes with a very narrow toe box between the ages of 20 and 29 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, if the condition is already present, the provision of extra-depth footwear which accommodates the broader forefoot may reduce pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Foot orthoses have been shown to reduce load under the great toe and medial midfoot in people with hallux valgus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and a randomised trial reported a significant reduction in pain at six months those who received this intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As hallux valgus progresses, the malalignment of the first metatarsophalangeal joint results in decreased muscle size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and subsequent weakness of the muscles responsible for hallux plantarflexion and abduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, a recent trial of older people (78% women) found that a progressive, resistance exercise program improved hallux plantarflexion strength by approximately 20% over 12 weeks and resulted in an improvement in perceived foot health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">The available evidence provides preliminary support for the use of footwear, foot orthoses and foot exercises for the treatment of hallux valgus, but these three promising approaches are yet to be evaluated in combination. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomised trial comparing multifaceted, non-surgical intervention (footwear, foot orthoses, foot exercises, advice, and self-management) versus advice and self-management alone for reducing pain associated with hallux valgus. The secondary objective is to obtain statistical parameters to inform the main trial sample size calculation and provide a signal of efficacy to justify the future main trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par61">The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomised trial comparing multifaceted, non-surgical intervention (footwear, foot orthoses, foot exercises, advice, and self-management) versus advice and self-management alone for reducing pain associated with hallux valgus. Although our recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] identified two studies reporting significant reductions in pain with the use of foot orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] in people with hallux valgus, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions when used in combination, which is more reflective of contemporary clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par62">A key limitation of the study design is the inability to blind the research staff administering the interventions, however as the outcomes are participant-reported and participants are blinded by limited disclosure, the study can be considered to be assessor-blinded. The most likely barrier to acceptability of (and therefore adherence to) the intervention is aesthetic concerns regarding the footwear. This is a common and largely unavoidable issue with footwear interventions, given their unique role as both a treatment and an item of clothing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Acceptability may be of particular concern in this study, due to the shoes requiring an extra wide toe box to alleviate pressure from the deformity.</p>
              <p id="Par63">The study design has several key strengths, including randomisation, concealed allocation, and blinded analysis, and the reported protocol adheres to the SPIRIT 2013 statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the CONSORT 2010 statement extension to randomised pilot and feasibility trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We have selected intervention components that have demonstrated safety and acceptability, are relatively low cost and accessible in the Australian context, so the package of interventions is likely to be easily implemented and scalable if feasibility is demonstrated and the subsequent fully-powered trial demonstrates clinical efficacy. The study design also incorporates objective measurement of adherence, limited efficacy outcome measures addressing the relevant domains of pain and muscle strength, and plantar pressure assessment to provide insights into the potential mechanisms by which footwear and foot orthoses may alleviate loading on the first metatarsophalangeal joint.</p>

                <title>Trial status</title>
                <p id="Par64">The study commenced recruitment in June 2021 and the first participant completed baseline testing on July 8, 2021. However, due to stay-at-home restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment and data collection were suspended from July 15 to 27 and from August 5 to October 21, 2021 (94 days in total) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The study recommenced on October 22, 2021, and we envisage that 12-week follow ups will be completed by July 30, 2022. The findings will be reported to participants, disseminated via peer-reviewed journal articles and presented at international conferences in 2022/3.</p>
