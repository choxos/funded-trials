                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Australia persistently has one of the highest rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the world. Australia’s National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) sends a biennial Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)—the ‘NBCSP kit’—to everyone eligible for the programme between 50 and 74 years old; however, participation in the programme is low, especially in the 50- to 60-year-old age group. Our previous efficacy trial (‘SMARTscreen’) demonstrated an absolute increase in uptake of 16.5% (95% confidence interval = 2.02–30.9%) for people sent an SMS with motivational and instructional videos, from their general practice prior to receiving their NBCSP kit, compared to those receiving usual care. Building on the strengths of the SMARTscreen trial and addressing limitations, the ‘SMARTERscreen’ trial will test the effect on participation in the NBCSP of sending either an SMS only or an SMS with online video material to general practice patients due to receive their NBCSP compared to ‘usual care’.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">SMARTERscreen is a three-arm stratified cluster randomised controlled trial involving 63 general practices in two states in Australia. Eligible patients are patients who are aged 49–60 years and due to receive their NBCSP kit within the next 2 weeks during the intervention period. General practices will be equally randomised to three trial arms (21:21:21, estimated average 260 patients/practice). The two interventions include (i) an SMS with an encouraging message from their general practice or (ii) the same SMS with weblinks to additional motivational and instructional videos. The control arm will receive ‘usual care’. Using the intention-to-treat approach, primary analysis will estimate the three pair-wise between-arm differences in the proportion of eligible patients who participate in the NBCSP within 6 months of when their kit is sent, utilising screening data from the Australian National Cancer Screening Register (NCSR). Patient intervention adherence to the interventions will also be evaluated. Findings will be incorporated into the Policy1-Bowel microsimulation model to estimate the long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">SMARTERscreen will provide high-level evidence determining whether an SMS or an SMS with web-based material sent to general practice patients prior to receiving their NBCSP kit increases participation in bowel cancer screening.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par19">Australia has one of the highest rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Currently, 40% of CRC cases are diagnosed at stage 3 or 4 leading to a poorer prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Screening for precancerous adenomas and early-stage cancer, at which time they can be easily treated, improves outcomes and is cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Australia has a National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP), which is a coordinated, population-based screening programme that sends immunochemical Faecal Occult Blood Test (FIT) kits to eligible Australians aged 50 to 74 years every 2 years. The kits are free and sent directly to a person’s home where two samples can be self-collected and returned for testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the convenience of this process, uptake of the NBCSP is only 40.9% with fewer people in the younger age groups completing the kit; currently, only 31.6% of people between 50 and 54 years return the kit for testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Modelling has estimated that if screening participation increased by an additional 10%, 24,300 additional CRC diagnoses and 16,800 additional CRC deaths could be prevented, and an additional $300 million dollars in healthcare expenditure saved over the next 25 years in the Australian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par20">Multiple strategies have been tested to increase CRC screening uptake, all having varying degrees of success either as single or multifaceted interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Of these, endorsement from a patient’s general practitioner (GP) has been demonstrated to have one of the biggest impacts on increasing uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Direct engagement by GPs with their patients increases patient awareness about screening and reduces anxiety and fear about participating in screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Australia, the kit is sent directly to the participant from the NBCSP, and currently, there is no coordinated and efficient way for the GP to prompt or encourage their patients to participate in screening.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Short message services (SMS) are being used more often by general practice to communicate with patients because this approach provides an opportunity to reach large numbers of patients in real time and messages can be viewed discreetly multiple times at an individual’s convenience and have demonstrated success at increasing screening uptake internationally[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Between 2020 and 2021, we undertook a trial in 21 general practices, called SMARTscreen to test an intervention which combined, in one SMS, multiple evidence-based components known to increase screening uptake including a message of endorsement from a credible source (i.e. the GP) and weblinks to motivational video narratives and instructions for how to do the test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The SMS was sent to patients from their general practice just before they were due to receive their NBCSP kit. The SMARTscreen trial demonstrated that sending SMS prompts from a patient’s general practice increased NBCSP kit return by 16.5% (95% confidence interval = 2.0–30.9%; 39% kit return in the intervention practice compared with 23% in control practices) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and was acceptable and feasible to both practice staff and patients (in submission). Generalisability of the results was limited because only one regional location in Australia was involved and, as the data were collected at the aggregated practice level, this meant that the analysis by individual patient characteristics was limited. We were also unable to differentiate between the effect of receiving the SMS and the contribution of the materials accessed via weblink within the SMS message (i.e. video content) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par22">Another limitation was that the date the patient’s NBCSP kit was due in the SMARTscreen trial was approximated from either birthdate or previous kit return date data recorded in general practice electronic health record (EHR). Recently, the Australian Government launched a National Cancer Screening Register (NCSR) that enables a coordinated approach to invitations, reminders, and follow-up for bowel and cervical cancer screening. The NCSR allows GPs to directly access their patients’ screening status, including when the next kit is due and their screening history through their electronic medical software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Using the NCSR data will provide a more accurate date for the FIT arrival to inform the timing of SMS interventions.</p>
                <p id="Par23">The SMARTERscreen trial builds on the strengths and addresses the limitations of SMARTscreen. This trial will involve testing the effect of an SMS alone or the SMS in combination with a web-based link with revised video content, compared with usual care in a larger and more diverse general practice population across metropolitan and rural areas. The due date for when the NBCSP kit will be sent, and the outcome of screening participation will be collected directly from the NCSR records instead of relying on general practice electronic health records and therefore will provide more reliable information. Individual patient characteristics will be collected from the NCSR and practices providing more information about the impact of the interventions on screening behaviour by age, sex, previous screening history, and location (based on the geographical location of the patients’ general practice).</p>

              <title>Objectives {7}</title>
              <p id="Par24">SMARTERscreen is a three-arm parallel cluster randomised controlled superiority trial in general practices in the Australian states of Victoria and Queensland. The general practices will be allocated on 1:1:1 ratio to test all three pair-wise comparisons between arms:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par25">Control arm: practices continue with usual care in which general practitioners continue with opportunistic discussions about bowel cancer screening;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">Intervention arm 1: an ‘SMS only’ message sent to the patient from their general practice advising them that their FIT kit will be coming in the mail soon and that their GP strongly advises that they complete it</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">Intervention arm 2: an ‘SMS bundle’ is sent which is the same message as for intervention 1, but with a weblink to extra online information and resources designed to increase participation in the NBCSP.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par28">The trial aims to assess whether sending either an SMS alone or an SMS in combination with a web-based link to additional motivational resources to 49- to 60-year-old general practice patients who are due to receive their kit from the NBCSP will increase CRC screening uptake in the programme within 6 months of when their kit is due compared to the control arm, respectively. Further, the trial aims to assess whether including a web-based link in the SMS to motivational and instructional videos increases screening uptake compared to SMS alone. Patients’ screening status, defined as having a recorded FIT result within 6 months of when their kit is due, will be extracted at the individual level from the NCSR.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Secondary aims will be:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par30">To identify patient characteristics, including age, sex, previous screening, and location of practice, that modify the intervention effect of SMS only and SMS bundle compared to the control on proportion who uptake CRC screening within 6 months</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">To evaluate adherence to the intervention by measuring the number of SMS/SMS bundles unable to be delivered to patients relative to the number sent, the proportion of people who opt out of receiving more SMS/SMS bundles, the proportion of people who receive the SMS bundle who open the SMS weblink and view the videos</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two interventions compared to usual care and potential health cost savings if a SMS intervention were to be adopted and implemented nationally. This objective includes estimating the potential number of lives saved by increasing screening uptake.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Hypotheses</title>
                <p id="Par33">Our primary hypotheses are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par34">A GP practice-endorsed SMS sent from general practice to patients aged between 49 and 60 years old and due for a NBCSP kit will increase the proportion of patients who return the NBCSP kit within 6 months of when their kit is sent compared to usual care;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">A SMS bundle with a GP endorsement of the NBCSP and additional material (i.e. motivational and instructional videos) from general practice to patients aged between 49 and 60 years old and due for a NBCSP kit will increase the proportion of patients who return the NBCSP kit within 6 months of when their kit is sent compared to usual care;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">Proportion of general practice patients who return the NBCSP kit within 6 months of when the kit was due will differ between patients aged between 49 and 60 years old and due for a NBCSP kit who receive SMS bundle with a GP endorsement of the NBCSP and additional material (i.e. motivational and instructional videos) compared to those who receive an SMS with only GP endorsement of the NBCSP.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par37">Secondary hypotheses:</p>
                <p id="Par38">Sending a GP practice-endorsed SMS with/without additional motivational material to people before their kit is sent will be cost-effective compared with usual care.</p>

                  <title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for general practices</title>
                  <p id="Par41">Practices will be included if they are in Queensland or Victoria, use electronic health record (EHR) software compatible with the National Cancer Screening Register (NCSR) (Best Practice, Medical Director Version 4) and are willing to download the free NCSR application which provides a portal between the NCSR and the general practice EHR. Practices will be eligible if they have at least two full-time equivalent (FTE) GPs working in their general practice and have a practice manager (or delegate) who will champion the study throughout the trial period. General practices geographically located in very remote areas, as defined by the Modified Monash Model (MMM) category 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which includes offshore and central Australian locations, will be excluded for logistical reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par42">Practices will not be approached where it is known that they have been involved in recent research projects in cancer screening or are involved in other bowel cancer research projects at the University of Melbourne, or cancer screening quality improvement programmes for example those conducted by the local Primary Health Networks.</p>
                  <p id="Par43">Under the NBCSP ‘hot zone policy’, the NBCSP suspends sending out kits for up to 6 months of the year to certain areas defined by postcode due to extreme heat during summer (correspondence from the NBCSP). Practices will be ineligible if they are in areas classified as ‘hot zones’ as their patients will not receive a kit during some or all the trial intervention period. ‘Hot zones’ account for 111 (25%) of 447 postcodes and 367 (23%) of practices in Queensland (none in Victoria), and therefore practices sampled will still represent most practices in Queensland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. General practices in Australia can operate as independent small businesses or as larger businesses with multiple different clinics. When practices in different physical locations have combined EHRs for patients at all practices, these practices will be treated as one practice in the trial. The “main practice” will be defined as the practice location that the owner or staff identify as being the principal practice. If the practice is in the treatment group, the phone number (and logo) of the main practice will be the one sent in the SMS to all patients.</p>
                  <p id="Par44">When more than one practice shares EHRs but identify as separate practices (i.e. they do not share the same logo and/or name), and whose patient records cannot be separated, they will not be included in the trial. In the unusual case where more than one practice shares EHRs, but if one is in a hot zone and one is not, only the patients living outside of the hot zone will be included in the study.

Patients provide consent for the use of their health information when they join a practice, and this includes data from sites that provide access to the Provider Digital Access (PRODA) portal, an online identity verification and authentication system that lets GPs securely access government online services including the NCSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recently, the NCSR have built a portal (the Health Provider Portal—‘HPP’) so the data transfer between practice and the NCSR can occur in real time, for example during a consultation. Using the HPP, the GP can check if a patient is due for screening. To avoid having to do this for every eligible individual (potentially 100 s of patients per practice), we have developed a way for the practice to do this in bulk using a secure file transfer portal (SFTP). To ensure the secure transfer of data between the practice and the NCSR has been established, we require the practice to have the NCSR HPP installed as part of their involvement in the trial. The transfer details are described below.</p>

The SMS contains a personalised greeting to the patient using their first name only, the general practice name and telephone number, and a GP endorsement of the NBCSP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The SMS will be delivered by GoShare, an online tool developed by Healthily, a company that sends timely educational resources to consumers directly from their general practice via SMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Within the SMS, participants will be provided the opportunity to opt out of receiving any further health promotion SMS from Healthily, but this will not stop them from receiving other SMS messages from their practice (e.g. appointment reminders). The SMS wording is: ‘Hi [insert first name of patient here], Your free bowel cancer screening kit will arrive in the post soon. [insert general practice name here] strongly encourages you to do this test. Call us on [insert general practice phone number here] if you have any questions. Reply STOP to opt out.’ 3.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Intervention 1, the SMS only</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7756_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

The SMS will consist of the same text message as Intervention 1 but with an added weblink to the following motivational and instructional materials: a GP endorsement of the NBCSP, a consumer co-designed video of relatable people talking about why it is important to participate in the NBCSP, an animated instructional video to provide simple step-by-step instructions on how to complete the NBCSP kit, and a link to more information about the NBCSP. The wording is: ‘Hi [insert first name of patient here], Your free bowel cancer screening kit will arrive in the post soon. [insert general practice name here] strongly encourages you to do this test. We also recommend you watch these videos [weblink to videos inserted here]. Call us on [insert general practice phone number here] if you have any questions. Reply STOP to opt out.’ The first part of the weblink shows a similar message from the general practice with the GP logo. The second and third parts include video material co-designed by Cancer Council Queensland, tested with 200 consumers and a group of experts, led by BG and the SMARTERscreen steering group. The motivational video (second part of the bundle) is a montage of three people (real consumers) discussing the benefits of doing the NBCSP kit. The instructional video (third part of the bundle) is an edited version from the NBCSP and demonstrates how to do the test (unpublished). There is also a link to more information about the NBCSP.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Intervention 2, the SMS bundle with the SMS with a weblink (i) and contents (ii–iv)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7756_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                  <p id="Par75">General practices can withdraw from the SMARTERscreen trial at any time without providing a reason, but after the practices are randomised, we will not be able to exclude their patient data as they are collected in a de-identified form and will be included as part of the main analyses even if they receive part or none of the intended intervention. Patients can opt out of receiving any more SMS from Healthily by replying “STOP” to the text message. This will not stop them from receiving messages from their GP, only block future messages from Healthily. Posters will be in the waiting room of all practices to inform patients about the trial and to let them know they can ask not to be included in the trial; this will only be possible prior to de-identified data collection from the practice EHR.</p>
                  <p id="Par76">Patients who are eligible to receive a NBCSP kit at the beginning of the intervention period after randomisation occurred but are subsequently not sent a FIT kit during the trial intervention period (coded as “FIT kit not sent’) will be excluded from the primary analysis. Reasons patients are not sent a kit during the 6-month intervention period may be as follows: (a) they opted out of receiving kits from the NBCSP; (b) they put their NBCSP kits on temporary hold; (c) they have a recently recorded bowel cancer diagnosis; (d) they have recently had a colonoscopy (and are not due screening); or (e) they have a record of having had a recent FIT test elsewhere.</p>

For patients who were sent the NBCSP kit, the outcome variable will be coded as having either a ‘FIT kit returned’ or ‘FIT kit not returned’. ‘FIT kit returned’ will include patients who have a date for the returned NBCSP kit in the NCSR registry within 6 months of when their kit was due. ‘FIT kit not returned’ will include patients who were sent a kit but they either do not have a date recorded, or the date is outside the 6-month range. After randomisation has occurred, patients who were eligible to receive a NBCSP kit at the beginning of the intervention period but were subsequently not sent a FIT kit during the trial intervention period will be coded as ‘FIT kit not sent’. This will include patients who were not sent a kit during the 6-month intervention period for a number of reasons: (a) they opted out of receiving kits from the NBCSP; (b) they put their NBCSP kits on temporary hold; (c) they have a recently recorded bowel cancer diagnosis; (d) they have recently had a colonoscopy (and are not due screening); or (e) they have a record of having had a recent FIT test elsewhere.

Planned primary comparisons are the two intervention arms (SMS only and SMS bundle) with the control arm, respectively, and the SMS only intervention with the SMS bundle. The Holm-Bonferroni correction was used to control the family-wise error rate across three pairwise comparisons. Thus, for the purposes of the sample size calculations, we conservatively set the alpha at 0.017. We assumed that 34% of patients in the control arm will have completed their FIT, based on the National screening data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Sixty-three practices with an average of 260 of eligible patients per practice (standard deviation = 197; range 51 to 753; coefficient of variation = 0.76) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] will be sufficient to detect a difference of 10% absolute increase in participation in the NBCSP within 6 months from when the NBCSP kit is due between each intervention arm (SMS only and SMS bundle) and control arm (44% vs 34%), respectively; and to detect a smaller difference of 7.5% (44% vs 51.5%) between the SMS only and SMS bundle intervention arms. The total of 63 practices allows for an additional practice per arm for potential loss of practices due to closures or merges. A national 10% increase in screening participation would prevent 27,000 bowel cancers and 16,800 deaths and is associated with an additional $200 million in costs over current screening levels over the next 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We anticipate that adding the weblinks to motivational and instructional videos in the SMS would have a smaller additional effect on increasing screening participation compared to a SMS only.</p>

The project officers will ensure all staff know about the trial before it starts and set up a process for staff to contact them if they have questions or to let them know if there are any staff changes during the trial.

The NCSR will send the dataset back to the general practice and a second dataset with all identifying data removed will be securely provided to the research team for analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Depending on the NCSR capacity, to reduce the workload for the general practice and minimise risk for data errors, the de-identified dataset for analysis may be generated by NCSR and securely provided to the investigators for analysis.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Data collection, dataset names, and timepoints (EHR, electronic health record; GP, general practice; NCSR, National Cancer Screening Register; GoShare, the SMS provider) (Proposed timeline, subject to change.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7756_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>

Both regression models will use generalised estimating equations with robust standard errors to allow for clustering by general practice and will adjust for geographical remoteness (metropolitan/larger regional and rural/smaller regional) and state (Queensland and Victoria).

In brief, the model simulates the life histories of bowel lesion(s) (conventional adenoma and sessile serrated lesion) and cancer development, bowel cancer survival, and bowel cancer screening in individuals in Australian population. Each simulated individual could develop up to ten adenomas and ten serrated lesions simultaneously. The simulated individuals who have advanced adenoma(s) (i.e. a conventional adenoma that is large, with high-grade dysplasia, or with villous histology) and/or sessile serrated lesion(s) have an annual risk of developing into a preclinical cancer. Over time, a preclinical cancer can progress to a more advanced stage or become clinically diagnosed due to symptoms or bowel cancer screening. Patients diagnosed with bowel cancer have a risk of dying, which varies by cancer stage at diagnosis and time since cancer diagnosis. In the model, patients who survive for 5 years after cancer diagnosis are assumed to no longer be affected by bowel cancer and have no additional risk of dying from bowel cancer compared with the average population with no bowel cancer.</p>
                  <p id="Par135">For this economic evaluation, the NBCSP participation rates for each intervention arm in the trial and the costs associated with sending a GP practice-endorsed SMS with/without additional motivational material will be incorporated into the Policy1-Bowel model. Cost-effectiveness and the difference in the 5-, 10- and 20-year bowel cancer incidence and mortality outcomes among participants of the two SMS intervention arms versus the control arm will be estimated. Furthermore, the model will also be used to estimate the budget impact on the health care cost and the 5-, 10-, and 20-year cancer incidence and mortality reduction in the Australian population if the SMS intervention was adopted and implemented nationwide compared with the current practice.</p>

              <p id="Par143">This protocol describes the trial design informed by the SMARTscreen trial which demonstrated that using an SMS with a combination of additional features including endorsement by a primary care clinician, a motivational video, instructions for how to do the NBCSP kit, and links to extra information was efficacious for increasing bowel cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This trial—‘SMARTERscreen’—will address the limitations we found in SMARTscreen which included a potential lack of generalisability as we only included regional practices from one state in Australia, the use of incomplete data as the data used to calculate the results were from general practice electronic health records, and we only had aggregated data at the practice level.</p>
              <p id="Par144">Increasing participation in the Australian NBCSP has the potential to reduce bowel cancer incidence and reduce associated health costs over 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and bring the Australian screening programme in line with international bowel cancer screening programmes which have much higher participation rates of 60–70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This is one of the health priorities of the Australian Government.</p>
