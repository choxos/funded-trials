              <abstract>
                <p>The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a suite of implementation strategies of varying intensities on centre-based childcare service implementation of nutrition guideline recommendations at 12-month follow-up. A six-month three-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial was undertaken with 69 services, randomised to one of three arms: high-intensity strategies (executive support; group face-to-face training; provision of resources; multiple rounds of audit and feedback; ongoing face-to-face and phone support); low-intensity strategies (group face-to-face training; provision of resources; single round of audit and feedback); or usual care control. Across all study arms, only three high-intensity services were compliant with overall nutrition guidelines. A significant group interaction was found between the three arms for compliance with individual food groups. Relative to control, a significantly greater proportion of low-intensity services were compliant with dairy, and a significantly greater proportion of high-intensity services were compliant with fruit, vegetables, dairy, breads and cereals, and discretionary foods. No significant differences between the high- and low-intensity for individual food group compliance were found. High-intensity implementation strategies may be effective in supporting childcare service implementation of individual food group recommendations. Further research is warranted to identify strategies effective in increasing overall nutrition compliance.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease study reported that more than 11 million deaths and 255 million disability-adjusted life years worldwide were due to dietary risk factors alone, including low fruit and wholegrain food intake, and high sodium intake [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Evidence shows that dietary patterns and food preferences established in childhood track into adulthood, increasing the risk of future chronic disease [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As such, the World Health Organization encourages countries to develop national nutrition policies and dietary guidelines with recommendations for healthy eating behaviours in childhood, as a disease prevention strategy at a population level [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Early childhood education and care services (hereby referred to as childcare services) provide access to a large number of children aged 0–6 years, at a critical stage of dietary habit development [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Australia, 767,400 children aged 0–5 years attend some type of formal childcare [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] where they can consume up to 67% of their recommended daily dietary intake [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Evidence suggests that children’s dietary intake can be improved by interventions targeting the nutrition environments of childcare services [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Childcare services are subject to menu dietary guidelines [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] regarding the quantities and types of food and drinks provided to children and, thus, provide an opportunistic setting for public health nutrition interventions to improve guideline implementation.</p>
              <p>Despite the existence of setting-specific dietary guidelines, previous national and international research has identified that such recommendations are poorly implemented. For example, a 2017 study assessing 57 childcare service menus in New Zealand reported only 5% of menus met criteria relating to quality, variety and quality of foods [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Australia, a 2017 audit of 70 menus from childcare services across New South Wales (NSW) determined that none of the menus were compliant with nutrition guidelines [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, none of the menus provided adequate servings of vegetables or meat/meat alternatives, and 76% provided discretionary foods (i.e., foods high in kilojoules, saturated fat, added sugars and added salt) [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>Childcare service staff report substantial barriers to achieving compliance with recommendations, most commonly around skills, knowledge, resources and managerial support [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Such challenges to implementation need to be addressed in order for dietary recommendations to produce improvements in child nutritional intake. Despite this, a 2020 Cochrane systematic review [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] identified only two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting findings of interventions to improve the implementation of dietary guidelines regarding food and drink provision to children by childcare services [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. One further RCT has been identified reporting the effect of a childcare-based intervention on menu compliance with dietary guidelines [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The first, a US intervention which included nutrition curriculum; professional development for staff; food service recommendations; and family, healthcare provider, and community grocery store engagement, reported no significant improvements in food provision at two year follow-up [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. </p>
              <p>One of the remaining RCTs is an Australian trial by Finch and colleagues, which tested the effects of a low-intensity implementation strategy, including the provision of staff training and resources and a single round of audit and feedback, and found no improvements in overall menu or individual food group compliance among the intervention arm compared to control at six-month follow-up [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The final trial by Seward and colleagues, also undertaken in Australia, tested the effects of a higher-intensity implementation strategy, designed to overcome barriers to the implementation of nutrition guidelines [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The intervention included the provision of staff training and resources, multiple rounds of audit and feedback, securing executive support, and ongoing face-to-face and telephone support. While there were no differences between intervention and control groups in overall menu compliance with guidelines, the study reported significant improvements in the intervention arm for compliance with five out of six individual food groups at six-month follow-up, suggesting that the intervention had improved food provision to some extent. </p>
              <p>To date, short-term (six-month) changes in menu composition have been reported for the two Australian trials [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], however, the sustainability of these effects are unknown. As such, longer periods of follow-up are required to assess whether these effects attenuate over time. Whilst the outcomes from the two trials were reported separately as two-arm RCTs, the trials were conducted concurrently, service randomisation occurred in parallel, and the studies shared a control arm. This provides an opportunity for comparison between the three groups within the trials. Given that the interventions in each trial varied in intensity and strategies, measured the same primary outcomes and had the same follow-up periods, comparison of the interventions as a three-arm RCT would be particularly useful to help inform policy and health practitioner decisions regarding the intensity of implementation support, and hence public health practice and resource allocation. As such, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a suite of implementation strategies of varying intensities (high and low) on childcare service (i) overall; and (ii) individual food group, compliance with nutrition guidelines at 12-month follow-up. The impact of the intervention on the mean number of food groups compliant with guidelines, and the mean servings of individual food groups was also assessed.</p>

                <p>A three-arm RCT was conducted with centre-based childcare services within the Hunter New England Local Health District of NSW, Australia, that prepare and provide all food and drink to children while in care. The Hunter New England Local Health District encompases 368 childcare services, of which 106 are long day care services that prepare and provide food to children onsite. This region is also the location of one of Australia’s only ‘implementation laboratories’ in which the research team are embedded within the local health service [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

                  <title>2.3.1. Intervention Development</title>
                  <p>The six-month implementation strategies for the high- and low-intensity interventions aimed to increase the implementation of recommendations outlined in the Caring for Children resource [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Caring for Children resource outlines the menu dietary guidelines regarding the quantities and types of foods to be provided to children, developed specifically for childcare services within NSW, Australia. Both the high- and low-intensity interventions were delivered to all staff within participating childcare services given the supporting roles educators and other staff play in the planning of menus [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In particular, the interventions targeted service managers, given their operational leadership role, and cooks, given their primary role in menu planning and food preparation within these services. Both interventions were developed by an experienced team of implementation scientists, behavioural scientists, health promotion practitioners, and dietitians, in consultation with childcare service cooks and service managers [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The interventions were designed to address the identified barriers and enablers to the implementation of the menu dietary guidelines based on the Theoretical Domains Framework [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (TDF) and previous research conducted in the childcare setting [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
                  <p>The TDF is a theoretical framework of determinants considered to influence behaviour, which may enable or impede the implementation of evidence-based practice [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The TDF incorporates 33 theoretical models and frameworks of behaviour change, and has been empirically validated in the childcare setting, as well as healthcare settings [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The TDF was applied in this study to provide a systematic and theoretical guide in which to both assess the barriers and enablers to implementing nutrition guidelines in the setting, and to identify the potential behavioural change factors to be targeted in order to improve guideline implementation. As part of the intervention strategy development, a semi-structured interview based on the TDF was conducted with staff of seven childcare services, to identify relevant settings-based barriers and enablers to implementation of menu dietary guidelines. Such an approach was chosen as qualitative research can provide additional information to assist in understanding processes, context and complexity, that quantitative approaches alone may not [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Selection and design of both the high- and low-intensity implementation interventions was informed by the findings of these semi-structured interviews, systematic review evidence [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and onsite observations of menu-planning practices. This resulted in identification of a number of determinants of guideline implementation, namely limited knowledge of servings required, limited skills in planning compliant menus and the ability to self-assess compliance, limited experience planning for implementation, limited managerial support, and limited resources [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The content and strategies of each intervention were adapted for different intervention intensities. While both interventions were designed to improve service menu compliance with dietary guidelines, the selection of implementation strategies identified in the low-intensity intervention sought also to consider the costs and pragmatics of implementation from the health service perspective. Considerations resulted in the targeting of a smaller range of barriers, and using less resource-intensive implementation strategies. Further details regarding the process for selection of implementation strategies are reported elsewhere [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

Specifically, it is recommended that service menus provide the following servings per child every day within a two-week period, at a minimum: (i) vegetables and legumes/beans (two servings); (ii) fruit (one serving); (iii) wholegrain cereal foods and breads (two servings); (iv) lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, seeds and legumes (three-quarter servings); and (v) milk, yoghurt, cheese and alternatives (one serving) [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Compliance with nutrition guidelines was determined based on the calculations of servings of each food group provided per child each day. The calculated servings of each food group were rounded to the nearest 0.25 of a serving based on dietitian consensus of a meaningful portion of a serving at a population level. Rounding did not change the overall nutrition guidelines or food group compliance outcomes.</p>

              <p>This study is the first three-arm RCT to compare the effectiveness of high- and low-intensity implementation strategies in improving childcare service compliance with nutrition guidelines for the sector. The study found that neither intervention resulted in a measureable difference in overall nutrition guideline compliance. However, the study also found significant differences in compliance with nutrition guidelines between groups for five out of six individual food groups. These findings provide guidance to policy and practice decision makers responsible for the implementation and sustainability of obesity prevention initiatives in the childcare setting.</p>
              <p>At 12-month follow-up the study found only three services in the high-intensity intervention to be compliant with overall nutrition guidelines, and none in the low-intensity and control arms. These findings are similar to those reported at the six-month follow-up [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and findings from controlled trials included in a Cochrane systematic review [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], suggesting that the delivery of highly intensive support to childcare services produces compliance in only a small proportion (16%) of services. As such, it is likely that for the majority of services, additional and/or alternate implementation strategies and support are required for a longer duration, in order to increase overall compliance among a greater number of services. </p>
              <p>The difficulty in achieving full compliance with guidelines, even with intensive implementation support also suggests that the nutrition guidelines for the sector may be overly complex, and represent an unrealistic goal for services to achieve [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], particularly when there are no requirements for service cooks to have nutrition qualifications. Given such challenges, review of the feasibility and fit of current sector nutrition guidelines with childcare service accreditation requirements is warranted. Statistically significant improvements in the mean number of foods groups compliant with guidelines were found for both the high- and low-intensity interventions, relative to control. As such, improvements to the food provided to children in care may be more likely to be achieved and sustained when modest goals to improve compliance are set [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], rather than an emphasis on overall compliance with nutritional guidelines. In line with this, an incremental approach to implementation may reduce demoralization on the part of childcare services unable to achieve full compliance despite significant investment and effort. Alternatively, it is possible that the selection of implementation strategies do not adequately target the complex calculations required to plan a menu that have been previously reported as significant barriers by childcare staff [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B54-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Online approaches that allow services to self-assess and provide suggestions to modify menus, such as those currently being tested by the research team [<xref rid="B55-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], could provide an alternate strategy to address such challenges in achieving full compliance.</p>
              <p>This study found significant differences between arms in terms of compliance with nutrition guidelines for, and servings of, individual food groups. Specifically, a significant difference in the proportion of the low-intensity and the high-intensity intervention services compliant with recommendations for dairy, compared to control, was observed. While there were only slight increases in compliance and mean servings in the low-intensity group for this food group, a decrease in food group compliance and mean servings was observed in the control group. The mean servings of dairy provided per child, per day were above the recommendations (one serving). This suggests a lack of consistency in the amounts provided across each day of the menu, and it is likely that services were compliant on some, but not all days of the two-week menu (as required for compliance). Significant differences in servings of fruit and discretionary foods were also observed between the low-intensity intervention and control. The high-intensity intervention significantly increased compliance among five of the six food groups (vegetables; fruit; breads and cereals; dairy; and discretionary foods), compared to control; with significant differences in servings for four of these food groups (vegetables; fruit; dairy; and discretionary) also observed. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in food group compliance observed between the low-intensity and the high-intensity intervention, with a significant difference observed only for the servings of vegetables in the high-intensity intervention. Neither intervention produced a statistically significant improvement in compliance or servings for the meat/meat alternatives food group. This finding may suggest there are additional barriers to implementation for this particular food group, which could include costs, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian and vegan diets) or allergies (e.g., eggs) that limit menu options. Collectively, the variable impact of the high- and low-intensity interventions on individual food groups suggests that alternate and tailored strategies for each food group may be needed. Future research should investigate this hypothesis. </p>
              <p>These findings indicate that while some improvements in individual food group compliance can be achieved by low-intensity support, high intensity-interventions are required to produce substantial improvements in a greater number of food groups. Such findings are similar to menu interventions of varying intensity conducted in the school canteen setting, which found the greater the intensity of the implementation strategy, the greater the effect size on canteen menu compliance with policies [<xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Furthermore, the finding that four out of six individual food groups significantly improved in both compliance and servings in the high-intensity arm, compared to control, is in line with a previous review which suggests an upper limit of 80% implementation of public health programs is common [<xref rid="B60-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. </p>
              <p>When comparing the current results to those reported immediately post-intervention (six- month follow-up) within the high-intensity intervention [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a significant improvement remained stable for the fruit, dairy and discretionary food groups at the 12-month follow-up compared to control, indicating that the outcomes achieved directly after the end of the intervention were able to be sustained by childcare services in the absence of any further implementation support. In addition to this, the proportion of services compliant with the vegetables and breads and cereals food groups increased, also becoming statistically significant at 12-month follow-up. The intervention effect for the meat/meat alternatives food group, however, was no longer significant at 12-month follow-up. For the six-month outcomes of low-intensity intervention [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], improvements in compliance for the dairy food group became statistically significant at 12-month follow-up, compared to control. Food group compliance in the control group decreased from six to 12 months for fruit, breads and cereals, meat/meat alternatives and dairy. This suggests the significant findings for some of the food groups are the result of both the control arm reducing compliance and the intervention arms increasing. In light of this, the interventions may be viewed as preventative of a decline in compliance, further warranting the need for sustained support for childcare services to implement the nutrition guidelines. </p>
              <p>Findings from non-controlled and non-randomised trials within the childcare setting report similar findings, more broadly. That is, there is inconsistent evidence of the effectiveness of implementation strategies in improving the implementation of nutrition policies, practices and programs in childcare services [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Given such findings, the collection and reporting of contextual information, for example intervention acceptability, delivery and costs, is recommended to allow for a deeper interpretation of outcomes [<xref rid="B62-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. While intervention acceptability and delivery of the implementation strategies at six months were reported as high for both the low- and high-intensity interventions [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], additional contextual measures at 12-month follow-up, such as acceptability of the intervention dose and timeframe of support, and long-term sustainability of the intervention from the perspectives of service managers and cooks, may have provided further insights into the current findings. Contamination was also examined and reported immediately post-intervention at six months follow-up [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While no services reported receiving any additional intervention or support beyond the prescribed intervention at that time, internal records continually maintained by the research team identified one control service received one round of written feedback on their menu between six to 12 months, which may have had an impact on study findings. Given the investment in designing interventions that directly address identified barriers and enablers to the implementation of menu dietary guidelines according to the TDF, future research examining barriers and enablers as potential mediators of both short-term and long-term changes in menu and food group compliance outcomes is also suggested. This would enable an assessment of the mechanisms of change in which the selected implementation strategies exert their effort, and whether these mechanisms are constant or changing over time [<xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Furthermore, as the low-intensity intervention was designed with consideration given to limited health service resources, assessment of the overall cost to deliver the interventions, and the cost-effectiveness of each intervention compared to control and to each other, would provide valuable information to guide dissemination of such implementation strategies, and in the design of future implementation interventions. Future research into the costs associated with each intervention is, therefore, warranted. </p>
              <p>The study findings should be interpreted in light of the following strengths and limitations. Strengths include a methodologically sound design, namely an RCT, the blinding of outcome data collectors, and the application of theory for development of the interventions. The strategic use of a three-arm RCT design, resulting from using a common control group for two interventions, allowed for study findings to be generated more rapidly as multiple interventions were tested, rather than sequential testing of each individual intervention [<xref rid="B64-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and for the optimising of resources associated with conducting RCTs [<xref rid="B65-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. As resource constraints are not an uncommon barrier to the conduct of large-scale, methodologically rigorous implementation research, employment of multi-arm RCTs in future research would be beneficial. Limitations of the study include a relatively low sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect any differences between the high- and low-intensity interventions. Future research should ensure multi-arm RCTs are fully powered in order to reap the benefits of conducting research using this design. While the methods for assessing menu compliance have previously been employed [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the reliability and validity of this method has not been determined. Furthermore, the research was undertaken in a single region of NSW in which childcare services have been exposed to obesity prevention initiatives for over 10 years [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijerph-17-04664" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As such, the sample may not be representative, and the effects of the interventions may not be generalizable to childcare services nationally. It may be hypothesized that services outside of the region may have had lower menu and food group compliance at baseline, therefore enabling the interventions to produce greater effect sizes. Finally, the secondary outcomes and the comparison of outcomes between the high- and low-intensity interventions were not prospectively registered.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study is the first three-arm RCT to measure the effectiveness of high- and low-intensity implementation interventions in improving childcare service compliance with nutrition guidelines for the sector. Findings suggest that the interventions did not result in improvements in overall menu compliance with nutrition guidelines. Furthermore, marginal differences in food group compliance and food group servings were found when comparing a low-intensity intervention to control, and a high-intensity intervention to low-intensity. However, findings also suggest a high-intensity implementation intervention may be effective in supporting childcare service implementation of individual food group recommendations, compared to control. Such findings provide important information for policy and practice decision makers responsible for the implementation and sustainability of obesity prevention initiatives in the childcare setting. Future research is warranted to identify strategies effective in increasing overall nutrition compliance with nutrition guidelines, and determine the cost-effectiveness of implementation strategies.</p>
