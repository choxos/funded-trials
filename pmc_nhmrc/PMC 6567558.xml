                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Beginning in 2017 we have conducted a 3-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the effectiveness of an early obesity intervention in the first two years of life using either telephone or Short Message Service (SMS) support for mothers. The trial recruited 1155 mothers from their third trimester of pregnancy. This protocol is for a new trial to build on the existing trial using the mother-child dyads retained at 24 months for recruitment to the new RCT. The aim of this new trial is to test whether use of a combination of telephone and SMS interventions is effective in promoting healthy eating and physical activity, as well as reducing child body mass index (BMI) at 3 years of age.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will conduct a parallel RCT with an estimated sample of 750 mother-child dyads retained from the existing trial at 24 months. Mothers who completed the 24 months survey, including a telephone survey and measurement of child’s height and weight will be invited to participate in the new trial. Informed consent will be obtained at the 24 months survey. The participating mother-child dyads will then be randomly allocated to the intervention (combined telephone and text messaging intervention) or the control group. The intervention will comprise three staged telephone consultations and text messages after each of the three intervention booklets is mailed to mothers at specific time-points between two and three years of child age. The main trial outcome measures include a) BMI and BMI z-score measured at 36 months, b) diet, physical activity and screen time c) cost-effectiveness, and d) feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This unique opportunity to link two studies will expedite project start up time, utilise existing research infrastructure and systems to run the study, and optimise the use of an already engaged population of study participants. It can address a significant knowledge gap regarding early obesity prevention for children aged 2 to 3 years. The feasibility and effectiveness of the combined telephone and SMS intervention will indicate whether this is a scaleable, broad-reach and low-cost early obesity intervention.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Ending Childhood Obesity is now a global health policy issue for the World Health Organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Worldwide, the prevalence of childhood obesity increased around eight-fold in both girls (0.7 to 5.6%) and boys (0.9 to 7.8%) between 1975 and 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with 41 million children under the age of 5 affected by overweight or obesity in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. About one in five Australian children aged 2–3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and one third of children aged 2–5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] are affected by overweight or obesity. Promoting healthy feeding and physical activity, together with reducing screen time, are fundamental to preventing obesity among children in the first few years of life and consistent with WHO guidelines on childhood obesity prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Although it is increasingly argued that childhood obesity prevention should begin in the early years, current evidence of effective, cost-effective and sustainable interventions is scarce. Not surprisingly, no quality evidence is found specifically targeting 2–3 year old children. Of the few intervention studies we found for children less than 5 years, most targeted children either from birth to 2 years (with an increasing focus on the first 1000 days of life) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or from 3 to 5 years of age using childcare-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The most frequent intervention duration was 6 months, with outcomes focussed on dietary and physical activity behaviours rather than weight status. Very few studies used short message service (SMS) or telephone support as the main form of early intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Australia most state health departments focus their early obesity prevention program through formal childcare services. For example, the ‘Munch &amp; Move’ program in the state of New South Wales (NSW) aims to promote and encourage healthy eating and physical activity habits and reduce small screen recreation in young children from birth to 5 years who attend early childhood education and care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that about 48% of 2-year-old children and 44% of 3-year-old children did not attend formal childcare services in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, interventions that focus solely on childcare services may miss a large proportion of children in the target age group.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The Healthy Beginnings© program is an early obesity prevention program delivered by Child and Family Health Nurses originally through home visits in the first two years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Healthy Beginnings© was found to be effective in reducing child body mass index (BMI) at 2 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but may not be sustained in the longer term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] nor cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is emerging evidence that interventions delivered through telephone-based counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or SMS improve health behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since 2017, we have conducted a 3-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of using SMS or telephone support, plus mailed educational materials for mothers with newborns, as an alternative delivery model for the Healthy Beginnings© early intervention program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthybeginnings.net.au/">http://www.healthybeginnings.net.au/</ext-link>). The study protocol titled “A 3-arm randomised controlled trial of Communicating Healthy Beginnings Advice by Telephone (CHAT) to mothers with infants to prevent childhood obesity” was published in early 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Known as the CHAT trial, the interventions are being delivered from the third trimester to 2 years of age. The interventions include nine staged mail-outs over 24 months addressing key developmental milestones, followed by either nine staged telephone-support sessions by a Child and Family Health Nurse (six between the 3rd trimester to 12 months and three from 12 to 24 months), or nine sets of SMS messages. Each SMS set comprises eight messages which are sent out twice a week over a 4-week period. However, as stated in the published study protocol on the study design, further funding would be required to assess the outcomes at 24 months.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Based on the preliminary findings from the CHAT trial several advantages of using telephone support as a stand-alone program have been identified. Telephone support was seen by the mothers as more personal and increased the mother’s self-reported likelihood of identifying and addressing challenges with practising the desired health behaviours that influence healthy weight gain (detailed findings to be reported elsewhere). However, these advantages can be reduced by the time and effort spent contacting the participants. On average, the intervention nurse has needed to make 6–10 call attempts to each participant for one successful telephone support session, which is not an efficient use of resources (nurse time). On the other hand, using SMS has advantages as an efficient, simple and lower-cost method to deliver information to mothers and to respond quickly to their queries. Participants can also review responses at a time of their convenience. This is particularly useful for mothers with strong demands on their time. Despite the fact that the text messages were bi-directional, there was limited capacity for the intervention nurses to gather a detailed understanding of the challenges being experienced by mothers through SMS, and responses to mothers were likely to be brief. Thus, the combined intervention (Tel + SMS) being investigated in this new study seeks to mirror a real-life situation where interventions such as telephone support rarely occur in isolation and are often accompanied by SMS reminders and missed call messages. By combining telephone and SMS into an intervention delivery, we will be able to compensate for inherent limitations of each element and greatly improve their collective effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Therefore, in this study protocol we are undertaking a new RCT which will be linked with the existing 3-arm RCT using the same study participants (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This approach will enable us to use the 24-month survey for dual purposes in the existing 3-arm CHAT RCT (Study 1) and the new RCT (Study 2). For Study 1, the 24-month survey will measure the intervention outcome and effectiveness of either the telephone support intervention or the SMS intervention. For Study 2, the 24-month survey will be an integral part of the recruitment process and baseline data collection for this new RCT in determining the effectiveness of a combined telephone and SMS intervention.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study Designs of Study 1 and 2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2019_7058_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Participants and recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par24">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 5 weeks before the participating child turns 2 years old in the existing CHAT trial, their mother or primary caregiver will be sent a letter of invitation with information about the 24-month survey and Study 2. A week later, a text message will be sent out to remind participants of the 24-month survey. Three weeks before the child reaches 2 years, a market survey interviewer will contact participants on behalf of the project team to conduct the 24-month telephone survey. A telephone script will be used to ensure consistency and documentation across all interviewers. Participants will be asked to verbally consent to participation prior to commencing the survey. Once verbal consent is obtained, the interviewer will conduct the 24-month survey (i.e. baseline for Study 2) using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Recruitment flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2019_7058_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par25">During the last section of the telephone survey, interviewers will invite participants to receive a home visit by a research assistant (RA) for face-to-face measurement of their own and their child’s height and weight. Verbal consent will be initially requested by the interviewer, however, once the RA has organised the home visit, they will ask for the participant’s written consent before conducting the measurements. Overall, participants will be offered the following options for participation:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par26">Only consent to complete the 24-month telephone survey</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">Consent to participate in the 24-month telephone survey and the home visit for the anthropometric measurements</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">Consent to participate in options 1 and 2, and also the new RCT to receive the intervention at 2 to 3 years of age; or</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">No consent to participate in any component.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par30">When the RA and the participating mother meet face-to-face to measure her and her child’s height and weight, the RA will first revisit the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form and answer any questions that the participant may have. The RA will then obtain the participant’s written consent for the new trial to support the verbal consent already obtained.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par33">For the existing Study 1 the sample size required was previously presented in the published research protocol (1056 mothers: 352 in each of the 3 arms of the study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A total of 1155 mothers were recruited into the trial exceeding the required sample size by 100 mothers. We originally estimated that a total sample size of 792 (264 per arm × 3) was needed at 2 years to have sufficient power to detect a difference in child BMI of 0.38 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par34">For Study 2, we will need a total sample size of 506 (253 per arm × 2) by the end of the study (at 3 years of age). This would allow us to detect a difference of 0.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in mean BMI (SD = 1.60 based on Healthy Beginnings Trial) at the 2-sided 5% significance level with 80% power. This effect size is achievable based on the findings from a 6-month intervention study in the US that detected a decrease in BMI of 0.40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with children aged 2–5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Allowing for a conservative 15% loss to follow-up between 2 and 3 years, we will need around 600 participants at 2 years of age. This sample size will also give enough power to detect differences in other main outcomes (e.g., a difference of 0.3 in the mean number of daily serves of fruit or vegetables).</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par35">After completing the 24-month (baseline) survey and measurement, participating mothers will be randomly allocated to either the intervention (Tel + SMS) or the control group (Control 2). Randomisation will take place using a web-based tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">http://www.randomization.com/</ext-link>). The intervention allocation scheme will be generated using random permuted blocks stratified by the group allocation in Study 1 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The use of stratified randomisation is to ensure that any carry-over effect of the CHAT intervention of Study 1 will be equally distributed between treatment groups in Study 2.</p>

              <sec id="Sec11">
                <title>Intervention (Tel + SMS) protocol</title>
                <p id="Par36">The intervention will be guided by the Health Belief Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and uses motivational interviewing techniques to facilitate behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The intervention aims to improve mothers’ parenting behaviours and set up healthy behaviours (i.e., healthy feeding practices, active play and reduced screen time). Telephone support will consist of protocol-based sessions. A telephone protocol and manual will be developed to ensure consistency of intervention delivery based on our current trial. The main content is in keeping with the Australian Dietary Guidelines, early childhood developmental guidelines and the Australian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for the Early Years (Birth to 5 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Telephone sessions will be delivered by a clinician (Child and Family Health Nurse/midwife) trained in telephone support, health behaviour change strategies, and child development. Based on our current trial experience, we anticipate that each telephone session will be ~ 20 min in duration.</p>
                <p id="Par37">The Tel + SMS intervention will be delivered between age 2 and 3 years (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Once random allocation is completed, the intervention group will receive scheduled support across 3 time-points (24–28, 28–32, and 32–36 months). At each time-point, participants will be sent one of the three intervention booklets that provide information on key developmental milestones associated with promoting behaviours for healthy weight gain. The intervention booklets will be developed according to the key messages (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) that support child development during this age of a child’s life. Following a mailed intervention booklet, participants will receive a telephone support call from a research clinician. The clinicians will employ a motivational interviewing approach and aim to set goals, build skills and knowledge, address barriers, and manage any anxiety or stress which may act as a barrier to health behaviour change.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Main focus and contents of the staged early intervention and sample of the text messages</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Component/focus</th><th>Main contents</th><th>Sample of SMS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Repeated exposure to healthy foods, limiting exposure to non-core foods</td><td>Recommended dietary intake of food groups, food label reading, healthy food environments, eating family meals, oral health, managing external influences on dietary intake</td><td>“Messy eating and playing with food are normal parts of [baby’s name] development when learning to eat independently.

                <p id="Par38">In addition, participants will also receive two text messages per week for the next 8 weeks (i.e., 16 SMS messages to enhance and reinforce the support provided in the intervention booklet and telephone session). The text messages will be generated and sent using a dedicated, secured web-based software that was used in the existing trial (Study 1). This software has the ability to automate, schedule and personalise the text messages delivered (based on the child’s age) to deliver age appropriate information and to address the message using the child’s and mother’s name. Information can be further tailored at any point during the intervention. Further, a key feature of the SMS program is that the messages are bi-directional so mothers are able to respond to text messages sent and receive a response from the clinicians delivering the program. In addition to sending SMSs on key developmental milestones, mothers will also be reminded of booking telephone calls with our research clinicians. Incoming SMSs will be reviewed daily (except for weekends and public holidays) by the research clinicians.</p>

The booklets will provide information on other aspects of child development such as toilet training, language development and sibling relationships. This strategy is used to maximise mothers’ engagement in the study and to reduce attrition rates.</p>

Intention-to-treat principles will be adopted to analyse all outcomes. The primary analysis for Study 2 will be adjusted for the stratification by Study 1 treatment group, as per CONSORT guidelines. For continuous variables, such as BMI, or BMI z-score, means will be compared using linear regression. For binary categorical variables, logistic regression model will be used. Secondary analyses will additionally adjust for exact age, and also will use mixed model and multiple imputation to assess the effect of loss to follow-up as used in the previous Healthy Beginnings Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Mean differences of BMI or BMI z-score between the intervention and control groups and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) will be reported.</p>

Study 1 intervention will be included in the multivariable regression models to adjust for its effect. In our previous study we demonstrated that, without further intervention, the early intervention effects diminish over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], so any carry-over effect from Study 1 to Study 2 should be small. Even if there is a carry-over effect, it will be balanced between the intervention and control groups by the stratified randomisation.</p>

These will only include the costs of all resources needed to reproduce the intervention. The cost of all intervention materials will be based on market prices.

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated in terms of the incremental cost: a) per unit BMI reduction per child at 3 years, and 2) per QALY gained. Uncertainty in mean costs, outcomes and ICERs will be determined through bootstrapping. Scatter plots of the joint distribution of incremental costs and effects will be displayed on a cost-effectiveness plane and the probability of the intervention being cost-effectiveness will be determined for different willingness-to-pay thresholds.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par57">To our knowledge, the two linked RCTs will be the first to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a telephone-delivered, SMS-delivered, or combined (Tel + SMS) program in preventing early onset of childhood obesity. This new trial will greatly add value to the existing CHAT trial and yield two-fold benefit relevant to filling knowledge gaps in early obesity prevention for children aged 0–3 years: 1) enabling the testing of Study 1 hypothesis at 2 years, and 2) a quick access to recruitment from a pool of eligible cooperative study participants for the new RCT (Study 2). It can fill in a significant knowledge gap in early obesity prevention for children aged 2 to 3 years using a widely accepted and easily administered approach with relatively inexpensive methods.</p>
              <p id="Par58">A new combined telephone support and SMS intervention model has the potential to provide an efficacious early obesity intervention approach with broad-reach at relatively low cost. More importantly, this approach can be adapted and adopted according to community needs, in particular to vulnerable and difficult-to-reach families. The two linked trials will generate new knowledge for policy and practice on the appropriateness, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the early obesity intervention strategies in Australia and in other international settings. It will provide new knowledge on recruitment, retention and acceptability of early obesity prevention interventions in community settings, and will also provide evidence that can be applied for promoting other positive health behaviours. The results will provide a template for how to scale-up the most cost-effective community-based obesity prevention program that can be disseminated under real world conditions. The study has the potential to enable policy makers to make decisions on which community-based programs to invest scarce public health funds. In addition, while there have been some obesity prevention trials in early childhood, none has used a combination of staged and combined telephone and SMS intervention, a novel aspect of this research.</p>
