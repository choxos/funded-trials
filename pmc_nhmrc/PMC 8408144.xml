                <p id="Par1">Inflammation, vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and oxidative stress are believed to play important roles in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis. Human kallistatin (KAL; gene <italic>SERPINA4</italic>) is a serine proteinase inhibitor previously shown to inhibit inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of KAL in AAA through studies in experimental mouse models and patients. Serum KAL concentration was negatively associated with the diagnosis and growth of human AAA. Transgenic overexpression of the human <italic>KAL</italic> gene (<italic>KS-Tg</italic>) or administration of recombinant human KAL (rhKAL) inhibited AAA in the calcium phosphate (CaPO<sub>4</sub>) and subcutaneous angiotensin II (AngII) infusion mouse models. Upregulation of KAL in both models resulted in reduction in the severity of aortic elastin degradation, reduced markers of oxidative stress and less vascular smooth muscle apoptosis within the aorta. Administration of rhKAL to vascular smooth muscle cells incubated in the presence of AngII or in human AAA thrombus-conditioned media reduced apoptosis and downregulated markers of oxidative stress. These effects of KAL were associated with upregulation of Sirtuin 1 activity within the aortas of both <italic>KS-Tg</italic> mice and rodents receiving rhKAL. These results suggest KAL-Sirtuin 1 signalling limits aortic wall remodelling and aneurysm development through reductions in oxidative stress and vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis. Upregulating KAL may be a novel therapeutic strategy for AAA.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important cause of mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Current guidelines recommend surgical repair of large (maximum aortic diameterââ¥â55Â mm in men andââ¥â50Â mm in women) asymptomatic or symptomatic AAAs and imaging surveillance alone for small asymptomatic AAAs (&lt;â55Â mm in men andâ&lt;â50Â mm in women)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The increasing use of abdominal imaging and ultrasound screening programs means that many AAAs are identified when they are small and asymptomatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Luminescence activity was measured within 30Â min, in six separate experiments using the Polar Star Omega (BMG Labtech).</p>

Nominal data were presented as number and percentages and compared by Chi-squared test. Men were divided into quartiles based on serum KAL. The association of serum KAL with AAA diagnosis was assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, CHD, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, stroke, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), serum creatinine, HDL, LDL and aspirin prescription. In men with repeat ultrasound imaging, change in AAA diameter was calculated by averaging the change between successive ultrasound scans and adjusting for the observation time as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Since average weighted yearly change in AAA diameter was associated with the initial AAA diameter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, the association between serum KAL and average AAA growth per year was also expressed as a percentage of the initial AAA diameter. Furthermore, the association of serum KAL quartile with AAA growth greater than median was analysed by logistic regression, adjusting for other risk factors, including initial AAA diameter, diabetes and serum CRP. The relationship between serum KAL and AAA growth was also assessed using linear regression adjusting for the same risk factors.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par48">The main findings of this study were that serum KAL was negatively associated with AAA diagnosis and growth, and that within mouse models upregulating KAL reduced the size of AAAs. The findings suggest that KAL plays a protective role against AAA. A previous proteomic study identified KAL as one of the five proteins found to be differentially up-regulated in AAA patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This previous study included only a small number of hospital recruited patients under investigation for coronary artery disease (17 AAA patients and 17 controls). A more recent study also reported upregulation of KAL in AAA human samples when assessed by Western blotting but reported downregulation of KAL when analysed by real time PCR (36 AAA patients and 12 controls)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Neither study analysed aortic cells. In contrast, in the current study we investigated VSMCs isolated from AAA patients and blood from approximately 1000 men aged over 65Â years recruited from the community and screened for AAA. We found a negative association between serum KAL and AAA diagnosis and growth. The AAAs identified in this cohort were mostly small and therefore the findings are likely representative of the association of KAL with early stage AAA.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Inflammation is thought to play an important role in human AAA pathogenesis and several studies suggest that KAL limits inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Transgenic overexpression of KAL in mice resulted in significant reduction in the plasma levels of a number of cytokines including TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-10 and IL-12 after AAA induction. TNF-Î± is considered a key stimulant of pro-inflammatory responses by promoting cytokine release, oxidative stress and angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. IFN-Î³ is a cytokine that stimulates T cells and macrophages based immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. IFN-Î³ concentrations have been reported to be increased in human AAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. These effects may have been important in the relative AAA resistance of the <italic>KS-Tg</italic> mice but was not found in the mice receiving rhKAL and therefore other mechanisms were examined.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Elastin fragmentation, collagen destruction and VSMC apoptosis are important features of human AAA and have been implicated in AAA development within the CaPO<sub>4</sub> and AngII models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The histopathological assessment in the current study suggested that transgenic overexpression of KAL and administration of rhKAL limited elastin degradation and attenuated fibrosis. These findings are in line with a number of previous studies that suggested that KAL upregulation limits ECM remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Matrix regulating proteins such as MMPs, OPN, OPG and VEGF have been previously implicated in experimental and human AAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In the <italic>KS-Tg</italic> mice, but not mice receiving rhKAL, <italic>Mmp-9</italic>, <italic>Mmp-2</italic> and <italic>Opn</italic> expressions were downregulated. The disparate effects of the two methods of upregulating KAL is likely explained by the less powerful increase in KAL achieved by intermittent i.p. injection as compared to transgenic upregulation. Also the findings were likely contributed to by the different models used. The AngII infused AAA model has greater ECM remodelling and inflammation than the CaPO<sub>4</sub> model which may have overwhelmed the effects of rhKAL.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Apoptosis of VSMCs is known to be important in experimental and human AAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In the current study, KAL upregulation limited DHE and TUNEL staining within the aorta in both AAA models. Furthermore, administration of rhKAL inhibited apoptosis of healthy VSMCs in vitro. Incubation of VSMC with rhKAL also inhibited ROS generation in these cells stimulated by exposure to human AAA-thrombus conditioned media or AngII. Taken together, the findings from the experimental mouse models and in vitro studies suggest that KAL inhibited AAA by blocking inflammation, ROS generation and VSMC apoptosis.</p>
              <p id="Par52">SIRT1 expression in VSMC is required to maintain the structural integrity of the aortic wall in response to oxidant and inflammatory stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and recent studies suggest that VSMC SIRT1 plays a protective role in the AngII-infused AAA model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. SIRT1 has been reported to protect against aortic rupture in response to AngII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. VSMC-specific knockout of <italic>Sirt1</italic> has been reported to accelerate AngII-induced formation and rupture, whereas VSMC-specific overexpression of <italic>Sirt1</italic> suppressed AngII-induced AAA formation and progression in <italic>ApoE</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice. The current study suggests that KAL upregulation increased SIRT1 activity, which likely contributed to the reduced AAA severity in these mice. <italic>SIRT1</italic> expression in tissues obtained from human AAA-body and AAA-neck was similar. However, when a pure population of VSMCs isolated from the tissues were assessed, the <italic>SIRT1</italic> expression was shown to be significantly downregulated in AAA-body VSMCs compared to the VSMCs from the relatively normal region of the AAA-neck.</p>

However, the study was underpowered to examine the relation between fenofibrate and AAA growth. A further ongoing trial (FAME-1) is examining the effect of fenofibrate on the aortic wall. In the current study, fenofibrate upregulated KAL expression in VSMCs in vitro in a dose dependent manner, and a similar effect was observed in AAA-VSMCs, which could provide an approach by which fenofibrate might act to inhibit AAA progression.</p>
              <p id="Par54">The strengths of this study include the assessment of circulating KAL in a large number of men and the further examination of these findings in two rodent AAA models and in vitro studies. Some limitations of this study are acknowledged. First, since KAL has pleotropic functions, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that it limits AAA development by mechanisms not examined in this study. Further studies are needed to substantiate the findings in other populations, including women, and further experimental models. Secondly, systemic rhKAL administration was not effective in limiting inflammation unlike transgenic upregulation. This could be because rhKAL administration may not be as potent as the effect of transgenic overexpression of KAL although this was not specifically confirmed. The most appropriate way to deliver rhKAL to limit AAA needs to be further investigated.</p>
              <p id="Par55">In conclusion, this study suggests a protective role of KAL in AAA pathogenesis through limiting inflammation, ECM remodelling, ROS and VSMC apoptosis. The findings suggest that upregulating KAL maybe a therapeutic target to limit AAA development and progression.</p>
