                <p>Complex medication regimens are highly prevalent, burdensome for residents and staff, and associated with poor health outcomes in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). The SIMPLER study was a non-blinded, matched-pair, cluster randomized controlled trial in eight Australian RACFs that investigated the one-off application of a structured 5-step implicit process to simplify medication regimens. The aim of this study was to explore the processes underpinning study implementation and uptake of the medication simplification intervention. A mixed methods process evaluation with an explanatory design was undertaken in parallel with the main outcome evaluation of the SIMPLER study and was guided by an established 8-domain framework. The qualitative component included a document analysis and semi-structured interviews with 25 stakeholders (residents, family, research nurses, pharmacists, RACF staff, and a general medical practitioner). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and reflexively thematically content analyzed. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative data extracted from key research documents. The SIMPLER recruitment rates at the eight RACFs ranged from 18.9% to 48.6% of eligible residents (38.4% overall). Participation decisions were influenced by altruism, opinions of trusted persons, willingness to change a medication regimen, and third-party hesitation regarding potential resident distress. Intervention delivery was generally consistent with the study protocol. Stakeholders perceived regimen simplification was beneficial and low risk if the simplification recommendations were individualized. Implementation of the simplification recommendations varied between the four intervention RACFs, with simplification implemented at 4-month follow-up for between 25% and 86% of residents for whom simplification was possible. Good working relationships between stakeholders and new remunerated models of medication management were perceived facilitators to wider implementation. In conclusion, the one-off implicit medication simplification intervention was feasible and generally delivered according to the protocol to a representative sample of residents. Despite variable implementation, recommendations to simplify complex regimens were valued by stakeholders, who also supported wider implementation of medication simplification in RACFs.</p>

              <p>Medication regimen complexity is prevalent in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Simplifying medication regimens for residents could lead to benefits such as improved resident wellbeing, more staff time for other care activities, safer medication administration practices and greater resident involvement in medication-related decision making [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Trialing medication simplification activities in RACFs is important due to associations between complex medication regimens and medication administration errors, unplanned hospitalizations and mortality in older people [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>The SImplification of Medications Prescribed to Long-tErm care Residents (SIMPLER) study was a non-blinded, matched-pair, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a single multidisciplinary intervention targeting complex medication regimens [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SIMPLER was the first prospective study to investigate the benefits and harms of medication regimen simplification in RACFs. Medication simplification involves consolidating administration times (e.g., by administering medications at the same time, switching to combination products or long-acting formulations) without changing the therapeutic intent of the medication regimen [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The SIMPLER study protocol and findings have been described previously [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In brief, residents at four RACFs were randomized to receive usual care, while those in four matched RACFs received a medication simplification intervention delivered by an experienced clinical pharmacist using the 5-item Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged CarE (MRS GRACE) [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This implicit, validated tool was designed to guide the process of medication simplification in RACFs. It encourages health professionals to consider resident-related factors, regulatory or safety imperatives, potential for interactions involving medications, and alternative medication formulations that are available when determining whether a medication regimen can be simplified [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It also prompts the health professional to consider potential unintended consequences of simplification such as increased medication costs [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Medication simplification was possible for 65% of residents in the intervention arm. The mean number of medication administration times each day for regular medications was reduced in the intervention group versus the comparison group (−0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.63 to −0.09) at 4-months [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and was sustained at 12-month follow-up [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-18-05778">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>
              <p>Process evaluations, often undertaken to understand why interventions are effective [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and facilitate translation into practice [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], are particularly important for medication interventions in RACFs. Conducting empirical research in RACFs can present numerous challenges [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The medication management cycle in RACFs is complex and involves multiple stakeholders, and culture and processes can differ across RACFs, even those within the same organization. In Australian RACFs, which are similar to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, physicians and pharmacists are usually employed externally to the RACF, and staff administering medications may have good resident knowledge but might not be able to identify all simplification opportunities [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Residents of Australian RACFs are increasingly older and frailer, with complex multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Previous process evaluations of cluster RCTs of healthcare interventions suggest multiple facility, resident, staff, health professional and investigator-related factors can impact on recruitment and intervention delivery in RACFs [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These include organizational leadership, familiarity with research, trust, health literacy, attrition, resource availability and prioritization of other care activities, quality of information provided by study investigators, interprofessional communication, complexity of the intervention and mode of intervention delivery. It is therefore imperative to understand processes underpinning interventions to optimize medication management in RACFs. The aim of this process evaluation was to explore the processes underpinning the implementation and uptake of the medication simplification intervention in the SIMPLER study.</p>

                <p>Research nurses recruited residents in-person where a senior registered nurse (RN) advised the resident was able to self-consent. The research nurses visited residents in their rooms or other private areas to introduce themselves and SIMPLER, and provide an information sheet, and then aimed to return within 7-days to discuss potential participation. On occasion, the research nurse consulted a third party despite the resident being flagged as able to self-consent. Third parties were mailed information and consent forms with a reply-paid envelope and telephoned. Return of the signed consent form via post or email was required for study enrolment. A maximum of three attempts were made to contact third parties; some were contacted more often when the person expressed an interest in potentially providing consent. Some third parties spoke with the resident before providing informed consent or declining to participate.</p>
                <p>Stakeholders reported the recruitment process was time consuming. Multiple recruitment discussions were undertaken by research nurses, with residents and third parties contacted on a median of two occasions (IQR 2–3). Overall, 631 residents met the inclusion criteria and were approached to participate, with 78 of the 239 residents who could self-consent providing informed consent to participate (32.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-05778-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Third-party consent was obtained for 164 of the remaining 392 residents (41.8%). </p>
                <p>Recruitment rates at the 8 RACFs ranged from 18.9% to 48.6% of eligible residents (38.4% overall).

                <title>3.3. Delivery to RACFs and Individual Residents</title>
                <p>The clinical pharmacist was trained on the use of MRS GRACE and intervention delivery by two researchers (JKS, EYH) prior to intervention commencement. The median time from resident recruitment to intervention delivery was 28 days (<xref rid="ijerph-18-05778-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) because the pharmacist waited for a group of residents to be recruited before travelling to each RACF. Three residents died pre-intervention for reasons unrelated to study involvement.</p>
                <p>The clinical pharmacist felt positive about intervention delivery. Medication charts were examined for all participants and care was taken to minimize the time the charts were unavailable to staff. Nursing notes were only referred to when needed to determine an indication for a specific medication.</p>

                  <p>“<italic>There were no issues around it [intervention delivery]. They [the clinical pharmacist] worked around when staff were doing their medication round and yeah it seemed to all go fairly quickly and smoothly, I can remember</italic>.” </p>

                <p>Inspection of the clinical pharmacist’s records, together with the descriptions provided by interviewees, showed intervention delivery was generally consistent with the study protocol despite the pharmacist not referring to MRS GRACE each time. This was because the principles outlined in MRS GRACE had become embedded as part of the pharmacist’s practice, which was consistent with how the tool would likely be used future routine practice. The first step of MRS GRACE is to discuss medication simplification with the resident; however, to maximize efficiency of intervention delivery, the pharmacist determined if simplification was possible (steps 2 to 5 of MRS GRACE) prior to attempting a discussion with a resident for whom simplification was possible. Discussions with residents and/or family members were considered an important component of the intervention but were time consuming to organize and other medication-related issues were sometimes mentioned by residents.</p>

                <p>Resident discussions could not be undertaken when a resident was not present or was unwell. When a resident discussion could not be undertaken, the pharmacist brought this to the attention of the senior RN and GP in the report and had a face-to-face discussion with an RN about the suitability of the simplification recommendation. The pharmacist attempted to call the resident’s GP when simplification was possible and often left messages with GP practice staff. The clinical pharmacist prepared a report with recommendations using a structured template (available on request). Reports were not prepared when simplification was not possible. Intervention delivery was recorded on the medication administration chart regardless of whether simplification was recommended.</p>

The pharmacist debriefed with senior RNs at the end of each day to discuss recommendations, and later discussed the site visit with the embedded researcher (JKS). The pharmacist suggested a follow-up Residential Medication Management Review (RMMR; an Australian Government-funded comprehensive medication review) for four residents but anecdotally reported that multiple residents could benefit from an RMMR.</p>

                <p>Following the pharmacist’s visit, changes to medication administration times required approval and implementation by the RACF manager, senior RN, or GP, while other simplification recommendations (e.g., switching to long-acting/combination products) could only be implemented by the GP. Senior RNs were the main drivers of implementation and utilized strategies such as collating the pharmacist reports and setting aside time to implement recommendations in bulk, integrating the report review into their usual workload when providing care for that specific resident, delegating to the RN perceived to have the best knowledge of that resident, and/or liaising with the GP. Good working relationships between RACF staff and GPs, and an organizational culture that valued medication safety were perceived facilitators for implementation. </p>

                <p>This was also demonstrated at 4-month follow-up, where intervention implementation rates at the four RACFs were 25%, 59%, 62% and 86%. Implementation of recommendations was aided by the aged care provider’s multidisciplinary Medication Advisory Committee (MAC) agreeing on a protocol for implementation of the pharmacist’s recommendations prior to SIMPLER commencement. The RACF with the lowest implementation rate had postponed study commencement to accommodate competing quality improvement commitments, had the lowest recruitment rate and the highest proportion of recommendations that could only be implemented by GPs (i.e., not by senior RNs). The RACF with the highest recruitment rate also had the highest implementation rate. In this RACF, the senior RN championed the project through integrating simplification into their routine work and fostering relationships with local GPs and pharmacists. This RN described a participant with improved quality of life following simplification of analgesia, and later transferred the learnings when providing care for other residents in a similar situation.</p>

                <p>Sometimes RNs were hesitant to implement recommendations to change an administration time without consulting the GP. Effective communication and working relationships aided implementation. It was also felt that implementation was aided by having the pharmacist onsite at the same time as the GP.

                <p>Post-intervention, initial outcomes met expectations for some nurses, although others expected a greater impact.

Participants desired government funding to implement this new service although some suggested that aged care provider organizations could fund the service.

              <p>This process evaluation found that SIMPLER was generally implemented as planned. Despite facility variation, a representative resident sample was recruited. The intervention was delivered consistently; however, implementation of the clinical pharmacist’s recommendations varied considerably between the RACFs and staff relationships with local GPs and community pharmacists were an anecdotal predictor of implementation. Overall, the study was viewed positively, with few negative experiences reported. Stakeholders also identified opportunities to disseminate simplification more widely.</p>
              <p>Clinical trials in RACFs are resource intensive, and effective recruitment strategies are paramount to avoid resource wastage and insufficient sample sizes [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The 38.4% SIMPLER participation rate is similar to several other studies in RACFs [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recruitment rates were slightly higher among residents for whom third party consent was required compared to those who were able to provide consent to participate (41.8% versus 32.6%). Reasons provided for non-participation (e.g., concern about potential undue resident distress or burden, recent illness, lack of time and perceived lack of benefit) were similar to those encountered by others when recruiting people living in RACFs, people with dementia or third parties to participate in trials [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite these factors and other known challenges in recruiting residents with cognitive impairment to participate in trials [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], SIMPLER participants were representative of all residents in terms of age, sex and dementia diagnoses. Study promotional activities helped to raise awareness and face-to-face recruitment discussions were preferred. This is consistent with existing literature that suggests considerable planning and direct methods of communication can aid recruitment [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Lack of familiarity with research in some RACFs, concurrent quality improvement activities, and differing levels of health literacy were perceived to contribute to variation in recruitment. Using pilot-tested and easily understandable materials that incorporate a mix of plain language explanations and visuals, and research nurse training in interactive techniques can aid consumer decision-making about research participation [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the intervention RACFs with the highest recruitment rates also had the highest intervention implementation rates, suggesting RACF organizational culture and appreciation for the study objectives/benefits were also important facilitators. We suggest emphasizing the following during recruitment discussions: the interdisciplinary project nature and shared decision-making; delivery by experienced health professionals; ability to withdraw at any time; that all residents can benefit, including those who are frail or experiencing cognitive impairment; how trial processes can be adapted for residents who are not able to self-report information; and drawing on altruism. Additional strategies mentioned in the literature include mailing study postcards/short flyers to third parties prior to recruitment, offering financial incentives, using concise information sheets, and emphasizing the presence of the trial monitoring committee [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>The intervention was delivered to all but three residents in the intervention arm. No major concerns with the quality of delivery were encountered. Intervention fidelity was supported by utilizing an experienced clinical pharmacist who was trained in the use of a validated simplification tool. The proportion of residents for whom medication simplification was possible was consistent with two previous studies [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Resident or third-party discussions are key to understanding resident preferences [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and explaining the likely impact of simplification on specific medication administration times and formulations prescribed. However, the pharmacist reported difficulty arranging resident/family discussions and the outcomes of subsequent RN/GP discussions with the resident or family are unknown. Future studies should incorporate additional resources and strategies to support best-practice shared decision making in medication management interventions in RACFs [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Evidence from a process evaluation of a cluster RCT of a multifaceted primary care intervention suggests that potentially inappropriate medications may be more likely to be withdrawn when patients are present during a GP’s review of their medication regimen [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>At 4-month follow-up of SIMPLER, at least one of the pharmacist’s simplification recommendations had been implemented in 46 residents (74%), demonstrating the acceptability of the intervention [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, there was considerable variation in responsiveness between facilities and implementation prompts from the research team were required for some RACFs. Similar to a cluster RCT of an intervention to enhance medication use in Belgian RACFs [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], key drivers of implementation included good stakeholder working relationships, presence of a clinical champion, ability to integrate into normal workflows and appreciation for the potential benefits of medication simplification. Although few negative responses or unintended consequences were reported, the perceived impact of the intervention for residents and staff varied. Implementation uptake could be enhanced through wider engagement with GPs prior to the intervention, engaging the clinical pharmacist to formally follow-up with senior RNs and GPs post-intervention, repeated reinforcement of the potential benefits of simplification suggested by stakeholders (e.g., reduced interruptions for residents, reduced time-related pressure on staff decision-making, and more time for staff to devote to resident interactions, clinical documentation, handover, and provision of non-pharmacological interventions for residents with dementia) and via resident and family discussions, to further enhance the reduction in the number of medication administration times observed in the intervention arm of the SIMPLER study (i.e., the primary outcome) during follow-up [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>The SIMPLER intervention was delivered as a stand-alone clinical service. Participants identified opportunities for integrating medication simplification into routine practice, suggesting that simplification could be incorporated into a pre-admission ‘package’ of activities that a pharmacist provides on RACF admission and thereafter, either when clinical circumstances change or at routine intervals. Transitions of care are considered a risky period for medication safety due to changes in medication use and healthcare providers [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and medication reconciliation is recommended before undertaking simplification [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; hence, provision at RACF entry is a timely opportunity for intervention. One participant suggested that prescribers could use MRS GRACE to guide simplification when preparing new medication charts as a potential point for future intervention. Previous studies in other settings have utilized screening tools, algorithms and/or electronic medication chart prompts to identify individuals with complex medication regimens [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, in the Australian state of Victoria, a medication quality indicator ‘percentage of residents with more than four medication administration times’ was developed, validated and implemented across all 180 public-sector RACFs as a prompt to reduce unnecessary complexity [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similar approaches could be considered to identify residents who may benefit from simplification. The sustained reduction in the number of medication administration times at 8- and 12-month follow-up of the SIMPLER study [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], observed after the process evaluation was conducted, provides further support for medication simplification to be delivered at least annually.</p>
              <p>Features of other successful RACF interventions, such as clinical champions, interdisciplinary collaboration, and good working relationships [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] were identified as facilitators to wider implementation. Remuneration for stakeholders was also considered important, which is consistent with findings of a process evaluation of medication intervention trial in Belgium RACFs [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Undertaking an economic evaluation that considers the benefits and costs of the SIMPLER intervention may also facilitate wider uptake. Employment of pharmacists to deliver clinical and educational services, and contribute to clinical governance activities in RACFs is an area of increasing focus in Australia [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The recent Australian Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety recommended regular RMMR provision for residents, and for pharmacists to be engaged by aged care provider organizations to provide clinical services [<xref rid="B44-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, in situations where clinical pharmacy services are not routinely provided, stakeholders suggested the simplification intervention could be incorporated into the following existing RACF-based services: (i) a RMMR (an Australian Government-funded comprehensive medication review for residents of RACFs) that is delivered to an individual resident or (ii) a Quality Use of Medicines activity which provides facility-level support (e.g., educational or continuous quality improvement initiatives) to enhance medicines use [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Pharmacists integrating simplification activities into their usual practice in RACFs would already have established relationships with stakeholders, which could address some of the recruitment and implementation barriers encountered in SIMPLER. Additionally, recent RMMR program changes that enable pharmacists to provide up to two follow-up visits [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] would enable pharmacists to follow-up on simplification recommendations made during an RMMR and prompt implementation if appropriate.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>This mixed-methods process evaluation was guided by a framework for cluster RCTs [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and explored an area of need. Comprehensive SIMPLER recruitment logs enabled us to extract information about why informed consent was not provided for some, but not all residents. Hence, we were unable to determine relationships between specific resident-related factors that may have made it difficult to participate in research (e.g., frailty, independence with activities of daily living [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) and participation in SIMPLER. We did not collect information on the reasons why third-party contact was required during recruitment. Additionally, the retrospective nature of the document analysis meant the total number of attempts made by research nurses to have a face-to-face resident recruitment discussion is likely underestimated. The time spent delivering the intervention by the single pharmacist may not be representative of all pharmacists. We suggest future studies collect information on time spent on other activities (e.g., organizing resident/family discussions, implementing recommendations) to guide future implementation and remuneration decisions.</p>
                <p>Importantly, views from most stakeholder groups were captured, except for residents who declined to participate in SIMPLER. Only one GP could be interviewed, and their views may not be representative of other GPs, particularly those who chose not to implement recommendations. We did not seek input from allied health professionals on the impact of the intervention. Interview questions were piloted beforehand, however as both interviewers had a pharmacy background this could have biased discussions towards pharmacist-related priorities. Implementation fidelity was assessed through pharmacist self-report and document analysis, however prospective measures (e.g., repeated pharmacist training, checklists, and direct observation and feedback [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-18-05778" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) are recommended in future studies.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>This process evaluation found the SIMPLER study was generally delivered as planned and in accordance with the study protocol. All of the RACFs approached agreed to participate. Although recruitment was resource intensive, a representative sample of residents was recruited. No major issues were found with the trial processes or implementation of the intervention, and any unintended consequences were largely perceived as beneficial. Stakeholders were supportive of wider implementation of medication simplification. Opportunities exist to integrate medication simplification into routine practice, with only minor modifications suggested by stakeholders. </p>
              <p>The barriers and enablers identified in this process evaluation can inform future interventions to optimize medication management in RACFs. We suggest ensuring sufficient time and resources are allocated for face-to-face recruitment discussions, continual promotional activities, and utilizing recruitment strategies that draw on altruism, build trust with potential participants and address concerns about potential changes to medications. Overall findings suggest that an appreciation for the potential benefit of the intervention, effective communication between stakeholders (including residents and family members) and good working relationships are vital for successful implementation of medication management interventions in RACFs.</p>
