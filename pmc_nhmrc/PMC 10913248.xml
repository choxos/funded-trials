                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Clinical practice guidelines recommend against the routine use of psychotropic medications in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Knowledge brokers are individuals or groups who facilitate the transfer of knowledge into practice. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using knowledge brokers to translate Australia’s new Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Appropriate Use of Psychotropic Medications in People Living with Dementia and in Residential Aged Care.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">The Evidence-based Medication knowledge Brokers in Residential Aged CarE (EMBRACE) trial is a helix-counterbalanced randomised controlled trial. The 12-month trial will be conducted in up to 19 RACFs operated by four Australian aged care provider organisations in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland. RACFs will be randomised to receive three levels of implementation strategies (knowledge broker service, pharmacist-led quality use of medications education activities and distribution of the Guidelines and supporting materials) across three medication contexts (antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants). Implementation strategies will be delivered by an embedded on-site aged care pharmacist working at a system level across each participating RACF. All RACFs will receive all implementation strategies simultaneously but for different medication contexts. The primary outcome will be a composite dichotomous measure of 6-month RACF-level concordance with Guideline recommendations and good practice statements among people using antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants for changed behaviours. Secondary outcomes will include proportion of residents with Guideline concordant use of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants measured at the RACF-level and proportion of residents with psychotropic medication use, hospitalisation, falls, falls with injury, polypharmacy, quality of life, activities of daily living, medication incidents and behavioural incidents measured at the RACF-level.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">The EMBRACE trial investigates a novel guideline implementation strategy to improve the safe and effective use of psychotropic medications in RACFs. We anticipate that the findings will provide new information on the potential role of knowledge brokers for successful and cost-effective guideline implementation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par17">Persistent high rates of psychotropic medication use in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) remain a concern for residents, caregivers and other stakeholders. This is despite a lack of evidence supporting benefits of psychotropic medication but well-documented risks of harm. More than 60% of Australian RACF residents use regular psychotropic medications, with 41% prescribed antidepressants, 22% antipsychotics and 22% benzodiazepines on a regular basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Psychotropic medication prevalence is also highly variable, with a study across 27 RACFs in the state of Victoria reporting antipsychotic prevalence ranged from 0 to 95% (mean 32%) and antidepressant prevalence ranged from 10 to 89% (mean 48%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">The American Psychiatric Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], European Academy of Neurology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines and Principles of Care for People with Dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] recommend avoiding antipsychotics in people living with dementia. Evidence suggests antipsychotics are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, falls and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Benzodiazepines are associated with minimal and short-term improvements in sleep disturbances but also with an increased risk of hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Antidepressants have uncertain benefits in people living with dementia and have been associated with adverse events including dry mouth, dizziness and falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">In October 2019, Australia’s Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety identified overreliance on psychotropic medications for chemical restraint as one of three areas for immediate action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Dementia Centre for Research Collaboration subsequently commissioned new Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Appropriate Use of Psychotropic Medications in People Living with Dementia and in Residential Aged Care (the Guidelines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The Guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary 18-member Guideline Development Group, supported by a Stakeholder Advisory Committee comprising government agencies, professional groups, aged care provider organisations and quality improvement organisations. The Guidelines were developed using an integrated knowledge translation process in collaboration with five aged care provider organisations in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Ongoing focus groups with these organisations suggested that innovative guideline implementation strategies would be needed to fully implement guideline recommendations and good practice statements.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Poor implementation of guideline recommendations is recognised as a barrier to reducing medication-related harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is emerging interest in engaging knowledge brokers to support guideline implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Knowledge brokers are individuals or groups that help to move knowledge from those who create the knowledge (e.g. guideline developers) to those that use the knowledge (e.g. health care professionals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Knowledge brokers act as knowledge managers, linking agents and capacity builders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The role of a knowledge broker is consistent with the Australian Government’s recent announcement of AUD $345.7 million over 4 years for on-site embedded pharmacists in all Government-funded RACFs to improve medication safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Quality Use of Medicines (QUM) and Medicines Safety is also Australia’s newest National Health Priority Area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In recognition that evidence-based recommendations alone are not sufficient to ensure guideline-concordant appropriate medication use, we developed a series of data-driven knowledge translation strategies for implementing the new Guidelines.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using knowledge brokers to translate Australia’s new Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Appropriate Use of Psychotropic Medications in People Living with Dementia and in Residential Aged Care. Guideline implementation using knowledge brokers will be compared to guideline implementation through the following: (1) distribution of the Guidelines and supporting materials and (2) pharmacist-led QUM education activities.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p id="Par28">The trial will be conducted in up to 19 RACFs operated by four aged care provider organisations in the states of Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland. The four aged care provider organisations are non-government, independent and not-for-profit organisations. Australian RACFs provide supported accommodation for people with care needs that can no longer be met in their own homes and are synonymous with long-term care facilities and nursing homes in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Approximately, two thirds (65%) of residents in Australian RACFs are women, and 58% of residents are aged 85 years and over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In Australian RACFs, medications are mostly prescribed by visiting medical practitioners, dispensed by off-site community pharmacies and administered by registered nurses or credentialled aged care workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Each aged care provider organisation’s leadership team will be responsible for identifying the specific RACFs operated by that organisation to take part in the trial. The trial protocol conforms to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The trial has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (registration no.: ACTRN12623001141639, date registered: 06/11/2023). The application for trial registration was submitted on the 20th of September 2023 (as shown on the ANZCTR trial registration site) prior to randomisation of RACFs, but the trial was not formally registered until 6th November 2023. There were no changes to the trial protocol between the submission date (20th of September 2023) and the registration date (6 November 2023).</p>

                <title>Governance and consultation</title>
                <p id="Par29">The trial will be overseen by the Project Management Team comprising the lead investigators and project manager. During the trial, the Project Management Team will meet with the aged care provider organisation representatives and knowledge brokers monthly or more frequently if required to monitor the data collection and conduct of the trial and to identify any potential adverse events. Meetings will mostly be conducted via video-teleconferencing (e.g. Zoom), with face-to-face meetings organised if needed.</p>
                <p id="Par30">The trial will be supported by a stakeholder group comprising government agencies (Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care), professional groups (Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, Australian and New Zealand Society of Geriatric Medicine, Australian College of Nursing, Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, Pharmacy Guild of Australia), and an advocacy body (Dementia Australia). The stakeholder group will meet annually for the duration of the trial including at implementation, evaluation and dissemination stages. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will meet as and when required during the trial. It will involve an independent group of healthcare professionals with relevant clinical expertise (e.g. general practitioner, geriatrician, nurse, pharmacist).</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p id="Par31">This trial will involve RACF-level interventions, and individual residents will not be recruited to participate. The unit of randomisation will be RACFs. Once potential availability of specific RACFs is determined by each aged care provider organisation, the RACF manager or an authorised representative of the aged care provider organisation will be provided with a written explanatory statement, and informed consent to participate will be obtained.</p>
                <p id="Par32">RACFs will be matched into blocks of three based on the aged care provider organisation and geographical location. One RACF within each block of three will be randomised to groups A, B, or C and receive three levels of intervention for a combination of implementation strategies and medication contexts (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Randomisation will be performed by an independent epidemiologist using a computerised random number generator within SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p>
                <p id="Par33">Following randomisation, each aged care provider organisation leadership team and their knowledge brokers will be notified of group allocations for each participating RACF within their organisation. Due to the nature of the trial, it will not be possible to blind the leadership team or knowledge brokers. Partial disclosure will be implemented for RACF nurses, aged care workers and visiting pharmacist and medical practitioners at each RACF. These clinicians and staff will be aware of the trial objectives and implementation strategies but will be blinded to the RACF group allocation. The availability of the knowledge broker service will be communicated via letters, posters and notice boards. Residents and their families will be made aware of the trial through distribution of notices and posters at each RACF. The primary outcome will be analysed by a blinded statistician or epidemiologist. The Project Management Team will not be blinded to the group allocations.</p>

These data will be fed-back to participating RACFs on a quarterly basis using an electronic dashboard system developed by Aspect Health. Aspect Health is a Queensland-based medication management provider. Aggregated non-identifiable data will be treated confidentially and stored on Aspect Health’s secure server. Each RACF will be able to view their Guideline concordance, compared against the Guideline concordance across their organisation and compared against national Guideline concordance (i.e. aggregate concordance of all participating RACFs) via a secure, password-protected login process. Aggregated data will be reported as proportions or percentages to avoid any potential for RACF re-identification. Aggregated Guideline concordance will be used by the knowledge broker to evaluate quality improvement initiatives and facilitate benchmarking across RACFs and aged care provider organisations.</p>

                <p id="Par82">The sample size of 19 RACFs was deemed to have sufficient statistical power. To estimate the statistical power of the helix, counterbalanced, three-strategy, and three-context area (medication type) trial design, we performed 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using Stata/SE Statistical Software: Release 17.0 (StataCorp. 2021). The sample size analysis was conducted at the RACF level based on the primary outcome (i.e. proportion of RACF-level Guideline concordant use of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants). The sample size was based on conducting analysis using a linear mixed model employing fixed, categorical factors for medication type and guideline implementation strategy and RACF as a random intercept. We assumed a minimum important effect size of an absolute change in the proportion of concordant medication category takers of 5% for the level 2 strategy relative to level 1 strategy and of 15% for the level 3 strategy relative to level 1 strategy. Given these assumptions, our sample size of 19 RACFs provides &gt; 99% power to detect the absolute change in proportion of concordant medication category takers of 15% and 81% power to detect the absolute change in proportion of 5%.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par91">The EMBRACE trial investigates a novel guideline implementation strategy to improve the implementation of evidence into practice in the RACF setting and directly addresses national and international priority areas: ‘Medication Without Harm’ is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Third Global Patient Safety Challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The EMBRACE trial also addresses dementia as an Australian National Health Priority Area, consistent with the WHO Global Action Plan on Dementia 2017–2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par92">Complaints about medications are among the leading sources of complaints to Australia’s Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In addressing medication appropriateness, the trial addresses a key concern of consumers and carers. Psychotropic medications contribute to 2.1% of all hospitalisations and 11.3% of all medication harm-related hospitalisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The trial directly addresses the need for new models of guideline implementation to promote safe and effective psychotropic medication use. Outcomes relating to intervention sustainability are consistent with the need for evidence to inform policy and practice change.</p>
              <p id="Par93">This trial will be the first to evaluate the novel role of system-level knowledge broker pharmacists to facilitate guideline implementation in RACFs. On-site aged care pharmacists are potentially well placed to deliver this intervention, with a recent pharmacist-led multicomponent intervention demonstrating 44% reduction in antipsychotic medication use compared to the control group at 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The knowledge brokers will be on-site and embedded as part of the RACF team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and have greater opportunity to lead system-level quality improvement initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The findings of this trial will address the absence of high-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of knowledge brokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and inform RACF and government funding and resource allocation decisions for potential future roll-out or expansion of the knowledge broker pharmacist role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par94">The EMBRACE trial uses a helix-counterbalanced study design, which provides several advantages over cluster randomised or stepped-wedge designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Firstly, it is not necessary to adjust for RACF characteristics because each RACF provides data for each implementation strategy. Secondly, all participating RACFs will receive all implementation strategies. This will help to maintain engagement of those RACFs which would otherwise have been randomised to the control group. Finally, the implementation strategies can be delivered simultaneously rather than sequentially as in a stepped-wedge design.</p>
              <p id="Par95">The EMBRACE trial will generate important knowledge about guideline implementation and knowledge brokers that can be used to scale up the intervention across Australia, inform application to other therapeutic areas and contexts, and improve the delivery of healthcare to all residents living in RACFs.</p>

                <p id="Par96">The trial has received Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee approval (ID 35525). The research will be conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. The trial evaluates RACF-level interventions, and individual residents will not be recruited to participate. The aged care provider organisations were partners in the application for grant funding. RACF-level consent to participate was obtained from an authorised representative of the aged care provider organisation or RACF manager. If an aged care provider organisation or RACF manager decides to withdraw throughout the trial, data that have been collected prior to withdrawal will be included in the data analysis if permitted. No new data will be collected after the aged care provider organisation or RACF has withdrawn from the trial. Any planned changes in the protocol will be approved by the ethics committee, communicated to relevant stakeholders, and updated in the ANZCTR.</p>
