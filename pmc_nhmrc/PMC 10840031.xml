                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The objective of this parallel group, randomised controlled trial is to evaluate a community health navigator (CHN) intervention provided to patients aged over 40 years and living with chronic health conditions to transition from hospital inpatient care to their homes. Unplanned hospital readmissions are costly for the health system and negatively impact patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Patients are randomised post hospital discharge to the CHN intervention or usual care. A comparison of outcomes between intervention and control groups will use multivariate regression techniques that adjust for age, sex and any independent variables that are significantly different between the two groups, using multiple imputation for missing values. Time-to-event analysis will examine the relationship between seeing a CHN following discharge from the index hospitalisation and reduced rehospitalisations in the subsequent 60 days and 6 months. Secondary outcomes include medication adherence, health literacy, quality of life, experience of healthcare and health service use (including the cost of care). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the implementation of the navigator role from the viewpoint of stakeholders including patients, health professionals and the navigators themselves.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Avoidable hospital readmission occurs when a patient is discharged from an index hospital admission and subsequently has a further, related and unplanned admission, that was potentially preventable.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Readmission rates present a challenge in many countries and are an accepted indicator of the quality of hospital care.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Unplanned hospital readmission may result due to exacerbation of underlying disease,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> comorbidity,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> inadequately planned transitions of care between hospital and the home<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and failure to follow medication changes made while in hospital.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Older patients (&gt;65 years) represent a significant proportion of these readmissions,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4</xref> and factors exacerbating readmission include being from a culturally or linguistically diverse (CALD) background, living in poor housing, suffering from functional disability, having admissions prior to the index admission and having a longer length of stay during the index admission.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Reducing readmission rates to improve the efficiency and financial sustainability of the healthcare system is a major government priority. Currently, unplanned readmissions cost Australia approximately A$1.5 billion annually.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In New South Wales (NSW) (Australia’s most populated state) between 2015 and 2018, readmission rates within 30 days postindex discharge varied between 10% (for ischaemic stroke) and 22% (for cardiac failure).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Standard hospital discharge procedures within NSW hospitals mandate discharge care coordination. This includes liaison with all care providers including the patient’s general practitioner (GP) and referral to relevant follow-up services. A detailed discharge summary should be provided to all relevant persons including treating health professionals and the patient and/or their families, which includes medication information, community and GP referral information, follow-up appointments and patient educational resources. Patients are provided with a 2–7-day supply of discharge medications.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, communication and coordination have not always been optimal in Australia contributing to readmission.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref></p>
              <p>Strategies aimed at reducing unplanned readmissions have been trialled with variable success. These include improving the interface between hospitals and primary care, the use of GPs and pharmacists to conduct medicine reconciliation and improved discharge planning and follow-up processes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Various models have also been developed which aim to improve the transfer of inpatients back to their homes, including the use of community health workers (CHWs) or community health navigators (CHNs). Within this paper, we use these terms interchangeably. The American Public Health Association describes CHWs as ‘frontline public health workers who are trusted members of and /or have an unusually close understanding of the community served’.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Particularly within the USA, CHWs have been successfully engaged to improve chronic disease management, particularly hypertension, diabetes and asthma.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Internationally, CHWs undertake a variety of roles including helping to navigate health services.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Navigation has been shown to reduce admission and readmission rates and improve access to health and social care for disadvantaged groups, especially indigenous and CALD populations.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 16</xref> In a systematic review of the impact of CHWs on the use of healthcare services in the USA, 42% of the RCTs that measured emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisations or urgent care visits found that CHW interventions resulted in a decrease in the use of services relative to control groups.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, the majority of CHW interventions were cost saving and low cost (less than US$ 1500 per patient per year). Research from Canada indicates that CHWs can play a role in reducing barriers to service access for marginalised populations, help identify emerging needs among communities and aid the health system in preventing families from falling through service gaps.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>

                  <title>Primary hypothesis</title>
                  <p>The primary hypothesis is that intervention-group participants will have 50% fewer hospital readmissions (from 20% to 10%), in the first 60 days postdischarge (as this is the duration of the CHN intervention) when compared with the control group.</p>

                  <title>Secondary hypotheses</title>
                  <p>In comparison with the control group, intervention group participants will, at 3 months, have higher rates of self-reported medication adherence and improved health literacy. In addition, intervention group participants will, at 6 months postdischarge, report higher rates of patient-centred care and quality of life.</p>
                  <p>Our hypothesis in relation to the cost of the intervention is that health service use will be more appropriate (higher rates of GP management plans and team care arrangements and fewer ED presentations) and that the total health service cost in the intervention group will be less than the control group at 6 months.</p>

                <p>Patients are screened immediately postdischarge from one of the four public hospitals (Royal Prince Alfred, Balmain, Canterbury and Concord) in SLHD, Australia. SLHD is located in the central/west of Sydney covering 126 km<sup>2</sup> with approximately 740 000 residents. Eligibility is assessed using the NSW Health Patient Flow Portal and the electronic medical record (eMR). The portal includes an integrated care module that has an e-enabled Risk of Hospitalisation (RoH) algorithm that flags patients with a chronic condition at RoH within 12 months (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

Verbal consent to participate will be recorded using an approved Ethics Verbal Consent Template (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 2</xref>). Once consented, the RO will administer the baseline survey and enter it into an online platform (REDCap). All consenting patients will receive a mailed package containing the patient information sheet, withdrawal of consent form and a copy of the completed verbal consent form.</p>

                <p>Three CHN positions are located within the planned care team. This multidisciplinary team is part of an Integrated Care Initiative by the NSW Ministry of Health called the Planned Care for Better Health (PCBH) programme which aims to identify patients at RoH early and strengthen the care provided to them.</p>
                <p>Although CHNs are used within international and Australian contexts, the scope of practice, backgrounds and parameters of the role can vary,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and the optimal design of the role in different contexts is yet to be established.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Within this trial, CHNs have a certificate or higher in community care or aged care (healthcare assistant) and/or experience in a relevant field. Some CHN roles are specifically designed to be representative through shared culture. Although speaking a second language is an advantage in this role, it is not essential given the number of cultural groups within SLHD. The role is designed to build knowledge and interpersonal and communication skills which foster rapport with clients, develop awareness of the unique challenges facing this cohort and demonstrate an ability to use the clinical and social support resources within the SLHD to intervene in the health and social and psychological care of their clients in a meaningful way.</p>

An online training programme (12 modules) has been developed, each comprising a presentation with audio, supporting notes, videos, additional reading materials and a quiz (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Module content is based on previous SLHD programmes,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> research in general practice<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> and stakeholder consultation through a codesign workshop.

Our hypothesis is that health service use will be more appropriate (higher proportion of team care arrangements and fewer ED presentations) and that the total cost in the intervention group will be less than the control group at 6 months. Patient consent to link to medical claims through MBS and dispensing of medications on the PBS will be sought at the 6-month follow-up and be undertaken in accordance with the Commonwealth Department of Human Services which governs the ethical and collection processes relating to these data. The benefit of the intervention will be primarily measured by a gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the intervention group as compared with the control group. An economic evaluation will be carried out on ‘intent-to-treat’ basis based on the cost utility framework. The main outcome will be additional costs incurred for QALY gain under CHN intervention compared with usual care (control group). This will be presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)—incremental cost divided by incremental QALY gain. Further non-parametric bootstrapping will be used as part of sensitivity analysis to check the reliability of results by measuring the uncertainty in the estimate of ICER.</p>

Our primary analysis to measure the effect of the intervention will be on an intention-to-treat basis in which outcomes will be compared between the group of patients allocated to the control and the group allocated to the intervention irrespective of having any CHN visits. To measure the effect of the intervention against the unplanned readmission within 60 days of discharge from the index hospitalisation, we will do a time-to-event analysis. As a sensitivity analysis, we will do per-protocol analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes—comparing no intervention and intervention as per <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>. We will use difference-in-difference method to measure the effect of the intervention against the secondary outcomes, patient-reported medication adherence, patient-reported health literacy, patient-reported quality of life and patient-reported assessment of chronic illness. A comparison of outcomes between intervention and control groups will use multivariate regression techniques that adjust for age, sex and any independent variables that are significantly different between the two groups, using multiple imputation for missing values. Baseline characteristics of those lost to follow-up will be analysed. Demographics of non-participants and reasons for dropout will be collected to assess bias.</p>

              <p>This trial will test a CHN intervention integrated within an existing health service that is designed to support the patient’s transition from the hospital back to the community. Through a robust randomised controlled design, we aim to determine if providing an intervention by a CHN for patients with long-term condition(s) and social and/or psychological vulnerability generates reductions in unplanned hospital readmission (60 days) and improves medication adherence, health literacy, quality of life, experience of healthcare and health service use (including the cost of care) compared with usual care.</p>
              <p>The trial is underpinned by a multi-stakeholder partnership of health planners, hospital clinicians and discharge care providers, primary care providers and consumer groups who will guide the study process and evaluation. These stakeholders have joined with us in codesigning this study to evaluate the effectiveness and cost of CHN follow-up of patients after discharge as a key strategy in preventing rehospitalisation.</p>
              <p>This trial will also help to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the role in a real-world health setting. If found to be effective, the trial will have important implications for policy regarding the development of CHN roles in the Australian health system including codesigning of their training, accreditation, supervision and funding.</p>
