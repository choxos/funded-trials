                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The continuing morbidity and mortality associated with infection with malaria parasites highlights the urgent need for a vaccine. The efficacy of sub-unit vaccines tested in clinical trials in malaria-endemic areas has thus far been disappointing, sparking renewed interest in the whole parasite vaccine approach. We previously showed that a chemically attenuated whole parasite asexual blood-stage vaccine induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent protection against challenge with homologous and heterologous parasites in rodent models of malaria.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In this current study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of chemically attenuated asexual blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Pf) parasites in eight malaria-na√Øve human volunteers. Study participants received a single dose of 3‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>7</sup> Pf pRBC that had been treated in vitro with the cyclopropylpyrolloindole analogue, tafuramycin-A.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">We demonstrate that Pf asexual blood-stage parasites that are completely attenuated are immunogenic, safe and well tolerated in malaria-na√Øve volunteers. Following vaccination with a single dose, species and strain transcending <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific T cell responses were induced in recipients. This included induction of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific lymphoproliferative responses, T cells secreting the parasiticidal cytokines, IFN-Œ≥ and TNF, and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory T cells. Pf-specific IgG was not detected.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This is the first clinical study evaluating a whole parasite blood-stage malaria vaccine. Following administration of a single dose of completely attenuated Pf asexual blood-stage parasites, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific T cell responses were induced while Pf-specific antibodies were not detected. These results support further evaluation of this chemically attenuated vaccine in humans.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par37"><italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. parasites cause more than 200 million clinical cases of malaria and 438,000 deaths per year, with the majority of deaths occurring in children &lt;‚Äâ5¬†years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. An effective vaccine capable of inducing long-lasting immunity is not currently available. Disappointing results following the testing of sub-unit vaccines in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have highlighted some of the limitations of sub-unit vaccines that need to be addressed, including antigenic polymorphism in critical epitopes.</p>
              <p id="Par38">The limited protection induced by sub-unit vaccine candidates has resulted in renewed interest in the whole organism vaccine approach. The fundamental rationale for a whole parasite vaccine is that by maximising the number of antigens presented to the immune system, including those that are conserved between different parasite strains, the impact of antigenic polymorphism will be diminished. There has been considerable progress with injectable whole parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The administration of whole blood-stage parasites in the context of controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in human volunteers is not new [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; deliberate malaria infection was used as a treatment for neurosyphilis (malariotherapy) in the early 1900s (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). CHMI with whole blood-stage parasites is also used for the in vivo assessment of malaria vaccine and drug candidate efficacy (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). However, there have been no published clinical studies of whole parasite blood-stage malaria vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par39">Cyclopropylpyrolloindole analogues, such as centanamycin (CM) and tafuramycin-A (TF-A) have been used to successfully attenuate both sporozoite and asexual blood-stage malaria parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These compounds bind covalently to poly-A regions of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Studies in mice involving vaccination with chemically attenuated sporozoites demonstrated induction of protective immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To adapt this for a blood-stage vaccine approach, we vaccinated mice with a single dose of ring-stage <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> AS parasitised red blood cells (pRBC) that had been treated in vitro with CM or the related compound, TF-A, and demonstrated long-lasting protection from homologous and heterologous blood-stage challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Similar protection was observed when mice were vaccinated with chemically attenuated <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> 17X, although three doses of vaccine provided superior protection compared to one dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although an adjuvant was not required for induction of protective immune responses, vaccine efficacy was ablated if the red cell membrane was disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These data suggested that the red cell membranes were required to target the attenuated parasites to dendritic cells in the spleen and liver, which was observed post-vaccination. Protective immunity was dependent on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells present at the time of challenge, and a strong IFN-Œ≥ response was induced by the vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Parasite-specific antibodies were induced only in the <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17X model and contributed to protection. Vaccination also led to a significant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response, although depletion of these cells did not ablate vaccine-induced immunity. In previous pre-clinical studies involving other types of whole parasite blood-stage vaccines, it was shown that cellular immunity or IFN-Œ≥ played critical roles in protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The importance of IFN-Œ≥ in immunity to human malaria has also been demonstrated in individuals in malaria-endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and in a controlled human experimental infection study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">To facilitate transition of the chemically attenuated vaccine approach into humans, pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (Pf) were undertaken. Treatment of parasites with 2¬†ŒºM CM resulted in complete parasite attenuation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In vivo studies in <italic>Aotus</italic> monkeys showed that following inoculation of TF-A-treated parasites, they persisted at sub-patent levels for up to 8¬†days (as determined by qPCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Pf-specific T cell responses, but not Pf-specific IgG, were induced. Collectively, these data supported the evaluation of this vaccine approach in clinical studies.</p>
              <p id="Par41">We previously manufactured clinical-grade cultured Pf asexual blood-stage cell banks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and demonstrated their infectivity in vivo in malaria-na√Øve volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this present study, we used the Pf 7G8 cell bank to investigate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of chemically attenuated parasites in malaria-na√Øve individuals.</p>

                <title>Aims and study participants</title>
                <p id="Par42">The main aims of the study were to (i) characterise the safety and tolerability of TF-A-treated Pf blood-stage parasites in humans and to (ii) characterise the immunogenicity of TF-A-treated Pf blood-stage parasites in humans. Griffith University was the study sponsor, and the study was conducted in the Clinical Trial Unit at Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia, from July 2014 to August 2015. Study participants were healthy male, malaria-na√Øve individuals, aged 18‚Äì60¬†years (<italic>n</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ8) (Additional¬†file¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Volunteers were excluded if they had a history of malaria infection or travelled to/lived (&gt;‚Äâ2¬†weeks) in a malaria-endemic country during the previous 12¬†months. Other key eligibility criteria can be found in the listing on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au">www.anzctr.org.au</ext-link>); the identifier is ACTRN12614000228684.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Study participants received a single vaccination of 3‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10<sup>7</sup>pRBC treated with 50¬†nM of TF-A (group A; <italic>n</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ3) or 200¬†nM of TF-A (group B; <italic>n</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ5) on study day 0. Follow-up visits were scheduled every 2¬†days (from study day 2 to day 26) following vaccination. At these visits, blood samples were collected to assess parasite levels in the blood of participants and to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine in established assays. If the numbers of parasites in the blood increased exponentially and levels reached 11,500 pRBC/ml (as measured by quantitative PCR [qPCR]) or clinical symptoms of malaria developed, rescue treatment with a standard course of the anti-malarial artemether-lumefantrine (A/L) (Riamet) was commenced immediately. If rescue treatment with A/L was not initiated, 4¬†weeks following administration of the vaccine (day 28), participants were given a standard course of A/L.</p>
                <p id="Par44">For safety assessments at every visit, participants were evaluated by a medical investigator. This included a physical exam, measurement of vital signs (e.g. temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate) and recording of solicited and unsolicited adverse events. Blood was also collected for safety purposes at designated scheduled visits (days 0, 8, 16, 28, 90) for group B. For group A, this was undertaken at days 0, 8, the day of initiation of anti-malarial treatment for each participant (days 10‚Äì13), days 28 and 90. Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology tested samples collected prior to immunisation, on day 28 and day 90 for the presence of alloantibodies. Indirect anti-globulin testing was undertaken using column agglutination technology. An independent Safety Review Team, including an independent medical expert, was appointed to oversee the study and monitor its progress.</p>

                <title>Culture of Pf for the production of chemically treated parasites</title>
                <p id="Par45">The culturing of Pf 7G8 for the production of chemically treated parasites was undertaken at Griffith University. All processes were carried out in compliance with Annex 13, Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) Guide, in a monitored environment suitable for production of sterile biologics in accordance with approved protocols. For group A (P1, P2, P3) and three participants in group B (P4, P5, P6), cultures were initiated using seed vials from the clinical-grade Pf 7G8 cell bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and were expanded using leukocyte-depleted group O RhD negative erythrocytes (Key Biologics, LLC, Memphis, TN, USA) as previously described for the production of the clinical-grade cell banks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For two participants in group B (P7 and P8), the Pf 7G8 cell bank was expanded in erythrocytes derived from the blood of the study participant. Parasite cultures were checked regularly, at which time, thin blood films were made from collected samples, stained with Diff Quik (Bacto Laboratories) and read to ascertain the parasitemia. As required, the parasites were sub-cultured using freshly washed human erythrocytes. This culturing process was continued with the number of tissue culture dishes/flasks increasing until the malaria parasite was at ring-stage, and it was calculated that there were sufficient parasite numbers to manufacture the chemically treated pRBC.</p>

                <p id="Par46">The 2¬†mM TF-A stock solution was prepared according to published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and aliquots were stored at ‚àí‚Äâ80¬†¬∞C. Fresh working stocks of 20¬†ŒºM were made from this as required, and serial dilutions were performed in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation, CA) to obtain the appropriate concentration of TF-A for the chemical treatment of pRBCs. Pf 7G8 cultures were centrifuged at 433<italic>g</italic> for 10¬†min, and the supernatant removed. The cell pellets were combined in a single tube, and a thin blood smear was prepared to determine parasitemia. The parasitemia of cultures for preparation of chemically treated pRBC was 3‚Äì5%. For each vented flask required, 500¬†Œºl of packed cells (pRBCs and uninfected red blood cells [uRBCs]) was added to 9¬†ml of pre-warmed RPMI-1640 medium. One millilitre of the appropriate TF-A solution was added to obtain a final concentration of either 50¬†nM (group A) or 200¬†nM of TF-A (group B). This cell suspension was incubated for 40¬†min in a 37¬†¬∞C incubator with 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 90% N<sub>2</sub>, and the flasks were gently agitated every 10¬†min. The packed cells were transferred to 50¬†ml conical tubes and washed with RPMI-1640 at 433<italic>g</italic> for 5¬†min, and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in RPMI-1640 and incubated at 37¬†¬∞C for a further 20¬†min. The pRBC were washed twice more with RPMI-1640 and a final wash in 0.9% saline for injection. Finally, the pellet was re-suspended in saline for injection and a cell count was performed to calculate the volume required for the immunising dose. This was re-suspended in saline for injection to give a final volume of 2¬†ml/dose.</p>

              <p id="Par76">Lymphoproliferative responses were examined, and as previously shown, all individuals had pre-existing responses to pRBC at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], despite no previous exposure to Pf. This responsiveness could be due to cross-reactivity between parasite antigens and environmental organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Critically, the responses to homologous pRBC increased following inoculation in individuals who received completely attenuated chemically treated Pf 7G8 (group B), and they persisted in a proportion of individuals for up to 90¬†days (the duration of the study). Proliferative responses to heterologous parasites were also observed in more than half of these individuals. It is possible that administration of additional doses of attenuated parasites will augment the breadth, magnitude and persistence of this response. Cytokine production in response to homologous parasites was also examined, and increased production of IFN-Œ≥ and TNF (as measured in culture supernatants) was observed following inoculation. Both IFN-Œ≥ and TNF are strongly implicated in protection against Pf infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and the latter also in pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Increased levels of IL-10 were also observed; it is a regulatory cytokine thought to play a crucial role in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. infection, due to its ability to regulate both innate and adaptive inflammatory responses, e.g. production of TNF (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]).</p>
              <p id="Par77">By using intracellular cytokine staining, we further examined production of IFN-Œ≥, TNF and IL-2 by CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells. In group B, T cells secreting IFN-Œ≥ alone or in combination with TNF were the most frequently detected; however, a significant increase following vaccination was only seen at day 14 for CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells secreting IFN-Œ≥ alone. Previous studies on malaria and other infectious diseases have demonstrated a correlation between the presence of antigen-specific polyfunctional T cells and protective immunity induced following vaccination (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]). Although the prevalence of these cells was low and the increases in these populations following vaccination were not significant, administration of additional vaccine doses may increase their prevalence and longevity. Future studies examining the protective efficacy of a chemically attenuated whole blood-stage parasite vaccine should examine the role of these polyfunctional T cells in protection. Importantly, we also observed the induction of cytokine-secreting memory T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>) following inoculation. It would be of interest in future studies to undertake additional phenotyping to examine the pluripotency of this memory T cell population. Analysis of the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets following inoculation showed that there was a significant increase at day 14 in CD4<sup>+</sup> and Œ≥Œ¥ T cells producing TNF and in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-Œ≥.</p>
              <p id="Par78">Pf-specific IgM was detected only in individuals who developed an active malaria infection (group A). The lack of antibody production in group B may be a function of antigen dose, as they were exposed to a lower dose of parasites. It is possible that with administration of further doses of the completely attenuated parasites, an antibody response may be induced.</p>
              <p id="Par79">In a previous clinical study investigating the protective efficacy of multiple low-dose Pf infections attenuated in vivo with atovaquone/proguanil, we observed protection against homologous challenge in three out of four volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, we could not exclude that protection was due in part to residual drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Pf-specific cellular immune responses were induced in the absence of Pf-specific antibody in that study, similarly to what we observed in the current study. However, the requirement for delayed anti-malarial drug administration is problematic for the feasibility of this in vivo treatment approach as a vaccine strategy. Our current approach of in vitro treatment of pRBC prior to administration offers a viable alternative.</p>
              <p id="Par80">Induction of parasite-specific cellular immune responses, in the absence of antibodies, was observed in previous rodent studies evaluating the protective efficacy of chemically attenuated <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> pRBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This is similar to what we observed in the current study, and it differs from the <italic>P. yoelii</italic> 17X rodent studies, where parasite-specific antibodies were also induced in addition to the cellular immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A further study involving administration of chemically treated Pf FVO parasites to non-splenectomised <italic>Aotus</italic> monkeys demonstrated induction of Pf-specific cellular responses in the absence of IgG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Following a single dose of chemically treated parasites, the vaccinated monkeys received a homologous blood-stage challenge with all developing parasitemia and requiring anti-malarial drug treatment. This suggests that more than one vaccine dose may be required for clinical protection.</p>
              <p id="Par81">Rodent studies investigating chemically attenuated <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. suggest that persistence of low levels of parasite antigen may be important for inducing an antibody-independent protective immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although persisting parasites could not be detected in this current study beyond day 2 post-inoculation, it is possible that they were persisting at levels below the limit of detection of the qPCR.</p>
              <p id="Par82">The development and clinical evaluation of this whole parasite asexual blood-stage vaccine approach presented a number of general and specific issues for consideration. The use of human red blood cells in the manufacturing process and the final vaccine product entailed specific regulatory and safety considerations, specifically the possibility of contamination with infectious adventitious agents and allo-immunisation. To address the first issue, we used transfusion-compatible blood products, with collection and screening undertaken according to current regulatory guidelines, and used a defined malaria parasite cell bank grown at Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standard that had also been rigorously screened according to regulatory guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, the manufacturing process complied with current, local GMP requirements. The second issue, the possibility of allo-immunisation (the induction of antibodies against red blood cell antigens), was addressed by the use of blood from a group O RhD negative donor to manufacture the inoculum for group A and the first three participants in group B (P4-P6). In one study participant, P6, seroconversion to the minor Rh antigen ‚Äúc‚Äù was observed following inoculation. As the Rh phenotype of the donor red blood cells that were used to manufacture the inoculum for the first three participants in group B were ‚Äúce‚Äù while P6‚Äôs phenotype was ‚ÄúCDe‚Äù, it is likely that the induction of ‚Äúc‚Äù antibodies may have been due to injection with the chemically treated pRBC. Seroconversion was not observed in P1‚ÄìP5 despite incompatibility with the donor red blood cells at the minor Rh antigens. Although it is not feasible to match donor blood with recipients at all of the minor Rh antigens, following this observation, the inocula for P7 and P8 were manufactured individually using their own red blood cells. In this current study, the inocula were prepared from cultures with a 5% parasitemia; thus, the total number of red blood cells being injected was 20-fold higher than the number of pRBC. To progress this vaccine strategy and to address the possible induction of alloantibodies, we believe it is critical to reduce the number of red blood cells in the inocula, which could be achieved by purifying the pRBC away from the uninfected red blood cells. This current study involved the administration of only a single dose of Pf pRBC; the impact of multiple doses of Pf pRBC on the induction of alloantibodies is being examined in ongoing studies.</p>
              <p id="Par83">TF-A is a compound with genotoxic potential, and while the majority is washed away during the manufacturing process, its use required the measurement of residual TF-A in an inoculum dose for each manufactured batch. According to the ‚ÄúEU Guidelines on the limits of Genotoxic Impurities‚Äù (which has been adopted by our local regulatory body, the Therapeutic Goods Administration), a value of 1.5¬†Œºg/day of genotoxic impurity is considered to be associated with acceptable risk. Notably, the US FDA stipulates a much higher threshold of 120¬†Œºg/day, and this is for up to 14¬†days of continuous administration. The amount of residual TF-A in our inoculum batches was considerably lower than both of these thresholds (group A: <italic>x</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ86.04¬†ng/vaccine dose; group B: <italic>x</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ114¬†ng/vaccine dose). Purification of pRBC away from uRBC would result in an¬†even further reduction in the amount of residual TF-A.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par84">This study represents the first clinical evaluation of chemically attenuated whole blood-stage parasites in malaria-na√Øve human volunteers. When the Pf parasites were completely attenuated, the inoculum was safe and well tolerated, although future studies may need to focus on the purification of pRBC (e.g. magnet purification of trophozoite-stage pRBC) for the inoculum to address the possibility of induction of alloantibodies. The induction of strain and species-transcending parasite-specific cellular immune responses following inoculation provides support for the whole blood-stage parasite approach as a means of increasing the breadth of the resulting immune response. While homologous and heterologous protection has been demonstrated in rodent models of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], it is not known whether these cross-reactive immune responses will be protective in humans. These data support further clinical development of chemically attenuated whole blood-stage parasites as a vaccine strategy. Future studies will focus on a multi-dose immunisation regimen and will address whether lower doses of attenuated parasites are immunogenic.</p>
