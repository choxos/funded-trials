                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Giving up driving is a pivotal life event and universal challenge for people living with dementia and their families, and a complex area of clinical practice for health professionals who monitor driving cessation. The best outcomes are for individuals to plan for and eventually cease driving, however with insufficient support programs in place, many avoid the issue until it is reaches a crisis point. This program of research investigates a comprehensive support- and education-based intervention targeted at people living with dementia and their care partners who are managing driving cessation. The primary aim of this research is to determine the effectiveness of the program through a cluster randomized controlled trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">The intervention (CarFreeMe) is an intensive program delivered by a trained health professional that addresses practical and emotional needs relevant to driving cessation. The seven module program is person-centred, covering awareness raising, adjustment, and practical support that is individualized according to geographic location and the particular goals and preferences of participants. A cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Evaluation will take place pre-intervention, immediately following, and three months post-intervention. Clusters are randomized to either intervention or usual treatment. Participants within clusters will be recruited via primary and secondary care clinics, community agencies, service providers, local media, social media, support groups, and word of mouth. The primary outcome measure for persons with dementia and their care partners is lifespace, collected via (i) smartphone GPS technology and (ii) self-reported number of episodes away from home (during the past week). Secondary outcomes include safe alternative transport status, wellbeing, depression, anxiety, and self-efficacy, which will be collected from dyads. Caregiving strain will be collected from care partner/family member only. A process evaluation of the intervention will also be undertaken.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">There is an urgent need for therapeutic approaches to supporting people living with dementia and their families to negotiate the complex decision making involved in deciding to change their approach to driving. The driving cessation intervention may fill an important gap in service delivery to people living with dementia who are adjusting to life without driving.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par11">Stopping driving impacts the health and quality of life of people with dementia and their care partners. It also poses considerable challenges to health professionals who monitor driving issues and to those involved in testing and licensing. Without intensive practical and emotional support to plan for, and eventually, cease driving, people with dementia are at high risk for increased depression, anxiety, grief, social isolation, unsafe and unlicensed driving and injury. We have developed a comprehensive support- and education-based intervention targeted at people with dementia and their care partners and family members to manage driving cessation. The intervention is a translation of a proven driving cessation intervention for people without cognitive decline and has been trialled in an intensive case study. This project investigates the effectiveness of the evidence-based driving cessation intervention for people with dementia and their family members who are retiring from driving, through a cluster randomized controlled trial.</p>
              <p id="Par12">A diagnosis of dementia does not mean the immediate cessation of driving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, at some stage people with dementia will need to stop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Without necessary support programs in place, many people living with dementia avoid the issue until it is reaches a crisis point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Health professionals acknowledge the complexity of driving and driving cessation issues for people with dementia, and studies identify that their lack of knowledge and confidence in managing driving cessation issues may lead to reluctance to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some drivers with dementia avoid their responsibility to stop driving even when their licence is terminated for emotional, logistical, and mobility reasons, or due to a lack of insight and awareness of the dangers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Driving cessation can diminish ‘lifespace’ – defined as the extent of movement through the environment that captures lived community mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] – constricted lifespace may lead to more rapid cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Timing of the decision to stop driving is critically important. If the decision to cease driving is delayed, then loss of insight into declining driving abilities exacerbates the challenges of stopping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The best outcome is for people with dementia and their care partners to plan early, and eventually cease driving. However, it is an extremely personal and difficult issue for people with dementia, and one that care partners and families fear confronting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, with limited available information about how to evaluate fitness-to-drive in primary care, and no practical interventions for people with dementia, it is a poorly resourced area of clinical dementia care. Despite the concerns for safety and recognition of the impact of driving cessation on quality of life, health and wellbeing of people with dementia and their care partners, there are currently no theory-driven, empirically tested interventions to facilitate driving cessation for people with dementia in routine clinical practice within Australia. The CarFreeMe (for people with dementia) intervention aims to fill the gap.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Preliminary work</title>
                <p id="Par14">The researchers have developed a comprehensive support and education-based driving cessation intervention, which is a translation of an effective community-based psychosocial intervention for people <italic>without</italic> cognitive decline: ‘CarFreeMe’ (formerly known as UQDRIVE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The translated intervention is aimed at the unique needs of drivers with dementia and their families. The effectiveness of the original CarFreeMe program, aimed at improving outcomes of driving cessation for older people without cognitive decline, has been systematically explored with a general older adult population in a randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The dementia specific intervention was pilot tested with a sample of drivers with dementia who had stopped driving and their family members in Brisbane, Queensland Australia [unpublished thesis]. Improvement in community mobility outcomes, self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], individualized transport and lifestyle goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and high levels of satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have been reported by participants within CarFreeMe programs. The current program of research will implement a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) examining face-to-face delivery of the dementia specific intervention to people living with dementia in the community, in Queensland, Australia.</p>

                <p id="Par28">A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted with regions (electoral districts) used as the unit of randomisation, to minimize the risk of contamination between conditions. Cluster randomisation aims to also address possible attrition, as participants will not be made aware of an alternative group. Clusters will be matched so that pairs of regions are as similar as possible on demographics, and potential local area transport and health infrastructure, to increase efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Clusters will be randomized using concealed allocation to either the intervention or waitlist control group. Randomisation to treatment or wait-list control condition will occur before baseline measurement. During a period of baseline data collection, no cluster will be exposed to the intervention. After baseline, one will proceed to the intervention arm, while the other will proceed to the wait-list ‘treatment as usual’ (ie. no intervention, written information, pamphlets) control arm – to receive the intervention at a later time (after Time 3, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Abridged CONSORT diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12877_2019_1074_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Intervention description</title>
                <p id="Par32">CarFreeMe-for People with Dementia was developed in accordance with the four stages of the Medical Research Council’s framework (2000) for investigating health-related complex interventions. Stage 1 has been conducted in the preliminary work undertaken to identify the issues for driving cessation for people with dementia and their care partners. This informed the development of the seven-module CarFreeMe for People with Dementia intervention (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The content, language, format and activities were adapted from a proven driving cessation intervention for people without cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] for people with dementia and additional modules created for family members – whose involvement is key. The adaptation was reviewed by an expert reference group and preliminary evaluations conducted within an intensive case study model. The CarFreeMe for People with Dementia intervention is designed to be person-centred and flexible in content and delivery, e.g. in-home, one-to-one, dyads, or small group settings. As part of its design, the intervention is individualized according to geographic location and the needs of participants. For example, older adults are encouraged to consider future transport arrangements, plan for lifestyle changes, form realistic expectations of life changes after driving cessation, and practice using alternative transport. Importantly, they are supported in their emotional adjustment to the role loss. The individualized program involves a combination of one-to-one sessions, groups, practical outings and activities with a local experienced health professional, as well as some home-based independent activities.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Structure and content of the intervention for people living with dementia</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Modules</th><th>Title and contact examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Module 1</td><td>Living with dementia: focuses on the changes that may occur with dementia, and strategies to live positively.</td></tr><tr><td>Module 2</td><td>Balancing independence and safety: provides information about driving safety in later life and things for consideration regarding retirement from driving.</td></tr><tr><td>Module 3</td><td>Adjusting to losses and changes: covers changes that may occur to lifestyle and feelings of loss and grief that may result from retiring from driving.

                <p id="Par33">The intervention includes seven modules that cover education and practical support, delivered by a health professional who is trained in, for example, occupational therapy, psychology, social work or nursing, and who is experienced in working in community care with older adults living with dementia and their family members. It is anticipated that trained health professionals will deliver the intervention to people with dementia and their families in their homes and/or community settings, in individual, or group sessions, or a combination of both – depending upon participant preference.</p>

                    <p id="Par39">The main outcome measure for persons with dementia and their family members is lifespace – the geographic space in which a person lives and conducts their activities. It is recognized that having dementia is likely to constrict a person’s lifespace and reduce their community participation. Lifespace will be captured through two measures, (i) the number of episodes away from home (during the past week); and (ii) novel Smartphone GPS technology used to passively measure lifespace metrics for people with dementia and their care partners. Participants will carry a study smartphone in a comfortable case (provided to them by the researcher – on loan and at no cost) for the period of one week pre- and one week post-intervention and one-week at three-month follow-up. Support is provided to make sure the purpose of the phone is understood and remembered by participants. Data stream to a secure portal and can enable the research team to identify if a problem with data collection has occurred. Family members are asked to remind the person with dementia to wear the smartphone. While the limitations of this method are acknowledged, strategies will be in place to mitigate these. This type of data collection approach has been used successfully with this population. An ‘episode away from home’ is defined by a single occurrence of leaving the home, counted for the previous week, which is collected by Smartphone and App from persons with dementia, and by self-report from them and/or their care partners.</p>

We will collect information from participants about the mode of transport used for each episode away from home (e.g. walk, taxi, bus), counted for the previous week, and about any concerns they had about the mode of transport used (e.g. safety). Other secondary outcome measures include wellbeing, depression, anxiety, self-efficacy and self-performance and isolation, which will be collected from dyads; as well as caregiving strain collected from carer/family member only (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At baseline, general questions related to demographics, mobility, proximity to services, usual transport used, community involvement, socioeconomic status, and the circumstances surrounding driving cessation (e.g. participant is the only driver in household, participant’s readiness to transition to retired driver), will be collected.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Pre- and post-intervention measurement tools relating to persons with dementia and family members/care partners, collected at Times 1, 2, and 3</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Person with dementia</th><th>Family Member</th><th>Measure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Lifespace; Episodes away from home</td><td>Lifespace; Episodes away from home</td><td>Lifespace metrics via Smartphone GPS data; Self-report, Life Space Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Mode/s of transport used in previous week</td><td>Mode/s of transport used in previous week</td><td>Semi-structured Interview</td></tr><tr><td>Readiness for transitioning to non-driver</td><td/><td>Assessment of Readiness for Mobility Transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Social Isolation</td><td>Social Isolation</td><td>Loneliness Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Wellbeing/Quality of life</td><td>Wellbeing/Quality of life</td><td>Personal Wellbeing Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Caregiver Strain</td><td>Caregiver Burden Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Self-efficacy - Transport and lifestyle</td><td>Caregivers Self-efficacy</td><td>Transport and Lifestyle Self Efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Depression and Anxiety symptoms</td><td>Depression and Anxiety symptoms</td><td>Geriatric Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; Geriatric Anxiety Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Individualized goal setting (and achievement of goals)</td><td>(completed together)</td><td>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>Perceptions of needs and experiences, feedback</td><td>Perceptions of needs and experiences, feedback</td><td>Semi-structured interviews with sub-sample</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

The researcher will answer any questions that potential participants may have and provide further information, and conduct the screening process. A researcher will ask questions of the caller about (as appropriate) their own or the retired/retiring driver’s age, the types of memory problems he or she is having, and their driving situation, to determine their eligibility. Participants with dementia or their family member/support person will be asked to report the individual’s diagnosis of dementia and stage of dementia, ie. participants in the mild to moderate stage dementia will be screened through self-report or proxy-report and the CDR, and will be eligible to participate. If appropriate the researcher will make an appointment for an assessor to attend the participants’ home to conduct baseline assessment. Participants will be given the option to re-consider their participation after their initial contact and before the baseline assessment, or at any time during the study. A follow-up telephone call will be made to potential participants prior to the assessment commencing, by way of reminder, to answer any further questions and confirm their participation.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Initial assessment will take place after obtaining written informed consent. Based on cluster randomisation, participants will be assigned to either the immediate intervention group, or to the wait-list control group. An assessor, who is blind to group allocations will attend in person (e.g. participants’ homes) to conduct all assessments. Following initial assessments, participants will be given a choice of home visit, telephone, or videoconference, for the next two data collection time points (ie. Times 2 and 3, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The intervention group will receive the intervention approximately two weeks after baseline assessment, and the control group will be offered to receive the intervention after Time 3 assessment. The wait-list control group will receive regular mailed brochures (ie. treatment as usual) and telephone calls throughout the wait period.</p>

That is, after participants are briefed about the study once again, they will be given the opportunity to ask questions, consider their participation and if they agree, to indicate their agreement by signing the consent form and then proceeding with baseline assessment. Participants’ continued consent and assent will be checked throughout the study. Participants who withdraw from the study will be given the opportunity to also withdraw their data to that point if they wish to.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par54">Giving up driving is a pivotal life event and universal challenge for people living with dementia and their families, and the health professionals who monitor driving with their patients with dementia. The best outcomes are for individuals to plan for and eventually cease driving, however with insufficient support programs in place, many avoid the issue until it is reaches a crises point. With increasing numbers of older adults driving in later life and increasing numbers of people living with dementia, there is an urgent need to upskill health professionals to manage the complex issues around dementia and driving cessation, and to explore the most cost-effective and timely ways to deliver support to people living with dementia. The driving cessation intervention – aimed at enhancing participants’ community mobility and wellbeing – may fill an important gap in service delivery to people living with dementia who are adjusting to life without driving.</p>
              <p id="Par55">Future research aims are to translate the driving cessation intervention for people with dementia into routine clinical practice. The process evaluation will contribute valuable information to understanding optimal processes, for example timing and number of sessions, in determining a feasible translation strategy.</p>
