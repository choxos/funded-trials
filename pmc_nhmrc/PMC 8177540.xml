                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The impact of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) on arterial intima-media thickness (IMT), a surrogate measure for cardiovascular disease, remains uncertain, in part because of the potential for non-SDB vascular risk factor interactions. In the present study, we determined predictors for common carotid (CCA) and femoral (CFA) artery IMT in an adult, sleep clinic cohort where non-SDB vascular risk factors (particularly diabetes) were eliminated or controlled.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We recruited 296 participants for polysomnography (standard SDB severity metrics) and CCA/CFA ultrasound examinations, followed by a 12 month vascular risk factor minimisation (RFM) and continuous positive pressure (CPAP) intervention for participants with a range of SDB severity (RFM Sub-Group, n = 157; apnea hyponea index [AHI]: 14.7 (7.2–33.2), median [IQR]). Univariable and multivariable linear regression models determined independent predictors for IMT. Linear mixed effects modelling determined independent predictors for IMT change across the intervention study. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Age, systolic blood pressure and waist:hip ratio were identified as non-SDB predictive factors for CCA IMT and age, weight and total cholesterol:HDL ratio for CFA IMT. No SDB severity metric emerged as an independent predictor for either CCA or CFA IMT, except in the RFM Sub-Group, where a 2-fold increase in AHI predicted a 2.4% increase in CFA IMT. Across the intervention study, CCA IMT decreased in those who lost weight, but there was no CPAP use interaction. CFA IMT, however, decreased by 12.9% (95%CI 6.8, 18.7%, p = 0.001) in those participants who both lost weight and used CPAP &gt; = 4hours/night.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>We conclude that SDB severity has little impact on CCA IMT values when non-SDB vascular risk factors are minimised or not present. This is the first study, however, to suggest a potential linkage between SDB severity and CFA IMT values.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common consequence of increased upper airway resistance during sleep [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. SDB is associated with a number of different comorbidities, including both cardio- and cerebrovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While the mechanisms underlying these associations remain poorly understood, epidemiological studies suggest a strong relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and stroke [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. People with moderate to severe OSA were at substantially increased risk of stroke in the Busselton Sleep Cohort [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], while stroke risk for men in the Sleep Heart Health Study increased by 6% for each unit increase in apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) between 5–25 events/hr [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>A number of plausible mechanisms have been proposed linking SDB and macrovascular disease, including intermittent hypoxia, intrathoracic pressure swings and sleep fragmentation [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. But despite the plausibility of a mechanistic role for SDB, the evidence is not clear. The SAVE trial failed to support a causal relationship between OSA and cardiovascular disease showing no significant reduction of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events when OSA was treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is possible, however, that more sensitive measures of cardiovascular benefit were overlooked.</p>
              <p>One such measure may be the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), which is a simple and non-invasive ultrasonographic method to evaluate subclinical cardiovascular disease and early atherosclerosis, and a predictor of future cerebral and cardiovascular events [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The potential confounding influence of known macro-vascular disease risk factors (RF) makes it difficult to clarify interactions with OSA. Further, the high prevalence of these RFs in sleep clinic cohorts means an independent effect for SDB is likely to be difficult to detect. This issue was highlighted in a recent meta-analysis of 18 studies comparing carotid IMT for individuals with and without OSA [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The authors found strong heterogeneity in study results suggesting inconsistency in adjustment for confounding factors. Moreover, in a sub-group analysis, better matching of confounding variables uncovered an increase in carotid IMT for OSA patients compared to controls, and a significant correlation between AHI and carotid IMT (r = 0.389; P&lt;0.001).</p>
              <p>While the focus of SDB research has been on associations with the carotid IMT, it has been suggested recently that the femoral artery IMT may be a more sensitive marker of cardiovascular risk [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While femoral and carotid IMT are strongly correlated with each other, the RFs associated with each differ [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has also been suggested that local haemodynamic factors may have a larger impact on the development of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery than in the femoral artery and, thus, systemic RFs may be more important for the femoral artery [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, there is appeal in exploring the relationship between SDB and femoral IMT.</p>
              <p>CPAP therapy is first line treatment for OSA, however, reported effects of CPAP on carotid IMT are inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While there are some methodological concerns about these studies, a recent meta-analysis found CPAP had no overall effect on carotid IMT in OSA patients [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but there was a decrease in carotid IMT in a sub-group of patients with more severe OSA and longer term CPAP use. It is possible that studying the femoral IMT, as a surrogate measure of vascular health, may be advantageous in exploring the effects of CPAP.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, the aims of the present study were to determine predictors for carotid and femoral IMT in a sleep clinic cohort and determine their relationships with SDB severity. In our study design, we attempted to minimise interactions with classical non-SDB vascular disease RFs by excluding individuals with diabetes. We then combined objective ultrasound measurements of IMT with gold-standard, in-laboratory, polysomnography (PSG) for assessment of SDB. The study involved a cross-sectional analysis in which statistical modelling was used to search for significant predictive variables based on improvements in estimates of explained variance. We also included a longitudinal (12-month), intervention-based sub-group study, aimed at complementing the main cross-sectional study results by testing the impact on IMT of minimising SDB using CPAP when superimposed on a background of medically supervised vascular disease RF stabilisation.</p>

                <title>Study participants</title>
                <p>We recruited 373 adults all over the age of 35 years, with no known history of carotid artery disease/surgery, all referred to a research sleep clinic between 5<sup>th</sup> September 2011 and 25<sup>th</sup> July 2016, for investigation of potential SDB and all evaluated by the same senior sleep physician (Author: KK). Participants were screened for diabetes and 42 were subsequently excluded on the basis of either a history of diabetes or a fasting blood sugar level (BSL fasting) ≥ 7 mmol/L, while 35 other participants either withdrew from the study or were excluded for other reasons (e.g. failure to attend study visits). The remaining 296 participants formed the study “Main Group”.</p>
                <p>Participants were then invited to participate in a 12-month duration RF minimisation intervention (RFM) sub-study conducted between 13<sup>th</sup> September 2011 and 6<sup>th</sup> December 2016. A feature of this sub-study was that individuals encompassing a wide range of SDB severity levels were invited to participate, with the goal of recruiting participants with a range of SDB severity for analysis purposes. Enrichment of this sub-group with individuals across the SDB severity spectrum meant that some were included in the sub-study who wouldn’t have been considered for CPAP on clinical criteria. A total of 157 participants (“RFM Sub-Group”) agreed to enter this phase of the study and committed to regular monitoring and 12 month follow-up data collection. <xref rid="pone.0252569.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> shows a flow diagram of the study design.

                <p>Sleep disordered breathing was assessed by standard polysomnography [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nasal pressure was used to measure airflow for scoring hypopneas. Pulse oximetry recorded blood oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>).

                <title>Carotid &amp; femoral ultrasound</title>
                <p>Carotid and common femoral artery B-mode ultrasounds were obtained using a SonoSite M-Turbo ultrasound system, using either a HFL38x 13–6 MHz or an L38x 10–5 MHz transducer (Fujifilm SonoSite, Inc; Bothell, WA, USA). Participants lay supine with their upper body slightly raised, neck extended and turned contralateral to the side being examined. Several longitudinal images were obtained of the common carotid artery (CCA), with the carotid bulb visible at the far left of the image and at least 20mm of the CCA intima-media layer proximal to the bulb. Similar images were obtained of the common femoral artery (CFA) with the participant supine and their leg slightly abducted, with the femoral bifurcation at the far right of the image and at least 20mm of CFA intima-media layer proximal to the bifurcation. The images were stored for later offline analysis.</p>
                <p>A single experienced sonographer assessed the images and made IMT measurements using the SonoCalc IMT software (Fujifilm Sonosite, Inc) trace methodology with at least three reference points. Measurements were made on the posterior wall of the CCA and CFA over a 10mm segment, with measurements in the CCA acquired in a 10–20 mm segment inferior to the carotid bulb. The software calculated the mean IMT. All IMT measurements were acquired three times for each location (left and right CCA, left and right CFA) and these three values were then averaged to give a single measurement for each site. Left and right values were then averaged to give overall CCA and CFA IMT values.</p>

They were assigned a CPAP machine (ResMed S9; ResMed Ltd., Bella Vista, NSW, Australia; or Respironics System One; Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA, USA) and fitted with an appropriate mask. Over the next 12-months, participants received personalised support, including monthly medical monitoring of their health and medication status, counselling to encourage continued nightly CPAP use, and regular downloads of their CPAP usage. At the conclusion of the study, repeat measures of anthropometrics, blood pressure and carotid/femoral IMT were obtained and data were analysed for CPAP compliance (hours of use).</p>

                <p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Except where stated, P&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

Both trials were conducted simultaneously, used the same methodologies, and addressed the same outcome variables, but with study cohorts focused on different degrees of sleep disordered breathing severity. However, because there was considerable overlap in the range of measured sleep disordered breathing severities between the two study cohorts they were combined post hoc into one overarching analysis.</p>

                  <title>Cross-sectional study</title>
                  <p>Group data were summarised using mean (± standard deviation) or median (interquartile range), where appropriate, for continuous variables, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Since many continuous variables were skewed, Spearman rank correlation (r) was used to quantify the pairwise associations between them. Linear regression was used to define the age relationship for both CCA and CFA IMT. Differences between the RFM Minimisation Sub-Group and those Main Group participants not included in the RFM study were tested using two-samples t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests where appropriate for continuous variables, and chi-square tests for categorical variables.</p>
                  <p>Our analysis strategy first identified non-sleep related variables predictive of IMT operating within the data set (base models) and then assessed the impact of adding individual SDB variables to the base models as described below. IMT and the continuous SDB variable values were skewed. These data were log transformed (after adding 1 to SDB variables to deal with potential zero values) to approximate Normality and to stabilise the variance prior to analysis. Model parameter estimates for these variables were back transformed and relationships reported in terms of relative (rather than absolute) change on the original scale of measurement. The models based on relative change relationships were considered biologically plausible and more closely adhered to underlying statistical assumptions. Diagnostic residual plots (including residuals versus fitted values and Normal probability plots of the residuals) were used to check the adequacy of the fitted models.</p>
                  <p>Backward stepwise multiple linear regression (variables removed at p&gt;0.1) was used to identify independent non-sleep variable predictors from amongst candidate variables that were identified in two ways: 1) based on published models for IMT [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; and 2) demonstrated significant (p&lt;0.05) univariable associations with IMT within the cross-sectional study data. In addition, a ‘study group’ factor (‘included’ in RFM Sub-Group versus ‘not included’) was included to determine whether the same set of non-sleep variables were operating in the RFM sub-group. Collinear variables were identified by collinearity tests–variance inflation factor (VIF&gt;10), condition index (&gt;30) and variance proportion (&gt;0.5)–and were removed based on weaker univariate associations with the dependent variable. Identified candidate variables were then entered into the backward stepwise regression and a base model established for each dependent variable (ln(CCA IMT) or ln(CFA IMT) base model). As the study group factor was not significant in these models, the same base models were used for analysis of both the Main Group and RFM Sub-Group.</p>
                  <p>SDB variables, AHI category and severe/non-severe OSA) were added to the base models individually to assess the effect of each SDB variable after adjusting for the base model. These models were also checked for collinearity, as above. The base-model-adjusted parameter estimate and its standard error (SE) are presented for each SDB variable along with the incremental change (SBD model-Base Model) in R<sup>2</sup> (ΔR<sup>2</sup>) to determine whether the addition of the SDB variable to the base model improved overall model performance. An interaction term [SDB variable x study group] was added to test whether the base-model-adjusted SDB effect differed between those included in the RFM Sub-Group and those not included. If a significant SDB variable x study group] interaction was detected, the base-model-adjusted SDB parameter was also estimated in only the RFM Sub-Group.</p>

                  <p>Paired t tests were used to test for within participant change in log transformed IMT values over 12 months and results expressed as percentage change in IMT from baseline with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). For each variable in the cross-sectional study base models, the within participant change over 12 months was calculated as: Δvariable = (variable<sub>12month</sub>−variable<sub>baseline</sub>). Spearman rank correlation was used to quantify the association between the change in ln(IMT) and each Δvariable.</p>
                  <p>Linear mixed effects (LME) models were used to examine the effect of CPAP use on ln(IMT) values over the 12 month RFM study, either as a continuous variable (average hours/day) or as a dichotomous variable (&lt;4hrs/day vs &gt; = 4hrs/day). In these models, subject was used as the group identifier. The ‘Visit’ (1 = baseline, 2 = 12 months) variable was fitted as both a random effect with unstructured covariance matrix and as a fixed effect. The covariates from the relevant base model were added, along with CPAP use and its interaction with Visit, as fixed effects. A significant (CPAPxVisit) interaction term was interpreted as evidence that CPAP use influenced the within participant change in ln(IMT) from baseline to 12 months. Diagnostic plots were used to assess the adequacy of the fitted models. They included scatter plots of standardized residuals by fitted values and Normal probablity plots of residuals and of estimated random effects to check the normality assumption for the within-subject errors and for the random effects.</p>

                  <p>The following variables were entered into a backward stepwise multiple linear regression model of log transformed CCA IMT values: age, BMI, gender, ethnicity, systolic blood pressure, smoking history (combined current and/or past), cholesterol medication, hypertension medication, neck circumference, waist:hip ratio, total cholesterol:HDL ratio, fasting blood sugar level and study group. The final model for ln(CCA IMT) (<xref rid="pone.0252569.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4A</xref>) explained 27% of the variance. Diagnostic plots of the residuals showed good agreement with error assumptions underlying the model. Age was the most significant predictor demonstrating a 9.3% (95%CI 7.0–11.7%, p&lt;0.001) increase in CCA IMT per decade of age. Other significant predictors were systolic BP predicting 0.20% (95%CI 0.04–0.40%, p = 0.016) increase per mmHg and waist:hip ratio predicting 27% (95%CI 1.2–59%, p = 0.040) increase in CCA IMT per au. Study group was not a significant predictor and was excluded prior to the final model.</p>

The final model (<xref rid="pone.0252569.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4B</xref>) explained 21% of the variance. Diagnostic plots of the residuals showed good agreement with error assumptions underlying the model. Age was the most significant predictor demonstrating a 6.9% (95%CI 4.6–9.3%, p&lt;0.001) increase in CFA IMT per decade of age. Other significant predictors were weight, predicting 0.30% (95%CI 0.10–0.50%, p&lt;0.001) increase in CFA IMT per kg, and total cholesterol:HDL ratio predicting 1.9% (95%CI 0.14–3.7%, p = 0.037) increase per au. Study group was not a significant predictor and was excluded prior to the final model.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In a non-diabetic, sleep clinic cohort, aged &gt;35 yrs, carotid and femoral artery IMT values were positively associated with the participant’s age. Statistical models incorporating a range of non-sleep and SDB variables explained at most 27% of the variance in CCA IMT and 21% of the variance in CFA IMT, leaving the majority of the between individual differences unexplained. Non-sleep related predictive factors for CCA and CFA IMT were broadly in alignment with those identified by large population studies [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Smoking history, however, did not emerge as a signfiicant predictive factor for CCA and CFA IMT, this is probably because there were very few current (most at risk) smokers (n = 11) in the cohort.</p>
              <p>We did not identify any impacts of SDB severity on CCA IMT values. However, in a sub-group with a wide range of SDB severity, RDI and AHI emerged as predictive variables for CFA IMT: a 2-fold increase in RDI predicting a 4.0% increase in CFA IMT, and a 2-fold increase in AHI predicting a 2.4% increase.</p>
              <p>When sub-group individuals were stabilised on medical therapy, monitored and given CPAP for 12 months, CCA IMT increased within participant by a nonsignificant 0.8% in accordance with age. In contrast, CFA IMT decreased within participant by on average 3.5%. This reduction was related to both weight loss and CPAP use with those who lost weight and also used CPAP &gt; = 4hrs/day demonstrating a reduction in CFA IMT from baseline.</p>

                <title>Study cohort characteristics</title>
                <p>In interpreting the results of the present study, it is important to understand the characteristics of the study cohort. This is not a randomised community-recruited population-based study. Rather, we targeted a specific Main Group (i.e. patients referred to a sleep clinic for assessment of SDB) and then screened for and eliminated diabetes as a RF. Consequently, our study group is also not a randomised sleep clinic population sample. The aim was to test for associations between specific SDB metrics and specific macro-vascular characteristics (IMT) in an environment where the influence of known cardio-vascular disease RFs was minimised. The rationale for this approach assumed that SDB influences were likely to be small compared with well-known systemic RFs, such as diabetes and smoking, and therefore, would be more likely to be detected in the absence of these major confounders. A number of previously published studies that have attempted to quantify associations between carotid IMT and SDB have highlighted this limitation [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
                <p>In the Main Group not only was diabetes eliminated but ~40% of participants were on current treatment for hypertension and/or hypercholesterolaemia. Blood lipid and sugar levels were centred on normal levels for the group, but with a range of individual values (See S1C Table in <xref rid="pone.0252569.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Framingham Cardiovascular Risk levels were relatively evenly distributed between low and intermediate/high, tended to be higher in males, and were similar to those reported for population studies across this age range [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Sleep disordered breathing varied across the severity spectrum but was skewed to lower values, with only ~40% being determined to have moderate/severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15 events/hr).</p>
                <p>It is also important to understand the nature of the RFM Sub-Group, in which an association between SDB and femoral artery IMT was detected. The RFM Sub-Group had a similar Framingham Cardiovascular Risk profile to the Main Group, but a greater proportion were male, and so had corresponding changes in body size measures (taller, weighed more, larger neck circumference). Overall SDB was more severe in the RFM Sub-Group with ~51% considered to have moderate/severe OSA. Thus, the OSA distribution of the Main Group skewed towards normal-mild, while the RFM Sub-Group, by design, had a more even distribution.</p>

                <title>CCA IMT</title>
                <p>CCA IMT is an established marker for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It has strong associations with established cardiovascular RFs including age, gender, BMI, lipid profile, diabetes, smoking and ethnicity [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and these RFs have been variably used in regression modelling to predict CCA IMT in healthy and cardiovascular disease populations [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. OSA has been found to be independently associated with CCA IMT [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] in sleep clinic cohorts, with a recent meta-analysis finding a moderate correlation (r = 0.389) between AHI and CCA IMT [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, differences in the degree of heterogeneity, small sample sizes, as well as differences in screening procedures and analysis techniques, create a degree of uncertainty as to the generalisability of these results.</p>
                <p>Values for CCA IMT in the present study were positively associated with age and fell in the reported population normal range for age [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Consequently, our non-diabetic sleep clinic-recruited cohort values for CCA IMT do not appear to vary systematically from what would be expected for a wider community age-matched group. Of the range of potential predictive variables tested in our multiple linear regression base models, age was the strongest independent predictor for ln(CCA IMT) along with minor contributions from systolic blood pressure and a body size measure (waist-hip ratio). This model, however, only explained ~27% of the total variance, leaving the majority of the difference between individual subject values unexplained.</p>
                <p>When SDB variables were added to our base models there was either no or minimal improvement in the amount of variance explained and no SDB variable emerged as a significant independent predictor. Consequently, in this group, with a range of cardiovascular risk and where the distribution of SDB severity was skewed to lower values, we could not detect a role in predicting CCA IMT values for any SDB severity metric. This result also applied to the RFM Sub-Group with its greater relative proportion of more severe SDB. Interestingly, CCA IMT demonstrated a nonsignificant 0.8% overall mean increase within the Sub Group during the 12 month intervention in keeping with the predicted 0.9% age effect detected in the Main Group base model (see <xref rid="pone.0252569.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4A</xref>). Linear mixed effects models of ln(CCA IMT) adjusted for the base model variables detected a significant difference between the 12 month 3.8% mean reduction in CCA IMT observed in those who lost weight compared to the 3.3% mean increase in those who gained weight. No significant association with CPAP use was seen.</p>
                <p>The rank correlations between CCA IMT and SDB variables observed in the cross-sectional study are consistent with reports in the literature, but our rank correlation with AHI is lower than that reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We were unable to detect an independent association between SDB and ln(CCA IMT) using multiple regression analysis. This finding contrasts with reports in the literature of a significant independent association between CCA IMT and AHI values [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There were, however, several key differences between these studies and ours. Suzuki et al. [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] studied a sleep clinic cohort, without excluding diabetes, with more severe SDB and higher IMT values, while Drager et al. [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] studied a small, highly selected group, excluding most other RFs, including age. The low IMT values in the present study–CCA IMT median (IQR): 0.56 (0.51–0.64) mm, i.e. very few IMT’s in the abnormal range–may have contributed to the weaker association seen with AHI compared to others. This may in turn have influenced our ability to find an independent association in multivariable models. Our results, however, were broadly in alignment with Kim et al. [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] who studied a similarly sized group with medically controlled RFs. Their findings of no significant difference in CCA IMT between participants with OSA and controls and no effect of CPAP on CCA IMT after 4 months are consistent with the present study. By excluding diabetes and controlling other RFs we may have limited the possibility for interactions between SDB and these other RFs that have previously been reported to have additive effects on IMT [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>

                <title>CFA IMT</title>
                <p>CFA IMT has been studied much less than CCA IMT, but similar associations with cardiovascular RFs have been found [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that CFA IMT may actually be a stronger predictor of coronary artery disease [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and a more sensitive measure of overall cardiovascular risk [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To date, no other studies have examined relationships between SDB and CFA IMT.</p>
                <p>Values for CFA IMT in the present study were positively associated with age, but not as strongly as for CCA IMT, and were broadly aligned with the limited population normal range for age available in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and did not differ between the Main and RFM Sub-Groups (<xref rid="pone.0252569.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In contrast to CCA IMT, CFA IMT demonstrated rank correlations of approximately 0.3 with body size metrics, especially weight and neck circumference, and weaker positive associations with systolic blood pressure and all SDB variables, except those for hypoxia (<xref rid="pone.0252569.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These findings suggest that age and body size are the main univariable associative factors for CFA IMT operating in this data set, and, in comparison, the rank correlations with SDB variables are weaker and less certain.</p>
                <p>In the Main Group multiple linear regression analysis, age and weight were identified as the strongest independent predictors for ln(CFA IMT), with total cholesterol:HDL ratio also emerging as significant predictor. However, the model itself only explained 21% of the total variance leaving the majority of the variance unexplained. When SDB variables were added to the base model there was either no or minimal improvement in the amount of variance explained and no SDB variable emerged as a significant independent predictor. Consequently, in this group, with a range of cardiovascular risk and where the distribution of SDB severity was skewed to lower values, we could not detect a role for any SDB severity metric in predicting CFA IMT values.</p>
                <p>There were, however, significant interactions between several SDB variables and study group, i.e. the effect of SDB variables on ln(CFA IMT) adjusted for the base model differed between those included in the RFM Sub-Group and those not included. Both ln(AHI) and ln(RDI) emerged as significant independent predictors of ln(CFA IMT), explaining an additional 3–4% of the variance when added to the base model in the RFM Sub-Group. This differs from the Main Group outcome and suggests a potential small role for SDB severity as a predictor of CFA IMT in a Sub-Group enriched with more severe SDB.</p>
                <p>There are no previous studies examining CFA IMT in OSA. There are, however, a number of publications that support differing biology and predictors [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for CFA versus CCA IMT. In the present study different predictors were identified in the Main Group and RFM Sub-Group. Given that the RFM Sub-Group contained a greater proportion of males with more severe SDB, one potential interpretation is that this finding reflects more systemic impacts of SDB operating in the RFM Sub-Group. We speculate that the femoral vascular bed may be more sensitive than the carotid vasculature to the cardiovascular stressors seen during sleeping with OSA (intermittent hypoxia and increased nocturnal sympathetic activity).</p>
                <p>CFA IMT decreased significantly within participants by 3.5% (95%CI 0.8, 6.2%, p = 0.013) with 12 months of RFM intervention. Considering that the CFA IMT-age relationship for this group predicted a 0.7% increase, the observed decrease is additional to this expected increase. Linear mixed effects modelling of ln(CFA IMT) adjusted for the base model variables detected a significant association between the 12 month change observed in ln(CFA IMT) and the joint effects of CPAP use and within patient weight change: those who lost weight and also used CPAP &gt; = 4hrs/day reduced CFA IMT from baseline compared to no significant change in those who gained weight or used CPAP &lt;4hours/day. These findings suggest that treatment of SDB with CPAP, when combined with weight loss and medical stabilisation of vascular RF, may help contribute to reducing CFA IMT thickening, at least over the first year post diagnosis. Further studies will be require to determine if this effect is maintained over longer time frames.</p>

                <title>Strengths &amp; limitations</title>
                <p>This study has a number of strengths and limitations. The small study size limits statistical power to detect relatively small changes in IMT against a background of remaining more influential RFs. The established non-SDB RFs were only able to explain 20–27% of the variance in IMT for the group. This is comparable with the results of larger population studies that have found similar RFs explaining 29% of the variance in CCA IMT [<xref rid="pone.0252569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252569.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The fact that we were only able to detect small independent associations between SDB variables and CFA IMT in our OSA-enriched RFM Sub-Group suggests that detecting such associations in an overall sleep clinic population would require larger numbers. However, the Main Group size compares favourably with other studies examining associations between SDB and IMT and the RFM Sub-Group is one of the largest studies, with a long follow-up period, examining the association between changes in IMT and RFM intervention (including CPAP treatment).</p>
                <p>The composition of the study group: 1) eliminated a major RF, diabetes; 2) controlled for some, i.e. treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia; and 3) allowed a range of other RFs, e.g. age and body size. This was an attempt to avoid trying to find a potentially small SDB effect in the presence of more influential confounders typical of larger groups, while simultaneously avoiding very small study groups produced by eliminating all known RFs. Our efforts may, however, have succeeded in dampening interaction effects between classic RFs and SDB by monitoring and controlling them carefully. This may have resulted in IMT values for the study group that essentially fell within the normal range predicted from larger population studies. This increased the difficulty to detecting independent associations with SDB and was also an important limitation for the RF Minimisation Intervention. A “floor effect” may have been in play, whereby IMT levels could not be further reduced. Nevertheless, we were able to detect a significant overall decrease in CFA IMT across the intervention period, while CCA IMT tended to increase in line with the 1-year increase in age.</p>
                <p>Examination of the femoral artery was an important strength of the study. The stronger associations found between SDB and CFA versus CCA IMT suggest that the CFA IMT may be a better marker of cardiovascular disease than the CCA IMT. Our multivariable models support a role for SDB as a small, but significant, independent predictor of CFA IMT. Given the emerging evidence regarding the differences in biology between the carotid and femoral arteries, the CFA IMT may also be a useful marker of SDB-associated cardiovascular risk.</p>

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>Overall findings from the cross-sectional study identified classic vascular RFs for IMT. Although we found univariable associations for metrics of SDB severity, we did not identify any independent associations in the Main Group. In the more severely SDB affected RF Minimisation Sub-Group, both AHI and RDI emerged as independent predictors of CFA IMT. A 12-month RF Minimisation Intervention reduced CFA IMT by 12.6% in those who both lost weight and used CPAP &gt; = 4hours/day.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In this study of non-diabetic patients presenting to a sleep clinic, total variance in carotid and femoral artery IMT was only modestly explained by a combination of anthropometric characteristics (predominantly age) and known clinical RFs. There was no detectable contribution from SDB metrics, except for a small contribution to CFA IMT variance attributable to measures of SDB severity (AHI/RDI). Intervening with 12 months of RF minimisation including CPAP did not alter CCA IMT but reduced CFA IMT specifically in those who both lost weight and used CPAP &gt; = 4hours/day.</p>
              <p>We conclude that once classical vascular disease RFs are excluded or controlled, SDB may play a minor role in increasing risk for femoral, but not carotid, artery IMT values in sleep clinic patients. This effect, however, is minimal when compared with the influence of known cardiovascular RFs and is even less substantial when compared with the levels of unexplained variance revealed by our modelling. However, this is the first study to suggest a potential linkage between femoral artery IMT levels and SDB severity.</p>

              <p>Predictors for carotid and femoral artery intima-media thickness in a non-diabetic sleep clinic cohort</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Amis,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>I would like to sincerely apologise for the delay you have incurred with your submission. It has been exceptionally difficult to secure reviewers to evaluate your study. We have now received three completed reviews; their comments are available below. Reviewer#1 and #3 have raised concerns about the statistical analysis in this study that need to be addressed in a revision.</p>
              <p>Please revise the manuscript to address all the reviewer's comments in a point-by-point response in order to ensure it is meeting the journal's publication criteria. Please note that the revised manuscript will need to undergo further review, we thus cannot at this point anticipate the outcome of the evaluation process.</p>

              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript addresses an interesting topic. The collected data contain several features to be analysed. The research questions are appropriate and the employed statistical methods generally sound. Some comments follow.</p>
              <p>1. Data are not fully available without restrictions. This is not in line with the journal's guidelines. More importantly, the reviewer does not have the chance to fully check the correctness of the methods. Please, upload the data and the code used to obtain the results.</p>
              <p>2. Statistical tests and models are applied without a full investigation of the assumptions which must be fulfilled to ensure the reliability of the data. This is of course true for the test on linear correlations, but even more important when the regression model is employed. The authors must provide evidence that the Gauss-Markov assumptions are fulfilled. The analysis of residuals must be included.</p>
              <p>3. The main outcome is skewed. A log transformation is applied. However, this is not justified and lead to a different empirical model, where the outcome has a different shape (i.e. a different variability). I am wondering why a regression model with skewed errors is overlooked. I see that "usually people act this way", but this does not mean that it is correct.</p>
              <p>4. The performed longitudinal analysis is quite obscure to me. Do you have missing values? How do you account for repeated measurements and, accordingly, to dependence across obsevartions belonging to the same unit? You mention the linear mixed model, which is sound. Do you assumed Gaussian random effects? Is it a reasonable assumption for the data at hand? Wha about random coefficients? Again, please, check model's assumptions.</p>
              <p>a. The R^2 are accompanied by a p-value. What does it refer to? Are you really comparing the intercept-only model with a model where the covariates are significant, and does obviuously improve the fit? In general, model fitting is rather poor, so there is a lot of unexplained heterogeneity.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting article investigating the relationship between IMT of CCA/CFA and polysomnographic parameters. The results showed no significant association between severity of sleep apnea and carotid IMT. However, small association was found between femoral IMT and AHI/RDI. Otherwise, CPAP therapy for 12 months did not alter carotid IMT but reduced femoral IMT that was correlated with weight change instead of CPAP use.</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>1.Some important variables such as mini-O2 and snoring can be associated with carotid IMT and need to be included for analyses.</p>
              <p>2.The change of IMT in one year period could be very tiny. Thus persistent follow-up is necessary to clarify the long-term effect. Regarding CPAP outcome in terms of IMT, no progression is another explanation in comparison to progression of IMT in non-treatment group patients. This can be put into discussion or do subgroup analysis to clarify the CPAP effect.</p>
              <p>3.The clinical meaning and significance of femoral IMT in contribution to OSA need discussion.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Review of the manuscript “Predictors for carotid and femoral artery intima-media thickness in a non diabetic sleep clinic cohort”</p>
              <p>The study is interesting, however, there are some main concerns to be evaluated. Changing several variables in the 12-month sub-study can leave the analyzes confusing. BMI and OSA severity are collinear variables. Even when conducting collinearity tests, with a relatively small number of patients, we may have erroneous conclusions. Another fundamental point is the inclusion of smokers in this study. Smoking increases cardiovascular risk by 20 x, so it is difficult to analyze risk factors of such different importance in a study of approx. 200 participants. Please insert more information about smoking in the text</p>
              <p>Authors must inform cpap adherence data, which is essential for data interpretation. The SAVE Study was cited, but the main criticism of the study is precisely the low adherence to cpap. Therefore, a reduction in cardiovascular risk with cpap cannot be assessed without this analysis. The adherence group (&gt; 4 h of daily use) vs the non-adherence group (&lt;4 h of daily use) should be evaluated</p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>Describe whether fixed or automatic cpap was used. Describe the AIH after titration</p>

              <p>Response to reviewers (as per uploaded response file)</p>
              <p>RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: “The manuscript addresses an interesting topic. The collected data contain several features to be analysed. The research questions are appropriate and the employed statistical methods generally sound. Some comments follow.”</p>
              <p>1.1 Reviewer Question: “Data are not fully available without restrictions. This is not in line with the journal's guidelines. More importantly, the reviewer does not have the chance to fully check the correctness of the methods. Please, upload the data and the code used to obtain the results”.</p>
              <p>Response: We have uploaded our data set as “Supplemental Material”.</p>
              <p>1.2. Reviewer Question: “Statistical tests and models are applied without a full investigation of the assumptions which must be fulfilled to ensure the reliability of the data. This is of course true for the test on linear correlations, but even more important when the regression model is employed. The authors must provide evidence that the Gauss-Markov assumptions are fulfilled. The analysis of residuals must be included”.</p>
              <p>Response: More details have been added to the Methods and Statistical Analysis section (see Revised Manuscript Pages 11-13, Lines 206-266). In particular it is noted there (see Revised Manuscript Page 11, Lines 208-9) and in the Results sections (see Revised Manuscript Table 3) that all reported correlations between continuous variables are Spearman rank correlations (not Pearson correlations which are sensitive to departures from normality). It is also now noted that (1) ‘Diagnostic residual plots (including residuals versus fitted values and Normal probability plots of the residuals) were used to check the adequacy of the fitted models’ in the multiple linear regression analyses and (2) for the linear mixed effects models ‘Diagnostic plots were used to assess the adequacy of the fitted models. They included scatter plots of standardized residuals by fitted values and Normal probablity plots of residuals and of estimated random effects to check the normality assumption for the within-subject errors and for the random effects.’</p>
              <p>1.3. Reviewer Question: “The main outcome is skewed. A log transformation is applied. However, this is not justified and lead to a different empirical model, where the outcome has a different shape (i.e. a different variability). I am wondering why a regression model with skewed errors is overlooked. I see that "usually people act this way", but this does not mean that it is correct”.</p>
              <p>Response: The Statistical Analysis section (see Revised Manuscript Page 11, Lines 216-218) now notes that the IMT and continuous SDB variables were skewed and were log transformed to approximate Normality and to stabilise the variance prior to analysis. Model parameter estimates for these variables were back transformed and relationships are now reported in terms of relative (rather than absolute) change on the original scale of measurement. The Figure 2 scatterplots of CCA IMT and CFA IMT versus age (see Revised Manuscript Figure 2) now show correct predicted values and 95% confidence bands for the IMT-age relationship based on the model for ln (IMT).</p>
              <p>The linear regression models of ln (IMT) more closely adhered to underlying statistical assumptions when diagnostic plots of residuals for models of ln (IMT) were compared with those for IMT (see plots below). We preferred the classical linear regression models for ln (IMT) and believe that these models based on relative change relationships are biologically plausible and easily interpreted by clinicians. Many diagnostic plots were considered and, therefore, we have not included them in the manuscript.</p>

              <p>1.4. Reviewer Question: “The performed longitudinal analysis is quite obscure to me. Do you have missing values? How do you account for repeated measurements and, accordingly, to dependence across observations belonging to the same unit? You mention the linear mixed model, which is sound. Do you assume Gaussian random effects? Is it a reasonable assumption for the data at hand? What about random coefficients? Again, please, check model's assumptions.”</p>
              <p>Response: Data for the longitudinal analysis were collected at only 2 time points, baseline (Visit 1), and 12 months (Visit 2). Patients in the RFM Sub-Group were included in the linear mixed effects model analyses only if they had CCA IMT values recorded at both times (n=137). Two of these patients did not have CFA IMT recorded at 12 months. The only other variables considered in the LME models which had missing data were Average CPAP use during the 12 month intervention (missing for 6/137 patients) and weight (not recorded at 12 months for 3/137 patients, one of whom was also missing CPAP).</p>
              <p>As part of the response to this particular reviewer question our statistician has now revisted and extended the LME model analysis using IBM SPSS software (see also Reviewer Question 3.3 re CPAP compliance analysis). In these models of the log transformed IMT values, subject was used as the group identifier. The ‘Visit’ (1=baseline, 2=12 months) variable was fitted as both a random effect with unstructured covariance matrix and as a fixed effect. The covariates from the relevant base model were added along with average CPAP use and its interaction with Visit as fixed effects. A significant (CPAPxVisit) interaction term was interpreted as evidence that CPAP use influenced the within participant change in CFA ln(IMT) from baseline to 12 months. These details are now given in the Statistical Analysis section (see Revised Manuscript Page 13, Lines 255-266) along with mention of diagnostic plots used to check model assumptions as explained in 1.2 and 1.3 above.</p>
              <p>These results are reported and discussed (see Revised Manuscript Pages 24-25, Lines 405-426; Page 32, Lines 566-574) while Figure 3 illustrates these findings. </p>
              <p>1.5 Reviewer Question: “The R^2 are accompanied by a p-value. What does it refer to? Are you really comparing the intercept-only model with a model where the covariates are significant, and does obviuously improve the fit? In general, model fitting is rather poor, so there is a lot of unexplained heterogeneity.”</p>
              <p>Response: The p-values accompanying R^2 values have been removed from Table 4, and supplementary Table S4. We agree that there is a lot of unexplained heterogeneity in our data set. Consequently, the relationships between IMT and both base and SDB variables, as detected in our statistical models, only partly explain (at most 21-27%) the overall IMT variance present in this relatively small cohort. We point this out in the Discussion (see Revised Manuscript Pages 27, 29 and 32).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: “This is an interesting article investigating the relationship between IMT of CCA/CFA and polysomnographic parameters. The results showed no significant association between severity of sleep apnea and carotid IMT. However, small association was found between femoral IMT and AHI/RDI. Otherwise, CPAP therapy for 12 months did not alter carotid IMT but reduced femoral IMT that was correlated with weight change instead of CPAP use.”</p>
              <p>2.1. Reviewer Question: “Some important variables such as mini-O2 and snoring can be associated with carotid IMT and need to be included for analyses.”</p>
              <p>Response: We have included analyses for minimum O2 saturation for both the Main and RFM sub group (see Revised Manuscript Tables 1, 2, 3 and 5 and Supplemental Tables S3, 5 and S6). Snoring metrics were available for the RFM sub group only (see Revised Manuscript Table 2).</p>
              <p>Neither of these variables were significant predictors for CCA or CFA IMT (see Revised Manuscript Table 5 and Supplemental Tables S6).</p>
              <p>2.2 Reviewer Question: “The change of IMT in one year period could be very tiny. Thus persistent follow-up is necessary to clarify the long-term effect. Regarding CPAP outcome in terms of IMT, no progression is another explanation in comparison to progression of IMT in non-treatment group patients. This can be put into discussion or do subgroup analysis to clarify the CPAP effect.”</p>
              <p>Response: As suggested we have done a sub-group analysis to clarify any CPAP effect. No progression for CCA IMT depended on whether the patient gained or lost weight across the 12 month RFM period (see Revised Manuscript Figure 3A). Consequently, the no progression for CCA IMT found the RFM sub group as a whole, is actually a reflection of reduced values for subjects with weight loss and increased values for those with weight gain. There was no interaction with CPAP use.</p>
              <p>CFA IMT, however, decreased for the RFM sub-group across the 12 month intervention associated with a joint effect of weight loss and CPAP use (see Revised Manuscript Figure 3B). </p>
              <p>2.3.Reviewer Question: “The clinical meaning and significance of femoral IMT in contribution to OSA need discussion.”</p>
              <p>Response: This is the first time this finding has been reported as an observational finding. The clinical significance is unknown and is not informed by our study. We note that there are literature reports suggesting a closer relationship between CFA IMT and systemic cardiovascular health metrics than has been reported for CCA IMT where hemodynamic factors may play a bigger role (see Revised Manuscript Page 5, Lines 80-84.). Whether the linkage between CFA IMT and sleep disordered breathing severity, as detected in our study, represents a more “systemic” pathophysiological interaction remains speculative.</p>
              <p>We have expanded our discussion of potential links between SDB and CFA IMT on Page 31, Lines 560-562 of the Revised Manuscript.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: “Review of the manuscript “Predictors for carotid and femoral artery intima-media thickness in a non diabetic sleep clinic cohort”</p>
              <p>3.1 Reviewer Question: “The study is interesting, however, there are some main concerns to be evaluated. Changing several variables in the 12-month sub-study can leave the analyzes confusing. BMI and OSA severity are collinear variables. Even when conducting collinearity tests, with a relatively small number of patients, we may have erroneous conclusions. “</p>
              <p>Response: We acknowledge the limitations of our relatively small sample size (see Revised Manuscript Page 32, Lines 576-586) but our RFM sub-group study is one of the larger and longer follow up studies reported. We acknowledge the potential for interactions across the 12 month intervention and this was the reasoning behind using linear mixed effects modelling to analyse the data. Indeed, this approach did reveal an interaction between weight loss and CPAP compliance for change in CFA IMT.</p>
              <p>3.2 Reviewer Question: “Another fundamental point is the inclusion of smokers in this study Smoking increases cardiovascular risk by 20 x, so it is difficult to analyze risk factors of such different importance in a study of approx. 200 participants. Please insert more information about smoking in the text.”</p>
              <p>Response: We included smoking as a risk factor on the basis of the participant reporting current smoking or having ever smoked or were currently smoking versus having never smoked. We thus combined current smokers and past smokers into one group. We have clarified our smoking classification in the Revised Manuscript on Page 8, Line 141). We used this approach because we had insufficient current smokers (n=11) to analyse separately (114 past smokers, 166 non-smokers, 5 missing data). Since past smoking history (which also may have been minimal and years ago) is not as strong a cardiovascular risk factor compared with current smoking, we suspect that we did not identify smoking history as a predictor of CCA or CFA IMT because there were very few (n=11) current smokers in our (relatively small) cohort. This point has been noted in the Discussion (see Revised Manuscript Page 26, Lines 433-435).</p>
              <p>3.3 Reviewer Question : “Authors must inform cpap adherence data, which is essential for data interpretation. The SAVE Study was cited, but the main criticism of the study is precisely the low adherence to cpap. Therefore, a reduction in cardiovascular risk with cpap cannot be assessed without this analysis. The adherence group (&gt; 4 h of daily use) vs the non-adherence group (&lt;4 h of daily use) should be evaluated”.</p>
              <p>Response: In response to the reviewer’s comment suggesting reanalysing the data for CPAP compliance of &gt; 4 hr daily versus &lt; 4 hr daily, we have now specifically incorporated this factor into the linear mixed effects modelling for the RFM sub group. There were no effects on CCA IMT over the 12 month intervention, but we can report a 12.9% (95%CI 6.8, 18.7%, p=0.001) reduction in CFA IMT from baseline in those who both lost weight and used CPAP &gt;=4hours/day, but not in those who gained/maintained weight or used CPAP &lt;4hours/day ( see Revised Manuscript Figure 3). Thus, using CPAP for &gt;4 hours daily was associated with a decrease in CFA IMT, but only those in participants who also lost weight across the 12 month intervention. This finding is discussed in the Revised Manucript on Page 32, Lines 566-574.</p>
              <p>3.4 Reviewer Question: “Describe whether fixed or automatic cpap was used. Describe the AIH after titration.”</p>
              <p>Response: CPAP was fixed. For the RFM sub group (n=137) the mean AHI value (± SD) after titration was 1.7 ± 2.1 events/hr. We have now reported these data in the revised manuscript (see Revised Manuscript Page 24, Line 392).</p>
