                <p id="Par1">This study examined the sustained and moderating effects of a behavioural sleep intervention for autistic children in a randomised controlled trial. Autistic children (5–13 years) with sleep problems were randomised to the Sleeping Sound intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU). At 12-month follow-up (<italic>n</italic> = 150), caregivers of children in the Sleeping Sound group reported greater reduction in child sleep problems compared to TAU (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, effect size: − 0.4). The long-term benefits of the intervention were greater for children taking sleep medication, children of parents who were not experiencing psychological distress, and children with greater autism severity. The Sleeping Sound intervention demonstrated sustained improvements in child sleep. Identified moderators may inform treatment by indicating which subgroups may benefit from further support.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Approximately 50–80% of autistic children experience sleep disturbance (Singh &amp; Zimmerman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>), involving a range of problems which often occur concurrently (Carnett et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>). Disordered sleep has been associated with higher levels of autistic symptoms and daytime behaviour problems in autistic children (Veatch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>), and increased levels of stress and poorer mental health for parents (Martin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>). Empirical research evaluating the efficacy and durability of sleep interventions is therefore of great importance given the possible far-reaching benefits.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Evidence-based clinical guidelines recommend behavioural interventions as the first-line treatment for sleep problems in autism (National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>; Williams Buckley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>). While there is promising meta-analytic evidence to support the short-term efficacy (ranging between 2 weeks and 2 months) of behavioural sleep interventions within this population (Keogh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>; Phillips et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>), there is a dearth of literature examining whether benefits are sustained over time. As highlighted by Schreibman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2000</xref>), an intervention that fails to demonstrate sustainability of treatment effects should not be considered optimally effective. The maintenance of treatment gains following sleep interventions is of critical importance given the fundamental role that sleep plays in human functioning, particularly for autistic children whose sleep disturbances are persistent and less likely to resolve with age (Hodge et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>; Humphreys et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par4">Nonetheless, the few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural sleep interventions in autism have conducted follow-ups over very short periods, ranging from 2 weeks to 2 months post-randomisation (Adkins et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2012</xref>; Johnson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>; Malow et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>). Only three studies (Durand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>; van Deurs et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>; Weiskop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>) have evaluated outcomes of behavioural sleep interventions for autistic children at 12-months or longer post-intervention. While each study reported sustained improvements in children’s sleep outcomes, findings are limited by the small sample sizes (<italic>n</italic> ≤ 3), single case designs, and lack of evaluation of secondary child/parent outcomes. The long-term benefits of behaviourally based sleep interventions therefore remain uncertain, particularly given evidence from adult studies suggesting that effects may diminish over time.</p>
              <p id="Par5">A recent meta-analysis of 29 RCTs examined the long-term effects of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in adults compared to non-active control groups (van der Zweerde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2019</xref>). Findings indicated that although the CBT-I group outperformed the control groups at 12-month follow-up, effect sizes steadily decreased over time (<italic>g</italic> = 0.64 at 3-month, 0.40 at 6-month, 0.25 at 12-month follow-up). In the absence of these data within the autism field, clinicians managing sleep problems cannot make evidence-informed decisions regarding the level of further assessment and support required for autistic children. The paucity of follow-up sleep studies and subsequent clinical implications highlight the need for longer-term evaluations of behavioural sleep interventions for autism.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Sleeping Sound is a brief behavioural sleep intervention that provides tailored sleep strategies to families across two face-to-face consultations. The efficacy of Sleeping Sound was initially demonstrated in a large RCT of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<italic>n</italic> = 244) (Hiscock et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>), with benefits found up to 12 months later (Sciberras et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>). Compared to TAU controls, children with ADHD who received the intervention showed greater improvements in sleep problems, ADHD severity, quality of life, daily functioning, and behaviour at 12 months post-randomisation. A recent RCT involving 245 autistic children aged 5–13 years has also confirmed the benefits of Sleeping Sound (Papadopoulos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>). Children receiving the intervention showed a reduction in sleep problems at 3 (moderate-to-large effect size; − 0.7) and 6 months (small-to-moderate effect size; − 0.4) post-randomisation compared with TAU controls. The intervention was also associated with small to moderate improvements in secondary child (emotional behavioural disturbances, internalising behaviour, and quality of life) and parent/caregiver (parenting stress, mental health, and quality of life) outcomes up to 6 months post-randomisation; however, these effects became non-significant when controlling for multiple comparisons. The present evaluation of the Sleeping Sound intervention at 12 months will determine whether the intervention is associated with long-term benefits for autistic children, or if continued support is needed to enable the maintenance of treatment gains beyond 6 months post-intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In addition to establishing the short and long-term efficacy of an intervention, it is crucial to understand for whom, and under what conditions an intervention may be more or less effective (Farmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>). Moderators of treatment outcomes can be defined as the characteristics that influence the relationship between intervention and outcome (Kraemer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>). Identifying moderators of treatment efficacy yields important clinical implications as it enables clinicians to prospectively recommend treatments to meet individual needs and maximise positive outcomes. The identification of treatment moderators is particularly pertinent in autism research, as the clinical heterogeneity of the disorder may result in different treatment responses from different subgroups of children (Hudry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>; Stahmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016</xref>; Vivanti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par8">A number of child and family factors have been proposed as moderators of behavioural intervention outcomes for autistic children. Child factors include variables such as age, gender, autism symptomatology and severity, IQ, co-occurring psychiatric conditions, and medication use (see Crank et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>; Gates et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref> for reviews). Family characteristics include level of parent education, family socio-economic status, parent age, parental mental health, and parental stress levels (see Shalev et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>; Trembath et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref> for reviews). Despite this research, there is a dearth of literature examining moderators of treatment outcomes for behavioural sleep interventions in autistic or youth populations more broadly. A RCT evaluating moderators of a cognitive-behavioural and mindfulness-based group sleep intervention for typically developing adolescents found that improvements in sleep quality were greatest among those with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms (Blake et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Moderators of behavioural sleep interventions have also been explored in a RCT using a sample of children with ADHD (Sciberras et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>). The results identified medication use and parental depression as moderators of treatment efficacy, indicating that the Sleeping Sound intervention was less efficacious for children who did not take ADHD medication and children of parents with depression. To date, no RCTs have explored moderators of treatment outcomes for autistic children receiving a behavioural sleep intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par9">In summary, behavioural sleep interventions are recognised as an efficacious, first-line approach for treating sleep problems in autism (Keogh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>). However, the degree to which these improvements are maintained over time is currently unknown. Moreover, little is known about the particular child or family characteristics that may be associated with varying degrees of treatment efficacy. The aims of the present study were threefold. First, we aimed to extend previous findings and examine whether the Sleeping Sound intervention for autistic children is associated with reduced sleep problems at 12 months post-randomisation. Second, we aimed to investigate the secondary longer-term impacts of the intervention on children’s quality of life, social, emotional, and behavioural functioning, and parent/caregivers’ stress levels, mental health, and quality of life. Third, we aimed to conduct an exploratory analysis to determine whether several putative child and family factors including child co-occurring conditions, age, sex, medication use, symptom severity, socioeconomic factors, and parent mental health are moderators of treatment outcomes over time. It was hypothesised that autistic children who received the Sleeping Sound intervention would show greater improvement in sleep problems and daytime functioning at 12 months post-randomisation, compared to a TAU control group.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and Eligibility</title>
                <p id="Par11">A total of 247 autistic children aged between 5 and 13 years was recruited through Victorian paediatric clinics and study advertisements in research, clinical, and community networks. Children were eligible if they had a multidisciplinary diagnosis of ASD, were aged 5–13 years, and scored ≥ 11 on the Social Communication Lifetime form (Rutter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2003</xref>). Children also needed to have moderate to severe caregiver-reported sleep problem(s) and meet diagnostic criteria for at least one caregiver-reported sleep problem as defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). Children were excluded if they had an intellectual disability, suspected sleep disordered breathing or Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, or co-occurring medical conditions known to impact sleep. Children of parents with insufficient English proficiency were also excluded. A comprehensive summary of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Appendix B. Two participants were excluded post-randomisation as they did not have formal diagnoses of ASD confirmed by a multidisciplinary team.</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p id="Par12">Parents/caregivers who registered interest in the study were contacted by a member of the research team via telephone to assess eligibility. The study was described and verbal informed consent obtained at the start of the screening call with parents. Eligible and interested families were provided with an information sheet, consent form, and baseline survey by email or post. Parents/caregivers who received the information and consent form by post provided consent by signing the hard copy document and returning it to researchers in a reply paid envelope. Parents/caregivers who received the information and consent form by email provided consent by typing their name and clicking ‘Yes’ to consent statements on a secure research database. Upon completion of consent form and baseline survey, participants were randomised to either the intervention group or the TAU control group by an independent researcher. Parents were sent surveys via email or post to assess outcomes at 12 months post-randomisation. Surveys were also sent to children’s school teachers if optional consent was provided by parents.

                <title>Randomisation and Blinding</title>
                <p id="Par13">Upon completion of the consent form and baseline survey, participants were randomised to the intervention group or the TAU control group. Families allocated to the TAU control group continued with their standard service of clinical care available in the community. With the exception of web-based psychoeducational resources, there are currently no services and supports tailored to Australian families of autistic children who have sleep difficulties. Sleep problems in autism are often addressed among a variety of other behavioural issues and advice is often generic. Treatment allocation was determined by an independent researcher using a computer-generated block randomisation sequence and was stratified by gender to ensure equal representation. Families with siblings enrolled in the study were assigned to the same group. Knowledge of group allocation was limited to the project coordinator and study clinicians. Chief investigators, members of the research team, and the statistician were blinded to participant group status to minimise potential bias. A detailed summary of the randomisation and blinding is outlined in our protocol paper (Papadopoulos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Moderating effects of sleep medication use, ASD severity, and parent mental health on primary outcomes over time</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10803_2022_5809_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par14">Families allocated to the intervention group received the Sleeping Sound behavioural sleep intervention by a study-employed clinician (paediatrician or psychologist) with experience working with autistic children. The intervention comprised two consecutive 50-min face-to-face consultations and one follow-up phone call at 2-week intervals consisting of assessment, goal-setting, psychoeducation, and a tailored sleep management plan. An overview of some of the key behavioural sleep strategies recommended to families are provided in Appendix A. To ensure treatment fidelity, study clinicians adhered to a standardised intervention manual and met fortnightly to discuss any clinical questions or issues. A detailed description of the Sleeping Sound intervention content is outlined in our protocol paper (Papadopoulos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>).</p>

                <title>Outcome Measures</title>
                <p id="Par15">The primary outcome was child sleep problems measured by the Children’s Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ; Owens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2000</xref>) at 12 months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes included child social, emotional, and behavioural functioning, child quality of life, child sleep hygiene and daytime sleepiness, child school attendance, parent stress and mental health, parent quality of life, and parent work attendance. Study measures and relevant psychometrics are summarised in Appendix C. Additional information collected at baseline included family and child demographics (e.g., gender, age, household income), and medical information (e.g., co-occurring conditions, medication use).</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec9">
                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p id="Par16">Analyses were undertaken using Stata version 15 and conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with participant data included as per initial treatment group allocation. To determine whether the Sleeping Sound intervention was associated with longer-term benefits, comparisons of continuous outcomes between the intervention and TAU groups at 12 months were made using linear mixed models. This approach involved fitting a single mixed model comparing baseline scores on an outcome measure to 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month scores for the same outcome, enabling a separate treatment effect at each follow-up time point. Count-based outcomes (days missed from school, days off work) were modelled using mixed-effects negative binomial models to control for overdispersion. This paper focuses on the 12-month treatment effects to extend our previously published work (Papadopoulos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>). Our study protocol (Papadopoulos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>) proposed clustering by individual (Level 2) and paediatrician (Level 3). However, for most variables, the clustering effect for paediatrician did not significantly deviate from zero based on comparison of log likelihood values for models with and without random intercepts at Level 3. Consequently, with the exception of outcomes that had a significant random intercept for paediatrician (school attendance, AQoL4d dimension: mental health), outcomes were tested with two-level mixed models, with clustering for within-participant effects.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Models are reported in unadjusted form, as well as adjusting for covariates identified a priori. Covariates used (child sex, age, ASD symptom severity, medication use, and socioeconomic status) were consistent with our published 3- and 6-month trial outcomes to ensure comparability (Papadopoulos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>). Effect sizes are reported as standardised mean differences, with values of ~ 0.20 considered small, ~ 0.50 moderate, and ~ 0.80 as large. Primary outcomes were tested with unadjusted <italic>p</italic> values, whereas <italic>p</italic> values reported for secondary outcomes were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg approach (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1995</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par18">Missing data were dealt with using conditional maximum likelihood estimation. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to evaluate the robustness of attained results to the possible presence of non-ignorable missingness patterns (i.e., missing not at random; MNAR). For the sensitivity analyses, pattern mixture models were used via the mimix package (Cro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>). Several multiple imputation options were tested with the mimix package, including last mean carried forward (LMCF; which imputes the mean at the previous timepoint from one’s assigned group), jump to reference (J2R; in which an individual’s missing data is imputed with the mean value from the control group at that timepoint) and copy increments in reference (CIR; in which an individual’s missing data is imputed with the mean increment from the previous timepoint for the control group regardless of treatment assignment at baseline). Interim missingness (i.e., when a participant has missing data at one timepoint but returns for a later wave) was treated as missing at random (MAR), which is a reasonable assumption for an intermittent response rather than complete dropout (Cro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>). A total of 50 imputations were undertaken per model.</p>
                <p id="Par19">To identify child and family moderators of the primary treatment outcome (child sleep problems as measured by the CSHQ), moderation analyses were conducted. Subgroups were defined via 13 dichotomous variables measured at baseline based on parent report: psychotropic medication use (yes/no), sleep medication use (yes/no), internalising comorbidity (anxiety and/or depression diagnosed or treated by a health professional: yes/ no), externalising comorbidity (conduct disorder and/or oppositional defiant disorder diagnosed or treated by a health professional: yes/no), combined internalising and externalising comorbidity (yes/no), ADHD comorbidity diagnosed or treated by a health professional (yes/no), ASD symptom severity (&lt; 15/ ≥ 15 on the SCQ total score), child age (5–9/10–13 years), child biological sex (male/female), parent level of education (has/not completed high school), parent mental health (&lt; 20/ ≥ 20 on the K10 total score), clinically significant parent stress (&lt; 114/ ≥ 114 on the PSI total score), and weekly household income categorised as below or above the national average reported in the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Household Income and Wealth report (&lt; $2000/ ≥ $2000 a week) (ABS, 2019). This allowed us to examine the effect of each subgroup on outcomes over the 12-month study period. Number of participants in moderator subgroups can be found in Appendix D. Once subgroups were defined, we repeated the linear mixed models with the inclusion of a 3-way interaction (subgroup x trial arm x timepoint) term to test whether the treatment effects differed for each of the subgroups over time. A significant 3-way interaction would indicate that the efficacy of the intervention varied as a function of the moderator. Sensitivity analyses (pattern mixture models) and follow-up simple slope analyses were undertaken on any significant 3-way interaction effects.</p>

                <p id="Par20">Data collection ceased early due to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In response to the pandemic, the Victorian Government declared a State of Emergency and implemented restrictions between March and May of 2020. During these times, there were only four reasons for Victorians to leave their home: food and supplies, medical care and care giving, exercise, and work or education if necessary (Victoria State Government Department of Health, 2020). Victorian schools were subject to remote learning throughout Term 2 and Term 3 and all research projects were paused, with students learning from home unless they were unable to be supervised. Following discussion with the research team, it was decided that sending follow-up surveys and reminders could place additional burden on participating families. The impact of the pandemic on children’s daily routines and consequent changes in parent-reported sleep problems were also considered. Accordingly, several parent (n = 24) and teacher (n = 24) final surveys and reminders that were due to be sent during the Victorian state of emergency (March – May 2020) were not sent. The last surveys were collected in February 2020, prior to the first lockdown being implemented in Victoria.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par29">Sleeping Sound, a brief behavioural sleep intervention that provides individually tailored strategies to children and their families, was associated with small to moderate sustained benefits in sleep at 12-month follow-up. Autistic children who were randomised to the intervention group fared better in terms of bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, parasomnias, and overall sleep problems compared to the TAU control group. While sustained benefits in child and parent daytime functioning were limited, there were small improvements in child reciprocal social interaction and parent mental health at 12-month follow-up. However, these effects became non-significant in two of three sensitivity analyses. Exploratory moderation analyses identified ASD severity, parent mental health, and sleep medication at baseline as moderators of long-term treatment outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Our findings are consistent with previous research indicating sustained improvements in sleep for autistic children who received a parent-mediated behavioural sleep intervention (Durand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>; van Deurs et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>; Weiskop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>). While these previous studies are limited by their small sample size and lack of control group, the current findings contribute to a limited body of evidence highlighting the durability of behavioural sleep interventions for autistic children. Moreover, the small to moderate effect sizes related to improved sleep in this study are consistent with the 6-month treatment outcomes of the Sleeping Sound with ASD trial (Papadopoulos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>) and the 12-month treatment outcomes of the Sleeping Sound with ADHD trial (Sciberras et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>). Our results provide further support for the long-term efficacy of Sleeping Sound in the treatment of sleep problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. It is noteworthy that improvements in sleep onset delay were maintained with a moderate effect size. As highlighted in a recent systematic review, difficulty falling asleep is prioritised by parents of autistic children as an outcome that is an important indicator of their child’s progress over time (McConachie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>). It is also one of the most common sleep concerns reported by parents of autistic children (Cortesi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>), therefore a sustained reduction in sleep latency as demonstrated in the present study is likely highly valuable to parents.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In contrast to our findings at 3- and 6-month follow-up (Papadopoulos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>), there were no significant differences in sleep anxiety and night waking between the intervention and TAU groups at 12-month follow-up. This may indicate that a booster session reinforcing strategies relating to the management of sleep anxiety and night waking might benefit parents/caregivers, though further research is required to identify the optimal period for this to be offered. The main behavioural strategy to address night wakings is bedtime fading, which has been shown to have lower regularity of use among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders compared to strategies related to healthy sleep practices (Pattison et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2022</xref>; Sciberras et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2022</xref>). The Sleeping Sound intervention does not address all behaviours captured on the CSHQ parasomnias subscale; however, autistic children who received the intervention reported lower parasomnia scores than children in the TAU group at 12-month follow-up. Some parasomnias such as night terrors are more likely to occur if a child is not getting enough sleep, thus it is possible that the significant improvements observed in sleep duration among the intervention group produced a flow-on effect.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Outcomes such as ability to manage relationships and parent wellbeing have been shown to be highly valued outcome measures for parents of autistic children (McConachie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>). We found significant, albeit small improvements at 12-month follow-up in child reciprocal social interaction and parent/caregiver mental health for families who received the Sleeping Sound intervention. However, improvements in secondary outcomes became non-significant in two of three sensitivity analyses. In an ADHD sample, Sleeping Sound was associated with small to moderate improvements in secondary child (ADHD severity, quality of life, daily functioning, behaviour) outcomes at 12-months post-randomisation (Sciberras et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>). The lack of sustained improvements across various parent- or teacher-reported secondary outcomes in the present study may be indicative of a decline in efficacy of treatment effects over time. This aligns with meta-analytic findings demonstrating a weakening of long-term effectiveness of CBT-I for sleep problems in non-autistic adults across a 12-month period (van der Zweerde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par33">We found evidence that sleep medication, ASD severity, and parent mental health were moderators of various sleep outcomes at 12-month follow-up. It should be noted that these effects also became non-significant in one or more sensitivity analyses with the most extreme assumptions and the following findings should be interpreted with caution. Children who were taking sleep medication at baseline showed greater long-term improvements in sleep duration than those not taking sleep medication. This finding is consistent with research that has demonstrated that melatonin can improve overall sleep time among autistic children (Abdelgadir et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>; Beresford et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>; Cuomo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>; Gringras et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>). The present study was not designed to evaluate the interaction between medication and behavioural therapy for the treatment of sleep disorders. Notwithstanding, the current finding suggests that sleep medication may serve as a ‘primer’ for behavioural sleep strategies, possibly through an additive physiological effect or by decreasing the stress of the bedtime routine. A RCT conducted by Cortesi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>) provides some preliminary evidence that combining melatonin and CBT for insomnia in autistic children may be more efficacious than melatonin or CBT alone; however, more research on the relationship between medication and behavioural intervention is needed.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Our findings also indicated that children whose parents were not experiencing psychological distress at baseline fared better at 12-months post-randomisation with regard to night waking and sleep duration. This result is perhaps not surprising, as parent mental health has been found significantly to influence response to parent-based interventions (Reyno &amp; McGrath, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>) and symptoms of anxiety and depression may make it challenging for parents/caregivers to consistently implement intervention strategies over an extended period of time. For parents/caregivers in the present study, poorer mental health at baseline may have hindered their capacity to understand and apply the strategies discussed during the intervention sessions. Consequently, the provision of additional support may be required to reinforce strategies and optimise outcomes for children of parents experiencing psychological distress.</p>
              <p id="Par35">We also found evidence that children with greater initial ASD severity fared better longer-term with regard to falling asleep compared to children with lower baseline ASD severity. One possible explanation for the current finding is that children with more severe autism are more likely to form rigid and persistent behavioural routines than children with milder forms of autism. Indeed, children with greater initial ASD severity in the present study had significantly higher scores on the Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Patterns of Behaviour subscale of the SCQ (<italic>M</italic> = 4.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.00) compared to children with lower baseline ASD severity (<italic>M</italic> = 3.14, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.27), <italic>t</italic> = -3.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. As such, strategies targeted at managing sleep onset delay (e.g., setting regular wake up time) may have been adhered to more strictly by children with greater ASD severity. While the developers of the SCQ state that the measure can be used as an index of autism severity (Rutter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2003</xref>), it should be noted that this is an approximate score and there is a dearth of research evaluating its use in efficacy trials. Future research exploring the relationship between autism severity and the maintenance of behaviour is warranted. Overall, the identification of very few moderators suggests that the Sleeping Sound intervention is likely suitable for most families of autistic children.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The present study has a number of strengths. It is the first 12-month follow-up of a RCT examining the efficacy of a brief behavioural sleep intervention for primary school-aged autistic children with sleep problems. Moreover, it is the first RCT to explore moderators of behavioural sleep treatment outcomes. Finally, our study is strengthened by its large, community sample.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Our study also has some limitations. We did not include an objective measure of sleep (i.e., actigraphy) and therefore relied on unblinded, parent-reported outcomes. While studies have shown high concordance between objective measures and parent reports of sleep problems (Souders et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>; Wiggs &amp; Stores, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2004</xref>), subjective measures pose potential limitations such as reporter bias and an unawareness of some sleep difficulties that may be unobservable or not communicated by the child (see Hodge et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref> for review). The dichotomisation of continuous variables in the moderation analysis also poses limitations, including loss of statistical power, increased risk of false positive results, and underestimates of variability within groups (see Altman &amp; Royston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2006</xref> for review). The generalisability of the findings is limited by the exclusion of autistic children with an intellectual disability and autistic children from non-English speaking backgrounds, thus the efficacy of the intervention in additional populations is unknown. Additional study limitations include the loss to follow-up at 12 months and the small teacher sample. We observed an attrition rate of 39% at the 12-month follow-up for parent/caregiver surveys, and 45% for teacher surveys. These limitations were further compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on data collection and changes in children’s teachers and schools over the 12-month period. There was no evidence to suggest that participants who did not complete the 12-month follow-up survey were those who observed less benefit at 3- or 6-month follow-up. As such, the larger attrition rate is unlikely to have led to inflated estimates of efficacy at 12-month follow-up.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Sleep problems are prevalent, burdensome, and persistent among autistic children. Sleeping Sound, a tailored behavioural sleep intervention, can provide families with an accessible and brief treatment option that yields sustained benefits. The intervention appears to be more beneficial in the longer-term for children taking sleep medication, children of parents who are not experiencing psychological distress, and children with greater ASD severity. As highlighted in the recent Lancet Commission on the future of care and clinical research in autism (Lord et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2022</xref>), clinical practice needs to respect the heterogeneity of the condition and recognise the unique strengths, needs, abilities, preferences, and circumstances of autistic individuals and their families. Personalised assessment and intervention should be accessible and equitable to everyone, and should encourage participation and empowerment of autistic individuals and their families (Lord et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2022</xref>). The Sleeping Sound intervention that was administered in our study is strengthened by its tailored nature, brevity, and applicability to everyday clinical practice. Our findings are important for clinicians seeking time efficient interventions for sleep problems in autism that can help to maximise positive and sustainable outcomes for children and their families. Future research investigating parental perceptions of participating in Sleeping Sound will inform future iterations of the intervention and provide a greater understanding of how the intervention can be optimised and translated into community healthcare settings.</p>
