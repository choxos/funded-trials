                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Although many people with chronic low back pain (LBP) improve following conservative treatment, one in five will experience worsening symptoms after discharge from treatment and seek health care again. The current LBP clinical care pathway in many health services lacks a well-integrated, systematic approach to support patients to remain physically active and self-manage their symptoms following discharge from treatment. Health coaching can support people to improve physical activity levels and may potentially reduce health care utilisation for LBP. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of introducing a coordinated support system (linking hospital outpatient physiotherapy services to a public health coaching service) at discharge from LBP treatment, on the future use of hospital, medical, and health services for LBP, compared with usual care provided at discharge.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Three hundred and seventy-four adults with chronic non-specific LBP will be recruited from the outpatient physiotherapy departments of public hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Participants will be individually randomised to a support system (<italic>n</italic> = 187) or usual care group (<italic>n</italic> = 187). All participants will receive usual care provided at discharge from treatment. Participants allocated to the support system will also receive up to 10 telephone-based health coaching sessions, delivered by the Get Healthy Service®, over a 6-month period. Health coaches will monitor and support participants to improve physical activity levels and achieve personal health-related goals. The primary outcome is the total number of encounters with hospital, medical, and health services for LBP, at 12 months from baseline. A within-trial economic evaluation will quantify the incremental costs and benefits of the support system from a health system perspective, to support reimbursement decision making.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">Low back pain (LBP) is the leading contributor to disability in Australia and globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Australia, nearly 4 million individuals report LBP at any one time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the total cost of treatment exceeds $9 billion annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Within the current model of care for LBP in most countries, patients are commonly referred to primary care for treatment, including physiotherapy services (private clinics and hospital outpatient departments) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although many people with LBP continue to improve following discharge from treatment, with approximately one third of individuals recovering within the first 9 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], one in five people experience recurrence of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and resort to seeking further care within 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For patients discharged after receiving treatment for LBP from hospital outpatient physiotherapy departments, this extra care may include additional pain medication intake, re-entry to the hospital system for further outpatient physiotherapy treatment, presentation to the emergency department, or surgical intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In Australia, local hospital networks are responsible for managing and linking public hospitals, health institutions, and health services across defined geographical areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This includes the provision of hospital-based outpatient physiotherapy services for people with LBP. In the Australian state of New South Wales, 15 local hospital networks (called local health districts) service a total population of 8.2 million people, across eight metropolitan and seven rural and regional locations. In the Western Sydney Local Health District, an ethnically and culturally diverse metropolitan region, the rate of re-presentation to hospital services (i.e., physiotherapy clinics, emergency departments, pain clinics, neurosurgical clinics) within 1 year after discharge from outpatient physiotherapy treatment for LBP is 21% (unpublished New South Wales hospital data). The high rate of re-presentation constitutes a financial burden of $AUD744,000 yearly in direct costs in this local health district alone. Extrapolating these estimates across all local health districts within New South Wales, the cumulative financial and resource burden of re-presentations following discharge from hospital outpatient physiotherapy treatment is undoubtedly substantial.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The decline in clinical outcomes and the additional use of care (i.e., hospital, medical, and health services) for this subset of the LBP population is likely to be amplified by the lack of an integrated, systematic, local health district-driven approach to support patients to self-manage their condition once physiotherapy treatment ceases. After a series of consultations with senior musculoskeletal clinicians and consumer groups representing patients with LBP in Sydney, Australia, we identified that the lack of a coordinated support system at discharge is considered a strong factor driving the pattern of patients returning to hospital for further treatment (unpublished New South Wales hospital consumer committee report). Patients who participated in focus groups expressed concerns regarding the overload of information delivered abruptly prior to discharge from treatment, as well as the lack of ongoing support available. As a result, patients reported poor confidence for self-management of symptoms and maintenance of positive health behaviours (i.e., adherence to exercise). The integration of a simple, low-cost but well-structured post-discharge support system into the care pathway of chronic LBP is likely to improve outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Health coaching is a behavioural approach that aims to support individuals living with chronic conditions to adopt sustainable health-promoting behaviours and improve their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The approach is strongly grounded in evidence-based behaviour-change theories such as Social Influence Theory and the Trans-theoretical Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and typically involves a qualified health coach using motivational interviewing techniques to support patients in achieving collaborative goals and empowering self-management of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Evidence supports that telephone-based health coaching can result in clinically important improvements in physical activity in patients with chronic LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This is important because people with chronic LBP who engage in moderate to high-intensity leisure-time physical activity have better outcomes in terms of pain, disability, and quality of life, than those who fail to maintain adequate levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our pilot study of a health coaching intervention for LBP has provided evidence that a telephone-based health coaching intervention is acceptable to LBP patients, can improve physical activity levels, and crucially, may reduce the rate of care-seeking for LBP by 38% [95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.18] compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, health coaching appears to have potential to support people with LBP to remain physically active and reduce their future use of health services for LBP.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service® (Get Healthy Service) delivers a variety of telephone-based health coaching programs for adults with a range of health behavioural risk factors and health complaints in the Australian states of New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Introduced in 2009, this is a well-established and fully operational service, funded by state governments, which provides health coaching programs at no charge for state residents. The goal of the Get Healthy Service® is to improve and support an individual’s capacity to self-manage their own health and wellbeing. The service currently offers a Standard (health) Coaching module which aims to support participants with goal setting, motivation, confidence to overcome barriers, and achievement of sustainable lifestyle changes (i.e., increased physical activity levels, reduced sedentary behaviour). Previous studies have shown that the Get Healthy Service® is effective in improving moderate and vigorous physical activity levels and reducing behavioural risk factors for chronic diseases (i.e., weight, waist circumference, body mass index, nutrition-related behaviours) in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Participants receive up to 10 individually tailored health coaching calls, delivered according to participant preference, over 6 months. The health coaching sessions are led by coaches with university-qualifications in allied health care (i.e., dietetics, exercise physiology), who monitor participants closely throughout the program to ensure they meet their goals safely. The sessions aim to compliment clinical care and offer accountability for treatment plans provided to patients by their clinicians prior to enrolment into the service. The service also has strong clinical governance and appropriate escalation pathways. The Get Healthy Service® is a viable and readily implementable solution that could be systematically integrated in the LBP clinical care pathway, potentially addressing the lack of support available after discharge from treatment across many regions in Australia.</p>
              <p id="Par29">There is only one published randomised controlled trial (RCT) which has evaluated the Get Healthy Service® in people with chronic LBP. The study investigated the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle intervention (incorporating the Get Healthy Service®) in people with chronic LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and found no effect on pain intensity, disability, physical activity, or health care use (assessed as health care utilisation over the past 6 weeks preceding assessment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the lack of effect in the study was likely due to poor adherence with treatment, and importantly, the study only recruited overweight or obese patients identified from a waiting list for consultation with an orthopaedic specialist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A protocol paper for a new study has been published for a RCT investigating a healthy lifestyle program involving consultations with a physiotherapist and dietician, provision of educational resources, and referral to the Get Healthy Service and a smoking cessation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The results of the trial have not been published; however, the protocol describes that study participants will be recruited from a mixed population of patients identified from primary and secondary care, and the general community. Further, the protocol does not describe any measurement of intervention effect on the use of medical or health services for LBP. No studies have investigated the effect of systematically integrating the Get Healthy Service® as a solution to support patients with chronic LBP immediately after discharge from hospital-based care.</p>
              <p id="Par30">This manuscript presents the protocol for a RCT and embedded qualitative study of a coordinated support system introduced after discharge from hospital-based physiotherapy treatment for chronic LBP. The support system will involve a structured referral pathway linking hospital-based outpatient physiotherapy services to a health coaching program, delivered by Get Healthy Service®, which has been tailored for chronic LBP. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of introducing a coordinated support system at discharge from LBP treatment, on the future use of hospital, medical, and health services for LBP, compared with usual care provided at discharge. The secondary aims of the study are: (i) to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the support system on improving pain, disability, physical activity levels, and quality of life in people with chronic LBP and (ii) to identify factors related to the intervention, context, individual, and implementation process which may contribute to intervention outcomes and to use these findings to inform development of an implementation plan for scalability.</p>

                  <p id="Par47">The primary outcome will be the total number of encounters with hospital, medical, and health services for LBP (composite measure) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] over 12 months from baseline assessment. The number of encounters of using hospital, medical, and health services for LBP could be related to a new or ongoing episode of LBP. Data will be collected at baseline, 6- and 12-months from baseline assessment, as well as fortnightly during the 12-month follow-up period, via online (electronic) self-reported questionnaires specifically designed for this study (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Data will also be collected via linkage to participants’ Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data. Encounters with hospital, medical, and health services for LBP will be defined as: (1) a visit to any hospital service due to LBP (e.g., emergency department presentations, inpatient admissions/hospitalisations, outpatient services (e.g., outpatient physiotherapy, pain clinics), surgical procedures due to LBP); (2) a visit to a community-based medical or health practitioner due to LBP (e.g., general practitioner, specialist clinician, physiotherapist); (3) any diagnostic test for LBP (e.g., imaging); (4) a visit to any hospital, medical and health services to receive or fulfill a script for prescription medications, or a visit to any non-hospital Medicare services for LBP. Data on item 4 will be obtained through linkage to participants’ Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data. Each encounter described above will be counted as an individual visit (e.g., a participant receiving 8 sessions of physiotherapy treatment will be considered as having 8 encounters). To account for data dependency, multiple encounters which occur within a 24-h period will be counted as one encounter.</p>

The physiotherapist will introduce the study to all candidate patients. For patients indicating interest in participation, their contact details will be provided to the research team. The research team will phone the potential participant to provide them with further information about the study, including the study documents. Those who confirm their interest in the trial will be invited to take part in the consent procedures with a research team member, which will ideally occur within 1–2 weeks prior to discharge from treatment. De-identified demographic data (age, sex) and LBP pain scores at discharge from treatment (assessed with the NRS) will be collected from all candidate patients, irrespective of their interest or provision of consent.

                  <p id="Par50">Depending on participant preference, consent procedures will occur face-to-face at the hospital site or remotely via an online consent form. For participants choosing to consent remotely, a research team member will provide support via phone call or video-conferencing software. During consent procedures, a research team member will discuss the study Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form with the participant (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Potential participants who agree to take part in the study will be asked to sign a paper or online version of the study consent form. After signing the study consent form, the participant will be enrolled into the study and immediately assigned a unique participant code, which will be used on all study documents to protect their privacy. In addition, the research team will request written consent from participants to access their Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme claims data.</p>
                  <p id="Par51">After consent procedures are completed, participants will be formally screened for eligibility and medical safety.

                <p id="Par52">Depending on participant preference, baseline assessment will occur face-to-face at the hospital site with a research assistant, or remotely. For participants completing baseline assessment remotely, a research team member will be available to provide support via phone call or video-conferencing software. Participants will be required to complete an online (electronic) baseline questionnaire to record demographic and anthropometric data (age, height, weight), and the study outcomes (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In addition, participants will be given a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity) to wear for 7 consecutive days on their right thigh. During the 7-day period, participants will be asked to document any physical activities or exercises completed in a paper-based logbook (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). After 7 days, participants will return the accelerometer and logbook to the research team via a pre-paid reply envelope. At baseline assessment, all participants will also receive a paper-based weekly diary (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>) to document any adverse events which may occur during the intervention period (6 months) - see below. For participants who complete the baseline assessment at the hospitals, the online baseline questionnaire will be completed on-site and the research team member will directly attach the accelerometer onto the participant’s thigh. For participants who complete the baseline assessment remotely, they will receive a link to the online baseline questionnaire via SMS or email, and any relevant study documents and equipment will be posted to them. The participant will receive a detailed sheet with labelled images and instructions on how to self-attach the accelerometer device (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

Treatment allocation will be performed using a computer-generated random allocation schedule operated by a remote unblinded researcher to ensure concealment. As participants will be randomised after discharge from treatment, with minimal potential for treatment contamination, randomisation will be at participant level. Randomisation will be by random permuted blocks of 4 and 6. Participants will be notified of their allocation via phone call from an unblinded research assistant. Select members of the research team will be unblinded to treatment allocation (i.e., main trial co-ordinator, the designated investigator managing referrals to the Get Healthy Service®, unblinded statistician monitoring trial safety, health coaches and agents from the Get Healthy Service®). Otherwise, all other research team members will remain blinded to treatment allocation. Participants will not be blinded to group allocation.</p>

                <p id="Par54">Participants in the usual care group will only receive the standard care delivered by their physiotherapist at discharge from outpatient treatment from participating hospitals. Usual care commonly involves the provision of advice, education, and a home-based exercise program, with no further intentional follow-up appointments arranged. Standard usual care at discharge may also involve referral to local community exercise providers, although the availability of these programs is highly variable across hospital sites and community regions. Participants in the usual care group will be able to continue seeking other forms of health care and treatments as desired.</p>

                  <p id="Par56">All participants who are randomised to the support system will be referred to the Get Healthy Service® via the same structured referral pathway. A designated investigator (clinician) at each hospital will manage the referral process for the site. The designated investigator will enter the contact information of participants randomised to the support system group into a digital referral channel on the Get Healthy Service® website, via an online form specifically designed for the study. Evidence of medical clearance will be provided to the Get Healthy Service® via a secure file transfer program, when required. Upon receipt of the referral, a staff member (intake specialist) from the Get Healthy Service® will phone trial participants to complete the registration call. During the registration phone call, the intake specialist will enrol the participant into the <italic>Standard Coaching</italic> module.

                  <p id="Par57">The Standard Coaching module will be delivered in accordance with its current features and specifications, but with some adaptation to align the content of the module with best practice for management of LBP. Participants will be offered up to 10 individually tailored phone-based health coaching sessions over a 6-month period. Sessions will be approximately 17 minutes in duration and will be led by health coaches with university-qualifications in allied health (i.e., dietetics and/or exercise physiology). All health coaches are required to complete training in health coaching, predominately acquired through HealthChange® Australia (2-day Core Training program) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], as well as internal training by clinical specialists as required. The sessions will be delivered to participants by their personal health coach, selected to match their goals and personal preference (i.e., male or female coach). The frequency of sessions will be tapered over the 6-month period according to each participant’s preference and progress through the program. The initial health coaching session will focus on mutually establishing the participant’s physical activity goals, as well as other health-related goals (i.e., reducing weight, achieving a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption) that are meaningful to the participant.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par87">Current models of care for LBP in the public health care systems of most countries, including Australia, lacks the capacity to support people with LBP after discharge from treatment. Whilst most patients achieve continual improvements after treatment cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], approximately one in five experience worsening symptoms after discharge and seek further care again within 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The economic and resource burden imposed on health care systems by this cyclical pattern is substantial, highlighting the persistence of an important gap in the chronic LBP clinical care pathway (i.e., abrupt therapeutic void and lack of support after treatment discharge).</p>
              <p id="Par88">From consultations with senior musculoskeletal clinicians and consumer groups representing patients with LBP, we identified that lack of a structured support system after completing hospital-based outpatient physiotherapy treatment for chronic LBP was considered a strong driving factor for patients seeking further treatment. This is consistent with findings from a systematic review examining perceived health information needs related to LBP: patients with LBP strongly express the desire to receive clear information about the ongoing availability of medical and allied health services, non-medical support from social networks and support groups, or work-specific support services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Similarly, a qualitative study of patient perceptions of self-managing chronic LBP following discharge from physiotherapy care also identified a strongly perceived need for self-management support following discharge from treatment (i.e., direct access and/or review appointments, telephone calls) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Together, these studies highlight that patients with LBP consistently desire the availability or awareness of support services after cessation of treatment; although, targeted patient education should be provided to contextualise the appropriate use of further medical and allied health services.</p>
              <p id="Par89">Currently in Australian public hospitals, local health district-driven approaches to support people with LBP after completion of hospital outpatient physiotherapy care are inconsistent, poorly coordinated, and generally lacking. Some hospitals may offer short-term general exercise classes or refer patients to local community exercise programs. However, the availability of such programs is highly variable across different hospitals and communities, and it is atypical for patients to receive further intentional follow-up appointments or support from their physiotherapist. Systematic reviews of international clinical guidelines and care pathways suggest that this pattern is similar globally. Guidelines also lack consistency in recommendations for provision of ongoing patient support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The existing model of care for chronic LBP globally appears insufficient to meet patient needs after treatment cessation.</p>
              <p id="Par90">There is an increasing global need to develop solutions for LBP that move beyond medicalised approaches for LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Improved solutions for chronic LBP should focus on incorporating conservative strategies that link education about LBP with sustainable positive lifestyle changes and pain-coping behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In particular, the proposed solution should also take into consideration patient preferences, including the provision of consistent, high-quality, tailored education regarding self-management strategies and the availability of support services for LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Further, there is increasing emphasis that care for chronic pain conditions, such as LBP, should be grounded in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Taken together, it seems that a supported self-management approach which incorporates community-based services may be a promising choice. The implementation of a simple, low-cost but well-structured post-discharge support service into the clinical care pathway for LBP could fill this gap.</p>
              <p id="Par91">Health coaching is an innovative and viable solution with strong potential to support LBP patients after discharge from treatment. Evidence from our pilot study supports that telephone-based health coaching can result in clinically important improvements in physical activity in patients with chronic LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and reduce the rate of care-seeking for the condition by 38% [95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.18], compared with usual post-discharge management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The Get Healthy Service® currently offers an established, well-structured, telephone-based health coaching program which focuses on supporting participants to develop self-efficacy in increasing physical activity levels, reducing sedentary behaviour, and achieving sustainable patient-centred goals. The Get Healthy Service® is fully funded by the New South Wales Ministry of Health and is free to use for state residents of three states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this study, we will test whether the introduction of a support system at discharge from hospital outpatient physiotherapy treatment for chronic LBP (involving a coordinated referral pathway linking hospital-based outpatient physiotherapy services to the Get Healthy Service®), reduces the number of re-presentations to medical, hospital, or health care services for LBP, as evidence of better support for maintenance of clinical improvements.</p>
              <p id="Par92">This manuscript presents the rationale and design of a RCT testing a novel support system which involves a structured referral pathway linking hospital-based outpatient physiotherapy services for chronic LBP to a health coaching program delivered by the Get Healthy Service®. The contents of the health coaching program will be tailored to meet the needs of people with chronic LBP. The support system will be compared with the usual care provided at discharge from outpatient physiotherapy care at each participating hospital site. Findings will evaluate the effect of the support system on the future use of hospital, medical, and health services for LBP, in people recently discharged from hospital outpatient physiotherapy treatment for chronic LBP and test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the support system for improving LBP symptom-related outcomes and behaviours (pain, disability, physical activity levels, quality of life). We also describe an embedded qualitative study designed to identify factors related to the intervention, context, individual, and implementation process which are likely to contribute to intervention success or otherwise. If positive, findings will inform the development of an implementation plan for scaling-up this approach, which could be disseminated across other health districts. Further, study findings could be disseminated across the general community to increase consumer awareness of the availability of physical activity-focused health coaching programs, which can be readily integrated into the discharge care pathway for patients receiving treatment for LBP.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par93">Community-driven solutions that support people with chronic LBP to better self-manage their condition and potentially reduce their use of further hospital, medical, and health services, after discharge from treatment, are urgently needed. The proposed study will test a novel support system which involves a structured referral pathway that directly links hospital-based outpatient physiotherapy services to the Get Healthy Service®. If positive, study findings will help to inform health care policy and clinical practice for chronic LBP in Australia.</p>
