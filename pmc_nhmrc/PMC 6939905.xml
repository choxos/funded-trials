                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We conducted a baseline community-based survey followed by a cluster randomised controlled trial of people with hypertension in 3 rural regions of South India, each at differing stages of epidemiological transition. Participants with hypertension, defined as BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive medication, were advised to visit a doctor. In each region, villages were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care (UC) in a 1:2 ratio. In intervention clusters, trained CHWs delivered a group-based intervention to people with hypertension. The program, conducted fortnightly for 3 months, included monitoring of BP, education about hypertension, and support for healthy lifestyle change. Outcomes were assessed approximately 2 months after completion of the intervention. The primary outcome was control of BP (BP &lt; 140/90 mm Hg), analysed using mixed effects regression, clustered by village within region and adjusted for baseline control of hypertension (using intention-to-treat principles). Of 2,382 potentially eligible people, 637 from 5 intervention clusters and 1,097 from 10 UC clusters were recruited between November 2015 and April 2016, with follow-up occurring in 459 in the intervention group and 1,012 in UC. Mean age was 56.9 years (SD 13.7). Baseline BP was similar between groups. Control of BP improved from baseline to follow-up more in the intervention group (from 227 [49.5%] to 320 [69.7%] individuals) than in the UC group (from 528 [52.2%] to 624 [61.7%] individuals) (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.1; <italic>P =</italic> 0.001). In secondary outcome analyses, there was a greater decline in systolic BP in the intervention than UC group (−5.0 mm Hg, 95% CI −7.1 to −3.0; <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001) and a greater decline in diastolic BP (−2.1 mm Hg, 95% CI −3.6 to −0.6; <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.006), but no detectable difference in the use of BP-lowering medications between groups (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8–1.9; <italic>P =</italic> 0.34). Similar results were found when using imputation analyses that included those lost to follow-up. Limitations include a relatively short follow-up period and use of outcome assessors who were not blinded to the group allocation.</p>

                  <p>While the durability of the effect is uncertain, this trial provides evidence that a low-cost program using CHWs to deliver an education and monitoring intervention is effective in controlling BP and is potentially scalable in resource-poor settings globally.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hypertension is the largest contributor to the global burden of disease, and has a prevalence that has almost doubled over the last 25 years, from 442 million in 1990 to 874 million in 2015 [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This growth has occurred most rapidly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which now account for the majority of those with hypertension (66%) [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. India, with rapidly rising prevalence of hypertension also occurring in rural regions [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is now well on its way to becoming the global “hypertension capital” [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Controlling hypertension is paramount for reducing risks of adverse outcomes, but there are significant barriers to its control, particularly in rural regions [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, awareness of having hypertension is significantly less among those with hypertension in rural (mean 25%) than urban (mean 42%) India [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and differs markedly across rural regions [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, patients often do not receive evidence-based care for hypertension, with a recent review providing evidence that only 25% of people with hypertension in rural India were receiving treatment, and only 11% had their blood pressure (BP) controlled [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Such inadequate care is partly due to a shortage of doctors (below 1:20,000 in some regions) [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and doctor absenteeism in public health centres [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other barriers include the cost of treatment and the lack of availability of medications [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Sharing tasks between community health workers (CHWs) and doctors is a promising and potentially scalable approach for delivering care for hypertension in hard-to-reach settings [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as it improves access to healthcare and reduces costs associated with treatment [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Only 7 studies have incorporated this approach to managing hypertension in LMICs [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and in another study, it was unclear whether the staff sharing the tasks were nurses or CHWs [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, only 4 of the studies included a randomised comparator [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While there were reductions in BP and improved control of hypertension, the interventions cited in these studies were all resource-intensive individualised approaches. None incorporated a group-based approach, which has been shown to reduce costs in other diseases [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], thereby enhancing scalability.</p>
              <p>We aimed to determine whether a CHW-led group-based education and monitoring program for the management of hypertension is effective, both individually and by region, in rural India. We used a cluster design to facilitate our group-based approach.</p>

                <title>Participant baseline assessments</title>
                <p>Prior to commencing the study, we engaged with local village leaders in each region. Then, a team of trained research assistants conducted a baseline community-based survey between September 2013 and December 2015. We measured BP and anthropometry and conducted interviews to elicit details on use of medications, demographics, lifestyle behaviours, and access to healthcare. Arterial BP was measured after the participant had been seated quietly for at least 15 minutes. Three measurements were taken at 3-minute intervals using the appropriate cuff size and a calibrated digital automatic BP monitor (OMRON HEM-907, OMRON Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan) according to the WHO STEPS protocol, modified only by using the right arm for all measurements [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Measurement continued until 2 consecutive readings differed by &lt;10 mm Hg systolic and &lt;6 mm Hg diastolic, with a maximum of 5 measurements. The mean of the last 2 consecutive measurements was considered the baseline BP level for each participant.</p>
                <p>We measured height to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer (213, Seca, Hamburg, Germany) and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg using a portable digital weighing scale (9000SV3R, Salter, Kent, UK). Waist and hip circumference were measured using a spring-loaded tension tape (Gulick M-22C, Patterson Medical, Illinois, US) in a private setting. In accordance with the WHO STEPS protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the lowest rib and upper point of the iliac crest and at the end of normal expiration, while hip circumference was measured at the maximum protrusion of the buttocks.</p>
                <p>At the time of the baseline survey, all participants with systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg were informed they may have hypertension and were advised to visit a doctor to have their BP re-checked.</p>

                <p>Participants re-assessed for eligibility to be recruited to the cRCT were those identified as potentially hypertensive in the baseline community-based survey. Because of limited resources, we did not recruit or follow-up participants in all PSUs. Instead the lead investigator (AGT), located off site, used a computer-generated random sequence to randomly allocate 20% of PSUs to the intervention and 40% to usual care (UC) in each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002997.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Eligibility of all potential participants within these PSUs was determined prior to enrolment [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], using the following definition for hypertension: (1) self-report of an existing diagnosis of hypertension; (2) use of antihypertensive medications; (3) SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg in the baseline community-based survey, with a subsequent diagnosis of hypertension by their primary healthcare provider; or (4) SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg both in the baseline survey and at another measurement prior to recruitment to the cRCT. All people with verified hypertension, i.e., satisfying any of the above criteria, were invited to participate by the study field staff, and comprised the intention-to-treat group.</p>

First, the results of focus group discussion and preliminary analyses of the baseline survey drove content for the educational materials. These interactions highlighted poor knowledge of hypertension and poor access to health services. CHWs who were involved in the pilot training and local clinicians in the Rishi Valley (K. Kar. and K. Kal.) also provided feedback on this content, enabling refinement of the educational resources. In addition, in October 2014 a stakeholder meeting was held in which experts from the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research and an independent researcher provided input as to how this approach could fit within the Indian health system.</p>

                <p>The intervention consisted of 6 fortnightly sessions of ~90 minutes, held within the villages (clusters) in which the participants resided, and delivered over 3 months. Each participant in an intervention cluster was allocated to 1 of 32 groups in which the intervention was delivered: 6 in the Rishi Valley, 14 in West Godavari, and 12 in Trivandrum. CHWs encouraged group members to attend all 6 sessions. At the start of each fortnightly session, CHWs measured BP and weighed all participants to assist with self-management. During each session, they delivered education about hypertension and how to manage it, in the local language [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This included details about adhering to medications and the importance of making lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and following a healthier diet. Pictorial flipcharts were used as education aids, and handouts were provided to participants to use at home. Full details of the education provided, including all session flipcharts and handouts, are available online (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.4225/03/5967f9a94970d">10.4225/03/5967f9a94970d</ext-link> [English version]).

The primary outcome was a change from baseline in the proportion of people with controlled hypertension (BP &lt; 140/90 mm Hg), as outlined in our clinical trial registration. Secondary BP outcomes, as listed in our published protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], included change in SBP and DBP from baseline, measured in an identical way to the baseline survey in accordance with the WHO STEPS protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other outcomes comprised changes in use of antihypertensive medications, body mass index (BMI), waist–hip ratio (WHR), and lifestyle behaviours (physical activity, fruit and salt intake, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption).</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>Our original sample size was based on a mean SBP among people with hypertension of 147 mm Hg (SD 22) and a 6–mm Hg reduction with the intervention, slightly less than that seen in an earlier trial of hypertension in a developed country [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We further estimated 100 participants per cluster (30 clusters) and presumed an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.047, giving a design effect of 5.653 [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. At a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, and adjusting for clustering (i.e., adjusting for the design effect), we estimated requiring 1,097 people with hypertension per study arm. However, as we had insufficient resources to include all of the clusters in the subsequently designed cRCT, our eventual sample size was projected to be less than this, leading us to initially propose this as a feasibility study. Towards the end of the baseline survey, a preliminary analysis of mean baseline SBP in 15 clusters revealed that the ICC among those with SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg was 0.01, with 37% having controlled hypertension. Estimating an average cluster size of 120 yielded a design effect of 2.19 (1 + [119 × 0.01] = 2.19). Using a 1:2 ratio for the intervention versus UC and a power of 80% to detect a difference in the proportion with controlled BP of 37% in UC versus 50% in the intervention group resulted in an initial required sample size of 170 in the intervention group and 339 in UC. Multiplying by the design effect (i.e., 2.19), to ensure adequate power for a cRCT, resulted in a requirement of 372 in the intervention group and 742 in UC. From the baseline survey, we estimated that we would have approximately 600 in the intervention group and 1,200 in UC. This sample size would give us 94% power to detect the same level of effect (i.e., difference in the proportion with controlled BP of 37% in UC versus 50% in the intervention group), hence providing the rationale to analyse this as a stand-alone cRCT. Sample size was determined for the whole sample and not for subgroups, i.e., site or sex.</p>

                <p>Data from questionnaires were captured into an electronic database using TeleForm version 10.5 (Cardiff Software, CA, US). The data were cleaned by identifying outliers. Potential errors in these outliers were checked with the original forms and by seeking clarification from the research sites. Errors identified in this way were then corrected.</p>
                <p>In the analysis we followed intention-to-treat principles (Stata IC/11.2, StataCorp, College Station, TX, US). ANOVA was used to determine whether baseline characteristics (continuous variables) differed significantly between treatment groups, and between regions, and whether the differences between the treatment groups varied according to region. Tukey’s test was applied to determine which regions differed. Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used to detect whether differences existed between the treatment groups in each of the 3 regions, so a Bonferroni correction was applied to protect against increased risk of type I error. Differences in categorical variables between regions and treatment groups were analysed using chi-squared tests with Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons between and within regions. Two-tailed <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome comprised mixed effects logistic regression analyses, clustered by village within region and adjusted for baseline control of BP, conducted to determine the odds for control of BP for the intervention versus UC group. We used similar analyses to determine the odds of prescription of antihypertensive medication (a secondary analysis). Separate analyses were conducted for women and men.</p>
                <p>In sensitivity analyses that included all eligible participants, the outcome data from individuals who dropped out of the study were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations as some variables were binary and others continuous. Twenty imputed datasets were created for each relevant outcome variable. Details of the proportion of missing observations imputed for each variable and the variables used in each imputation model are provided in the footnotes to tables and figures.</p>
                <p>For imputed outcomes, differences in categorical variables between groups were initially assessed using a 2-sample test of proportions, while linear regression was used to determine differences in continuous variables. Further, sensitivity analyses using the same methods were conducted in those whose BP was uncontrolled at baseline, but without baseline adjustment.</p>
                <p>Mixed effects linear regression analyses, adjusted for baseline control of BP and clustered by village within region, were used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing SBP and DBP (secondary analyses). Separate analyses were conducted for women and men.</p>

We obtained official approval from the CTRI on 25 February 2016 (CTRI/2016/006678), notably with no changes to the protocol from our original application.</p>

              <p>This cRCT, conducted in rural India, provides evidence that a group-based education and monitoring program, delivered by health workers, is effective in reducing SBP and DBP and in improving control of hypertension. The intervention was effective in all 3 regions, which are at differing stages of the economic and epidemiological transition, indicating that the intervention could be effective and scalable across rural India. With an estimated prevalence of hypertension of 25% among adults in rural India [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], our intervention is thus potentially scalable to more than 100 million adults with hypertension living in rural India.</p>
              <p>Our intervention has enormous potential for reducing BP and improving control of hypertension in poor and hard-to-reach settings. This was just a 3-month intervention, yet the BP reduction attained was comparable to that observed in clinical trials of BP-lowering medications, equating to a 20% reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease and vascular death [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Apart from the education provided to intervention participants in a group setting, at each session participants also had their BP measured. This ongoing monitoring may have empowered participants to determine whether and how their lifestyle changes resulted in tangible benefits [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This approach also provides motivation for continuing behavioural changes or adopting new ones [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and this may be one of the mechanisms for the success of the intervention. Furthermore, the program included several components that were evidence-based for improving the control of hypertension. These components included improving the adherence to antihypertensive medications [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], providing regular monitoring of BP [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and encouraging lifestyle changes such as losing excess weight and increasing physical activity [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>Trained professionals are not always available in rural and remote settings [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, training the existing workforce in specific tasks, such as monitoring BP and providing education and support, that do not require clinical decision-making but can be implemented using evidence-based protocols, enables a reorganisation of health tasks to improve access and minimise costs [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although other investigators have also shown the effectiveness of task-shifting management of hypertension to CHWs [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], major limitations included that these studies involved intensive, time-consuming individual-based interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], lacked a UC group [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or provided home BP monitors (equipment unaffordable to the poor) [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our approach, using a group-based intervention, provides a novel, effective, and potentially cheaper and sustainable alternative to managing hypertension in disadvantaged and hard-to-reach settings.</p>
              <p>Our findings confirm and extend those from other task-sharing intervention programs of the effect of education programs in LMICs. He et al. reported a 6.6/5.4–mm Hg greater reduction in BP in participants exposed to a CHW-led multicomponent education and coaching program, home BP monitoring, text messaging, and better trained physicians than in those receiving UC [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A similar decrease of 5 mm Hg of SBP was reported by Jafar et al. in Pakistan in a group exposed to home health education and upskilled general practitioners, compared to other groups [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and Neupane et al. reported a 4.9–mm Hg greater decrease in SBP in a group in Nepal with home-monitoring and education, compared to UC [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, all 3 studies were of individualised-care approaches, which are likely to be more resource-intensive than our group-based approach.</p>
              <p>Simple surveillance may be an incentive to patients to take steps to reduce their BP levels in regions with poor access to healthcare. There was a large improvement in SBP and DBP in the UC group in the Rishi Valley region, a decline of 9.5/6.8 mm Hg. Following the baseline community-based survey, participants who had BP levels of ≥140/90 mm Hg were informed that their BP was high and that this might put them at risk of other diseases, and were advised to visit a doctor. While some of the observed decline in BP could be regression to the mean, it might also suggest that BP surveillance itself can help control BP in regions with poor access to healthcare.</p>
              <p>It was notable that the effect of the intervention did not appear to be attributable to new prescription of antihypertensive medication at follow-up. Potentially, BP may have declined with the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits, with some evidence of reductions in alcohol consumption, an effect largely seen in men as few women consumed alcohol at baseline. There was some evidence that adding salt to food declined, but as most of the salt in the diet is added in the cooking process, it is unlikely that reducing salt at the table would explain the BP reductions observed.</p>
              <sec id="sec027">
                <title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
                <p>There were some limitations to our study that may influence the interpretation of our findings. Although the sample size was large overall, the number of participants in the Rishi Valley was less than half the number of participants in either of the other 2 regions. Of the individuals with hypertension identified in the baseline community-based survey in each region, we recruited approximately 20% to the intervention group and 40% to the UC group. However, the baseline prevalence of hypertension was the least in the Rishi Valley, and even though we surveyed a larger number of people, it was not sufficient to ensure similar group sizes. In addition, a total of 263 individuals dropped out of the study, most of whom were in the intervention group. This raises potential issues around the intention-to-treat approach, with subsequent potential biases, as discussed by Giraudeau and Ravaud [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We minimised bias by randomising clusters after the baseline community-based survey was conducted, and so we had baseline data on all those who participated in the baseline survey. Although some people then dropped out, we included these individuals in a sensitivity analysis by imputing their outcome, thereby reducing the potential bias of excluding these individuals who dropped out. Of note, the findings for the 2 regions with a larger number of individuals who dropped out are consistent with those from the West Godavari region, where only 24 individuals dropped out, adding to the credence of our findings. There were also no empty clusters. We also acknowledge that both the 3-month intervention and the follow-up period of 6–8 weeks, between the last session of the program and assessment of outcomes, were relatively short. Because of this, we cannot determine whether there is a long-lasting improvement in controlling hypertension from our group-based education and monitoring program. It is also possible that there was some selection bias as the control of BP was relatively high at baseline, being approximately 50%. Indeed, in those who did not participate, only 19.9% had their BP controlled at baseline, indicating that extra efforts should be made to improve the reach of the intervention. There could potentially have been some post-randomisation selection bias as individuals were recruited following randomisation of their village. However, potential participants were blinded to the recruitment status of their village at the time that their eligibility was established and their recruitment sought, thereby reducing this potential bias. Another limitation of our study is that it was not possible to blind the outcome assessors to the treatment allocation of the individuals as the assessors were instrumental in observing the fidelity of the intervention. However, we reduced the impact of detection bias on our main outcome measures by using digital automated BP monitors, thereby limiting the influence of the perceptions of the outcome assessors that might have arisen with the use of auscultation. A further limitation is that, for logistic reasons, details about salt intake were asked of individuals only about salt added at the table. However, as most of the salt consumed is added during cooking, these details would have been better obtained from the person responsible for the cooking. Thus, the data we generated on salt consumption should be interpreted with caution. Some of the reduction in BP observed may be attributable to the Hawthorne effect, whereby participants alter behaviours just because they are being observed. However, this does not discount the difference that we observed between the UC and intervention groups, comprising a randomised comparison.</p>
                <p>There are several strengths to our study, including the cluster-randomised allocation of the PSUs to facilitate delivery of the group-based intervention, and the consistency in the delivery of the program in all 3 regions. The PSUs were geographically separated and had different CHWs, thereby minimising contamination between groups. Another major strength is our inclusion of 3 very diverse regions of rural India using the available workforce, so that our findings may be generalisable to a large portion of rural India. Additionally, the sample size of our project was large, thereby reducing the likelihood of a chance finding. Furthermore, our study included a UC comparator, which enabled us to minimise the effects of other variables. Only 4 prior trials of CHW-led task-shifting intervention programs to treat hypertension included a clearly defined UC group [<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002997.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], so our study is one of the few to have a robust comparator to test the effectiveness of the intervention.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>Our program was effective in increasing the proportion who had control of hypertension, and in reducing both SBP and DBP. Simple surveillance also appeared to result in reduced BP in these rural settings. Our findings add to the limited research on task-shifting interventions for treating hypertension in LMICs. In particular, we have shown that this intervention is applicable across very diverse rural settings, so there is considerable potential to implement and scale up across rural India and potentially other resource-poor regions in other countries. Future programs incorporating comprehensive collection of data on changes in medication use, changes to lifestyle behaviours, and knowledge of hypertension may help tease out which factors are best targeted to improve the control of hypertension in these settings.</p>
