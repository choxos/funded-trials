                  <title>Aim</title>
                  <p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) has far reaching impacts for young people, their families and society. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the first‐line treatments for young people experiencing MDD; however, there is limited research examining how young people with MDD experience CBT. The aim of this study was to explore their experience and their views of this intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="eip13290-sec-0002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We employed a qualitative research design, with semi‐structured interviews and thematic analysis. Eight participants aged between 17 and 24 years who received CBT for MDD in a randomized controlled trial were recruited.</p>

                <sec id="eip13290-sec-0003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Five themes were identified: the importance of relationship with clinician; the range of useful components within CBT; the ability for CBT to accommodate different techniques and presenting issues; the importance of checking in with clients during the process of therapy; and the impacts of MDD on therapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="eip13290-sec-0004">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The findings highlight the importance of clinicians having a youth friendly and collaborative approach that allows a modular delivery of a range of CBT techniques to suit the client's presenting issue and formulation. There is a need to continually check how young people are responding to interventions, and to be aware of potential cognitive deficits and adjust therapy accordingly. This is a small study that provides insight into how young people with MDD experience CBT and avenues to explore for tailoring provision of CBT to enhance the therapeutic experience for this population.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Depressive disorders are characterized by the presence of persistent and unreactive low mood, or irritability in those younger than 18 years, accompanied by a range of cognitive and behavioural symptoms that persist over time and cause clinically significant impairment (DSM‐5, American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The 12‐month prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in 11‐ to 17‐year‐olds in Australia is 10.5% (Lawrence et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and 6.3% amongst 16‐ to 24‐years‐olds (Australian Bureau of Statistics, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Its onset during this time potentially disrupts the most productive years of life and is a key reason that MDD is the single largest contributor to global disability (WHO, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Earlier age of onset more likely to result in adverse psychological and psychosocial outcomes (Zisook et al., 2007) such as impaired social relationships, family functioning, occupational functioning (Hirschfeild et al., Hirschfeld et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), educational underachievement and unemployment (Birmaher et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Fergusson &amp; Woodward, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Lewinsohn et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). MDD is also associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, attempts and death by suicide (Fergusson et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Gould et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; WHO, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Guidelines recommend CBT as a first‐line treatment for MDD in young people, with medication initiated if there is a poor response (Beyondblue., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; NICE, , <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The most recent evidence about antidepressants shows that, on average, there are only very small improvements in depression symptoms for those on antidepressants compared with those on placebo (Hetrick et al., 2020). There is also evidence that antidepressants increase the risk of suicide related behaviours. While there is only a small evidence base, the best approach is for medication to be used in combination with psychotherapy (March et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p>
              <p>Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy have the strongest evidence base of all the psychological treatments for MDD (NICE, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) with CBT also showing promise as an intervention for suicidal behaviours (Hawton et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). CBT combines behavioural techniques designed to elicit alternate appraisals and change maladaptive assumptions, and cognitive techniques that assist in identification, testing and correction of dysfunctional beliefs (Feehan, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).</p>
              <p>Young people's experience of therapy generally, and CBT specifically, has not been examined widely, but is increasingly recognized as an important aspect of understanding outcomes and informing ways to improve treatment delivery (Donnellan et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Midgley et al., 2014; Neelakantan et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The developmental context has been highlighted as important in terms of young people's motivation, engagement and experience in therapy (Sauter et al., 2009). For example, the need for autonomy, privacy and confidentiality are commonly described as important. Careful attention to the early stages of engagement, and a focus on the primary importance of the therapeutic relationship and a sense of real connection has also been described as important (Gibson &amp; Cartwright, 2014; Neelakantan et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Sauter et al., 2009; Wilmots et al., 2020). Also important to consider are the emotional and cognitive capabilities of young people (Sauter et al., 2009) and how this might impact on engagement. For example, various CBT techniques, particularly cognitive techniques, may be impacted by neurocognitive impairment associated with MDD, and the severity and complexity of their presentations (Allot et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Allott et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Hetrick et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Importantly, the value of manualized treatment is an important consideration with a range of views about the impact on engagement and efficacy (Addis &amp; Krasnow, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, Nelson et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Truijens et al., 2018).</p>
              <p>The aim of the present qualitative study was to explore young people's subjective experience of CBT for depression to further understand views regarding this treatment. To date, very little research of this sort has been undertaken, particularly in young people. We know of only one small study including three young females with depression (12–16 years). The results of this study showed that engagement, the therapeutic relationship, the impact of CBT on change, and the manner in which CBT was delivered were key change promoting factors (Donnelan, Murray, &amp; Harrison, Donnellan et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Understanding a client's experience and perspective helps to understand what is useful within the therapeutic relationship and content (Hodgetts &amp; Wright, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and has the potential to lead to improvements in treatment and services (Day, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>This was a qualitative study using a general inductive approach, which is appropriate when there are specific research aims and objectives (Thomas, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In this approach, data are examined in the context of being guided by objectives, but findings are based on those data not on a‐priori expectations based on the objectives. The data were the responses of participants to semi‐structured interviews (see <xref rid="eip13290-app-0001" ref-type="app">Appendix</xref> for the interview guide).</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>The study was undertaken in headspace enhanced primary care centres (Glenroy, Sunshine, and Werribee) in the Northwestern region of Melbourne (McGorry et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Young people eligible for the study were aged 15–25 years, attending a headspace centre with moderate to severe MDD, who had consented to take part in the Youth Depression Alleviation Randomized Controlled Trial (YoDA‐C; Davey et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The trial (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 153) investigated the effectiveness of 12 weeks of manualized CBT plus fluoxetine, compared with manualized CBT plus placebo, for the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe MDD (Hetrick et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>. Detailed methodological information on this trial is reported elsewhere (Davey et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
                <p>A purposive approach to sampling was used that considered age, gender, geographic location, medication, number of therapy sessions and recency of involvement in the trial. We were careful to ensure that the sampling was consistent with the characteristics of the overall YoDA‐C sample. In total, eight young people participated in this study; three were male and five were female aged between 16 and 23. They had engaged in a range of 3 and 10 sessions of CBT over a range of 1 year and 1 month to 2 years and 4 months prior to being interviewed (see Table <xref rid="eip13290-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> for details).</p>

The aim was to maximize the advantages of manualized treatment in terms of ensuring delivery of CBT with fidelity to this intervention, while allowing flexibility to ensure treatment was based on a thorough assessment and ongoing formulation of the young person's treatment needs. This flexibility was deemed necessary given concerns in the literature about negative impacts on therapeutic alliance by use of a manual (Addis &amp; Krasnow, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Nelson et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Its development drew on existing (at the time) treatment manuals, particularly the Adolescent Coping with Depression manual (Clarke et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) and the Treatment of Adolescent Depression Study (TADS; March et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) treatment manual, which was a modular approach to treatment and also drew on the Adolescent Coping with Depression manual. Rather than allowing complete flexibility in modular delivery, as had been permitted in the TADs trial, and consistent with the central components identified in prior research studies and reviews (McCarty &amp; Weisz, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Weersing et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), seven modules were deemed ‘core’ with the expectation that these would be delivered; a further seven targeted modules were provided that could be delivered if indicated. Core modules included psychoeducation; understanding and monitoring emotions; behavioural activation; activating event‐beliefs‐consequences (ABC) model and chain analysis; identifying automatic thoughts; working with unhelpful thinking; and relapse prevention. The manual also provided comprehensive resources and handouts.</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>This study received ethics approval from the Melbourne Health Research and Ethics Committee (HREC/12/MH/151) and Australian Catholic University (2017‐344R). Young people were contacted by the first author, and those who consented were offered an interview time at a local clinical service or via telephone.</p>
                <p>Interviews, which were all conducted by phone, followed an interview guide, and were undertaken by the lead author who was training as a clinical psychologist and had been a research assistant on the RCT. She took notes on her reflections of the interview, which took between 30 and 60 min and were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis as outlined by Braun and Clark (<xref rid="eip13290-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). This involved identifying, analysing and categorizing a pattern of themes within and across interviews (Burnard et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The data were analysed independently by two investigators (N.F. and S.H.) as they were collected, with attention paid to the lens through which the data were being viewed (N.F. had been a research assistant on the RCT and S.H. an investigator and delivered CBT within the RCT). Observations and discrepancies were discussed and consensus reached.</p>

                <p>Five themes and nested sub‐themes emerged from the data: the importance of relationship with clinician, the range of useful components within CBT, the ability for CBT to accommodate different techniques and presenting issues, the importance of checking in with clients in the process of therapy, and the impacts of MDD on therapy.

                <title>Theme 1: The importance of relationship with clinician</title>
                <p>Young people described a range of initial experiences, which highlighted the importance of engagement (sub‐theme 1) whereby the clinician is able to ensure the young person feels comfortable in the therapeutic relationship and is put at ease. Secondly, there was initial ambivalence and time was needed to develop a relationship (sub‐theme 2). This initial ambivalence was related to how the clinician was perceived to first engage (e.g., friendly or condescending), and the perception of being heard and understood developed over time, which impacted on trust and allowed the relationship to build over time. The <italic toggle="yes">use of a manual did not impact therapy (sub‐theme 3)</italic> in the same way as the therapeutic relationship. Not all clients were aware of the use of a manual until the interview, and reflection on the manual‐based therapy in this context appeared as positive. One participant, who had received CBT from the same clinician prior to participation in the YODA‐C trial, expressed a preference for the manualized approach.</p>

                <p>Participants identified that <italic toggle="yes">various modular components have their place and are useful (sub‐theme 1)</italic>. Participants described how behavioural skills were utilized, reflecting on the emphasis in the therapy of behavioural activities.

For those who received it, social skills training was crucial and helpful, for example for one participant having challenges with her sister. Problem solving was described as practical and useful and it was a skill that continued to be used. <italic toggle="yes">Homework is accepted when presented in a manageable way (sub‐theme 2)</italic>. Most participants were positive about homework tasks, describing them as manageable and helpful. However, there were challenges relating to homework that were related to motivation and memory. Finally, if a particular technique worked for them, participants expressed a willingness to continue using it: <italic toggle="yes">Techniques that work, young people carry on with (sub‐theme 3)</italic>. This was noted generally but participants also noted particular CBT techniques that they continued to use. For example, problem solving was used by one participant and another participant described her ongoing use of social skills and the usefulness of behavioural activation.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Within a qualitative framework, the current study investigated the experiences of eight young people diagnosed with MDD who received CBT with placebo or fluoxetine in a research trial. The themes identified in this study provide insight into how CBT is experienced. There were five key themes that emerged from the data highlighting that there are a range of useful CBT skills and techniques that young people learn in the context of a positive relationship with their therapist, as well as the importance of a collaborative approach that is sensitive to the various presenting issues and reactions to information and therapeutic techniques that are delivered.</p>
              <p>Participants highlighted the importance of having a positive and engaging relationship with their clinician. Specifically, that it is important for clinicians working with this population to be warm and friendly. Most participants acknowledged feeling initial ambivalence, and that the client/clinician relationship developed over time, assisting their engagement in treatment. It emerged that it is crucial for clinicians to be sensitive to clients' reactions from the outset of the therapeutic relationship, particularly with regard to delivering information about diagnosis, and to modify their approach based on these reactions. Also crucial is the ability to ensure that the concerns of the young person, as they present them, are central to understanding their needs. This is consistent with prior research highlighting the central importance of the therapeutic relationship, which also requires the therapy to understand and respond to the development needs for autonomy, privacy, confidentiality (Gibson &amp; Cartwright, 2014; Neelakantan et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Sauter et al., 2009; Wilmots et al., 2020). Further, it is consistent with guidelines around developing a therapeutic relationship, which encourage making collaborative decision‐making and seeking feedback throughout therapy (Beck, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>Importantly, this research has demonstrated that young people in this qualitative study responded differently to various components of CBT, supporting the use of a modular approach to implementing CBT that can be tailored to individual needs. In this context, it appeared that clinicians were able to use a manual in an unobtrusive and effective way. This type of approach has been successfully implemented by Weisz et al. in adolescents with depression, anxiety and conduct problems (Weisz et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The usefulness and practical benefits of the behavioural components were highlighted, and this is perhaps not surprising given they align with what young people identify as natural or habitual coping mechanisms (Ng et al., 2016). However, the data indicated that cognitive restructuring and homework, which are potentially more challenging aspects of CBT, can be presented in a way that facilitates young people's engagement with them. The data indicated that young people interpreted these cognitive approaches in ways that had meaning for them. Further, young people's descriptions demonstrated that a flexible approach to treatment was important in terms of allowing clinicians to integrate other techniques (e.g., mindfulness, art therapy, ACT). This highlights the possibility that other therapeutic approaches, or at least elements of them, are engaging and acceptable to young people.</p>
              <p>Depressive symptomology (e.g., lack of motivation) may impact on participants' ability to engage in and retain aspects of CBT. This was observed in subjective reports about lack of motivation, negative view of self and reported cognitive challenges. It may have also impacted on what was often observed as difficulty recalling aspects of the treatment they had received at the time of the trial, although treatment had been at least a year prior for all participants. A lack of motivation may also indicate poor therapeutic engagement and reflect the acceptability of CBT, or therapy generally. Nevertheless, the descriptions of subjective neurocognitive deficits are consistent with developmental stage (Sauter et al., 2009) and prior studies of young people with depression (Allot et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Allott et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Goodall et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Lee et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In particular, a prior qualitative study showed neurocognitive deficits similarly interfered with psychological treatment of depression in youth (Morey‐Nase, <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Neurocognitive deficits are an important area for early intervention in MDD and a key consideration in the delivery of treatment (Allot et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Allott et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Goodall et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Lee et al., <xref rid="eip13290-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>
              <p>Notably, this study was restricted to a help‐seeking population recruited into an RCT, therefore generalizations to other young people with MDD may be limited. As the interviews were conducted between 16 and 31 months after the termination of treatment, it is possible, and indeed the reports of participants revealed it was the case, that participants had challenges recalling details of their experience of CBT. It is a relatively small sample size, largely to do with the time that had passed since the main study so that it was challenging to reengage young people in this secondary study. The study included participants who completed between 3 and 10 sessions, meaning there were a range of experiences; the relationship between the number of sessions and the experience of therapy was not reflected in the narratives. Those receiving fewer sessions may have disengaged because the treatment was unacceptable to them or because they experienced sufficient symptom relief (which they may or may not attribute to therapy). Strengths of this study included that recruitment was from a large geographical area across Melbourne's North‐Western region, increasing external validity. Two investigators analysed the data as it was collected, reflecting on their interpretation given their professional and role in the larger trial.</p>
              <p>Further research could be conducted with participants from naturalistic clinical and community settings (i.e., outside of the clinical trial setting) where therapy is not usually delivered according to a manual. Interviews could also be conducted whilst young people are receiving therapy, or shortly afterwards to ensure recall accuracy. Finally, conducting qualitative research with mental health professionals who have delivered interventions to this cohort may assist in further refining this treatment.</p>
              <p>This qualitative study provides important insights about young people's experience of CBT and has the potential to inform how CBT is delivered. Findings support clinicians having a youth friendly, collaborative and client‐centred approach with this population. This should include ensuring that they are aware of how their client is responding to information and therapeutic interventions as they are delivered throughout the therapeutic process. Participants' descriptions of their experience revealed themes highlighting that CBT has a range of useful skills and techniques that young people can learn in the context of a positive relationship with their clinician. The current study suggests that a modular approach does not have a negative impact but allows clinicians to deliver various components of CBT on the basis the client's presenting issue and formulation, which contributes to ensuring a collaborative approach. Finally, and importantly, there is a need for clinicians to consider how clients' symptoms may impede treatment. In the case of MDD, clinicians must enquire about and be aware of cognitive deficits and adjust therapy accordingly. Continuing to investigate and explore the experiences of young people with MDD is important in order to ensure enhancement of existing treatments.</p>
