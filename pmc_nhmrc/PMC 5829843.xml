                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Excessive and insufficient sun exposure during childhood have been linked to serious diseases in later life; for example, insufficient sun exposure during childhood may increase the risk of developing myopia. The Kidskin-Young Adult Myopia Study (K-YAMS) is a follow-up of participants in the Kidskin Study, a non-randomised controlled trial that evaluated the effect of a 4-year educational intervention on sun-protection behaviours among primary school children in the late 1990s. Children who received the Kidskin intervention had lower levels of sun exposure compared with peers in the control group after 2 and 4 years of the intervention, but this was not maintained 2  years after the intervention had ceased. Thus, a follow-up of Kidskin Study participants provides a novel opportunity to investigate the associations between a childhood sun-exposure intervention and potentially related conditions in adulthood.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The K-YAMS contacts Kidskin Study participants and invites them to participate using a variety of methods, such as prior contact details, the Australian Electoral Roll and social media. Self-reported and objective measures of sun-exposure and sun-protection behaviours are collected as well as a number of eye measurements including cycloplegic autorefraction and ocular biometry. Data will be analysed to investigate a possible association between myopic refractive error and Kidskin intervention group or measured sun exposure.</p>

              <p>Between 1995 and 2001, Western Australian researchers conducted the Kidskin Study, a 6-year non-randomised controlled trial that aimed to ‘design, implement and evaluate an intervention to reduce sun exposure in children’<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and thus reduce the risk of melanoma in later life.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Eligible participants were those attending their first year of schooling in 1995 at a participating school, all of which were located within 30 km of Perth. Of the 2528 children invited to participate in the Kidskin Study, consent was provided by a parent or legal guardian for 1776 participants.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

The Kidskin Study curriculum was designed to be developmentally appropriate and skills-based and included both school-based and home-based activities that were administered in school by the children’s primary school teacher.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In addition to the Kidskin Study curriculum, the high group also received ‘Totally Cool Summer Club’ programme material over the summer holidays and was offered low-cost swimwear that protected the trunk, upper arms and thighs. Schools allocated to the high-intervention group were also given assistance in implementing sun-protection policies.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The control group received the standard Western Australian health education curriculum over the same period.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>

              <p>The primary outcome was change in number of melanocytic naevi on the back at the 4-year follow-up. This was not significantly different between the high, moderate and control groups at the end of intervention (1999) and 2-year postintervention (2001) follow-ups. Analysis of secondary outcomes showed that parents of children in the high group reported that their child experienced less whole body sun exposure than that reported by the parents in the control group at the 2-year and 4-year follow-ups (1997 and 1999).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 14</xref> Parents of children in both intervention groups reported that their children spent less time outside between 11:00 and 14:00 at the 2-year follow-up, but at the 4-year follow-up, only children in the high group had significantly lower reported time spent outdoors between 11:00 and 14:00 compared with the control group.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 14</xref> Measurement of suntan using skin spectrophotometry showed that children in the high and moderate groups had a significantly lower level of suntan at the end of summer than the control group at the 2-year follow-up.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, there was no significant difference at the 4-year and postintervention follow-ups.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The skin spectrophotometer had to be changed between the 2-year and 4-year follow-ups as it became unserviceable, and this change in measurement instrument may be a factor in the lack of an association between measured suntan and intervention group at the later follow-ups.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> At the final Kidskin Study follow-up in 2001, 2 years after the intervention had ceased, there was no significant difference in suntan or sun exposure between children in the high, moderate and control groups with the exception of applying sunscreen to the back, which was more common in the moderate and high groups.</p>
              <p>The size, quality and length of intervention and follow-up of the Kidskin Study make it unique among studies of child and adolescent sun protection. Other sun-protection intervention studies have had mixed results in reducing sun exposure in participants. Studies finding no effect of an intervention, lacking a control group or not longitudinally following the same participants have limited usefulness when investigating the impacts of sun exposure during childhood.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–20</xref> Of the studies that have successfully reduced sun exposure in the intervention group compared with the control group, all have had shorter intervention and follow-up periods than the Kidskin Study.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref></p>
              <p>Hence, the Kidskin Study provides a novel opportunity to investigate the association between sun exposure during childhood and the development of potentially related conditions in adulthood. The intervention study formed a cohort in which particular groups of participants had different levels of sun exposure during a well-defined period in primary school. Additionally, participants had both subjective and objective measurements of sun exposure recorded at multiple time points throughout childhood.</p>
              <p>The Kidskin Study participants are 27–28 years old in 2017—an age when the prevalence of myopia, a disorder that predominantly develops in younger life—has generally stabilised.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The Kidskin Young Adult Myopia Study (K-YAMS) will follow-up participants in the Kidskin Study, to determine the long-term effects on health—particularly eye health—of a sun-protection intervention during childhood.</p>

                <p>The K-YAMS aims to use the established Kidskin Study cohort to investigate the association between the Kidskin intervention and the prevalence of myopia in participants of the Kidskin Study, who are now young adults. Recruitment for the K-YAMS began in May 2015 and will be completed by the end of 2018. All participants of the Kidskin Study are eligible to participate. The expected follow-up sample size (n ~800) is likely to be too small to investigate rarer outcomes such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, but will be large enough to detect differences in relatively common disorders such as myopia.</p>
                <p>While a significant amount of time has passed since the Kidskin participants were last contacted, approximately one-third (n=547) of participants responded to a mail out invitation to provide a saliva sample in 2005; however, since 2001, the majority of the Kidskin participants have not been contacted. We are therefore using a variety of approaches to contact participants including previous address and telephone or mobile phone details from the Kidskin Study, Facebook, the Australian Electoral Roll and snowball recruiting from participants we have been able to contact, asking them to help spread awareness of the K-YAMS to their schoolmates.</p>

Two Metz 36 C-2 flashes (Metz, Zirndorf, Middle Franconia, Germany) with 18A Wratten glass filters fitted over the flash heads are used as the excitation source. Blood is taken by venepuncture into serum separator tubes. One millilitre aliquots of serum are frozen at −40°C until the completion of the study.

                <title>Implications</title>
                <p>Australia has the highest skin cancer incidence in the world; melanoma is the deadliest of the skin cancers and is particularly associated with childhood sun exposure.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Incidence rates of melanoma were rapidly rising in the late 20th century. In the face of this, Australia led the world in developing sun-protection programmes to reduce childhood sun exposure. Encouragingly, the incidence of melanoma in Australia has remained stable since 2006.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> However, recent evidence suggests that there may be beneficial effects of sun exposure, such as preventing onset of myopia, and it is now essential to understand these effects to find a balance between excessive and insufficient sun exposure.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 29</xref> Unfortunately, the impact of childhood sun exposure is difficult to study. First, the effects—both beneficial and detrimental—can take a long time to manifest so that either recall of distant events is required for retrospective studies or long length of follow-up is required for prospective studies. Second, observational studies of sun exposure are unable to attribute observed associations specifically to sun exposure, due to other confounding factors that often accompany sun exposure, such as physical activity. Randomised controlled trials can overcome this issue, but are difficult and costly to run, and can pose ethical dilemmas, for example, where the full effects of an intervention have potential adverse effects on health. In addition, in an intervention study, it may be a long time before the harmful or beneficial effects of the intervention are fully appreciated. The Kidskin Study was a thorough controlled trial that was completed in 1999 and presents a truly unique opportunity to immediately begin studying the effects of an intervention which successfully reduced sun exposure compared with controls. A difference in myopia prevalence across the intervention groups may suggest that the age period over which Kidskin participants received the intervention is a key period in the development of myopia. This age group could then be targeted by public health campaigns aimed at preventing the onset of myopia in at-risk children through a controlled increase in time spent outside. However, the utility of the Kidskin Study cohort is not limited to myopia, and further follow-ups could provide crucial information in examining the effects of reducing childhood sun exposure.</p>
