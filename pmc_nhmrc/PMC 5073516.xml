                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Hypertension is emerging in rural populations of India. Barriers to diagnosis and treatment of hypertension may differ regionally according to economic development. Our main objectives are to estimate the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in 3 diverse regions of rural India; identify barriers to diagnosis and treatment in each setting and evaluate the feasibility of a community-based intervention to improve control of hypertension.</p>

                  <p>This study includes 4 main activities: (1) assessment of risk factors, quality of life, socioeconomic position and barriers to changes in lifestyle behaviours in ∼14 500 participants; (2) focus group discussions with individuals with hypertension and indepth interviews with healthcare providers, to identify barriers to control of hypertension; (3) use of a medicines-availability survey to determine the availability, affordability and accessibility of medicines and (4) trial of an intervention provided by Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), comprising group-based education and support for individuals with hypertension to self-manage blood pressure. Wards/villages/hamlets of a larger Mandal are identified as the primary sampling unit (PSU). PSUs are then randomly selected for inclusion in the cross-sectional survey, with further randomisation to intervention or control. Changes in knowledge of hypertension and risk factors, and clinical and anthropometric measures, are assessed. Evaluation of the intervention by participants provides insight into perceptions of education and support of self-management delivered by the ASHAs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hypertension is the leading contributor to the global burden of disease and mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In 2000, ∼120 million Indians had high blood pressure (BP) and this figure is expected to increase to about 215 million by 2025.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> According to a recent systematic review of hypertension in India, the overall prevalence of hypertension was estimated to be nearly 30%, with a significant difference in the overall pooled prevalence between urban (33.8% (95% CI 29.7% to 37.8%)) and rural (27.6% (95% CI 23.2% to 32.0%)) populations nationally. This disparity was particularly marked in West India (pooled prevalence urban (35.8% (95% CI 35.2% to 36.5%)) and rural (18.1% (95% CI 16.9% to 19.2%))).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> With the rapid urbanisation of India, lifestyle changes, known to be associated with increased risk of hypertension, become more common. These lifestyle changes may be driving the convergence of the prevalence of hypertension between urban and rural India.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Such convergence is observed in the pooled estimates, using random effect analysis, for South India where there were no detectable differences in the prevalence of hypertension between rural and urban populations (urban: 31.5% (95% CI 23.6% to 39.5%) versus rural: 28.3% (95% CI 21.4% to 35.1%), p=0.62).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>Recent observations indicate that only approximately one-quarter of the people with a diagnosis of hypertension in rural Kerala receive treatment and, of this population, only ∼30% has their BP within the therapeutic target<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> (systolic BP (SBP) &lt;140 mm Hg and diastolic BP (DBP) &lt;90 mm Hg).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>There are many different barriers to the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in urban and rural regions. These barriers likely comprise proximate determinants<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and operate at the individual and systems level.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> For example, awareness (diagnosis) of hypertension at the individual level may be influenced by distance to, and usage of, health services, physical inactivity and social factors.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> System level factors, which may influence awareness of hypertension, include the knowledge of risk factors by healthcare workers, availability of equipment for measuring BP and quality, availability and expertise of healthcare providers. Treatment of hypertension is influenced by age, distance to healthcare<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and socioeconomic position (SEP).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> At the system level, treatment may be influenced by knowledge and implementation of current treatment initiation guidelines and availability of medicines.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Control of hypertension is likely influenced individually by adherence to medication, SEP, health literacy and understanding of chronic disease and risk factors for chronic disease such as physical activity and tobacco use.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Within health systems, control of hypertension may be influenced by understanding of treatment guidelines, availability of medication and capacity to monitor and follow-up patients.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>There is also some emerging evidence that system and individual-level barriers may vary according to the stage of epidemiological, demographic and economic transition of different populations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> For example, as the disease patterns in the population change rapidly, training of the health workforce may not be adequately up-to-date and basic diagnostic tools (such as BP machines) may also be lacking. In regions where the demographic and economic transition is more advanced, there is a greater prevalence of hypertension and thus a greater awareness of hypertension-related factors such as obesity and physical inactivity.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In disadvantaged and poverty-stricken communities, where the population has not yet been exposed to economic development, the epidemiological transition is still at an earlier stage.</p>
              <p>Disadvantaged communities still comprise the largest proportion of the population in resource-poor countries, but little is known about the awareness of hypertension or of the individual and system-level barriers to its diagnosis and treatment in these settings. An improved understanding of the awareness of hypertension in such disparate settings and the barriers to prevention, diagnosis and treatment will provide the critical knowledge base needed to overcome these barriers. The aims of this research are, within three diverse rural regions, to (1) estimate the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension; (2) use these baseline data to develop strategies to better manage hypertension in rural communities in India; and (3) evaluate the feasibility of a community-based intervention to improve self-management and control of hypertension.</p>
              <p>The research protocol described herein comprises two phases in each of the three settings, with phase I having three parts:</p>
              <p><italic>Phase I</italic>: Baseline assessment

              <p><italic>Phase II</italic>: A feasibility study of an intervention to improve control of hypertension, developed based on the findings of the cross-sectional survey and qualitative studies. The intervention has two basic components: (1) peer group-based education and support for individuals with hypertension for self-management of BP; and (2) health services and workforce strengthening.</p>

                <title>Ia: Baseline cross-sectional survey</title>
                <p>A cross-sectional survey was initially conducted to quantify the burden and awareness of hypertension and examine how the barriers to diagnosis and management differ between settings. Recruitment for this study started in January 2014 and was completed in December 2015. Approximately 14 500 adults living in the study areas have been selected to provide data for the baseline survey. The role of gender, socioeconomic deprivation and education on the diagnosis and management of hypertension in each of the three rural areas is being explored. The data have been used to design the intervention component of the study.</p>

                  <title>Recruitment to cross-sectional survey</title>
                  <p>Population censuses (specifically completed for this study or existing polling booth registers) at each site were used to randomly select potential participants. In Trivandrum and West Godavari, sampling was stratified by age and sex using this approach. However, due to structural factors related to distance between hamlets and demography, this was not feasible in the Rishi Valley region. Residents of the PSU aged at least 18 years were eligible for recruitment to the cross-sectional survey.</p>
                  <p><italic>Trivandrum</italic><bold><italic>:</italic></bold> Among the 14 districts in Kerala, Trivandrum district was selected based on its proximity to the collaborating institute (Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology). Chirayinkizhu taluk was selected randomly from the four taluks in Trivandrum district. Of the 22 Panchayats (local administrative body in rural areas) within Chirayinkizhu taluk, 10 were randomly selected. From each of the selected Panchayats, one ward (the smallest geographic unit of a Panchayat) was randomly selected. In each ward, using the polling booth list, the total number of individuals was divided into 12 age and sex groups (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64 and 65+). From each group, 30 individuals were randomly selected to get a total sample of 360 in each ward. Thus, 3600 participants were selected in the Trivandrum district to participate in the cross-sectional survey. Additional sampling was conducted (10 from each age and sex band) to replace those participants who had migrated, died or refused to participate.</p>
                  <p><italic>West Godavari</italic><bold><italic>:</italic></bold> A sampling frame was developed by mapping all 17 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) within a 50 km radius around the town of Bhimavaram. We excluded those PHCs participating in other studies conducted by the George Institute and randomly selected 10 of the remaining PHCs. All the villages serviced by each PHC were included in the list. Villages with fewer than 3000 residents were excluded. One village was then randomly selected from each PHC, resulting in inclusion of 10 villages. Mapping all the selected villages enabled generation of an age and sex population list with house addresses. Population lists from the mapping were used to randomly select 4500 individuals over the age of 18 years from each participating village. Additional sampling was conducted to replace those participants who had migrated, died or refused to participate. Sampling was stratified by 12 groups defined by age (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65+) and sex with the goal of including comparable numbers of individuals from each group.</p>
                  <p><italic>Rishi Valley region</italic>: The study population comprised the six villages of the Kurabalakota Mandal in the Chittoor District, Southern AP. These villages comprised 221 hamlets or small habitations.</p>
                  <p>Hamlets were stratified by population size (small, medium and large) and then 139 were randomly selected in accordance with the sampling strategy using computer-generated random numbers (generated at Monash University). This was to ensure sampling of approximately equal numbers of hamlets from each size stratification. Six hamlets were excluded due to migration of population. We also excluded the hamlet in which the Rishi Valley Rural Education Centre was located because the population was largely transient, comprising teachers and students who reside in the hamlet only during school time. A study centre was set up in a communal area of the hamlet convenient for all the residents. All residents aged at least 18 years were invited to participate in the cross-sectional survey. Research officers ensured that all residents were informed of the presence of the study team in the habitation by house-to-house notification and encouragement to attend.</p>

                  <title>Data collection/measurement</title>
                  <p>The instruments and measurements chosen for this project are based on recommendations from the WHO STEP-wise approach to disease surveillance (WHO STEPS)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and other validated tools for quality of life, SEP and barriers to changes in alcohol and tobacco behaviour as listed in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1</xref>. The list of measures comprise (1) basic demographic information, including age, income, gender, marital status, religion, number of children and type of work undertaken; (2) lifestyle-related factors such as physical activity, tobacco use and alcohol consumption, dietary factors, including cooking practices and use of salt, stress and overcrowding; (3) knowledge about hypertension and its risk factors, awareness of hypertensive status and reports of the timing and outcome of prior BP measurements; and (4) further details about the use of medications (allopathic and AYUSH or other traditional therapies), barriers to treatment, including access, cost, adoption of lifestyle factors and compliance with medication use (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1</xref> for full list of variables). Questionnaires were developed in English and then translated into the site-specific language (Telugu (AP), Malayalam (Kerala)) and back translated to detect and correct errors.</p>
                  <p>Standardised clinical measurements are collected as follows; arterial BP and heart rate are measured after the participant has sat quietly for at least 15 min. BP is measured at least three times at 3 min intervals using the appropriate cuff size and a Digital Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor (OMRON HEM-907, OMRON Healthcare Company, Kyoto, Japan) according to the WHO STEPS protocol, modified only by using the right arm for all measurements.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Measurement continues until two consecutive readings differ by &lt;10 mm Hg systolic and &lt;6 mm Hg diastolic, with a maximum of five measurements. The mean of the last two consecutive measurements are used to define hypertensive status. Height is measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer (213, Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight is measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a portable digital weighing scale (9000SV3R, Salter, Kent, UK). Waist and hip circumference is measured using a spring-loaded tension tape (Gulick M-22C, Patterson Medical, Illinois, USA) in a private setting. In accordance with the WHO STEPS protocol,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> waist circumference is measured at the midpoint between the lowest rib and upper point of the iliac crest and at the end of normal expiration and hip circumference is measured at the maximum protrusion of the buttocks.</p>
                  <p>To ensure standardisation, data collectors are trained in collection of anthropometric and BP measurements in accordance with the WHO STEPS protocol.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This training, conducted by the project manager for at least 5 days, is to ensure consistency of data collection between sites. Training is provided in a similar manner to ensure that questionnaire administration is also consistent across all sites. A study-specific training manual containing step-by-step procedures for all data collection (anthropometric and survey administration) is provided to each data collector. Data collection at each site is further monitored by site supervisors.

Specifically for the Trivandrum region, 2 of 10 wards are allocated to the intervention and 4 of 10 wards are allocated to the control condition. For the West Godavari region, 2 of 10 villages are allocated to the intervention and 4 of 10 villages are allocated to the control condition. For the Rishi Valley region, hamlets in one of six villages are allocated to the intervention and hamlets in two of six villages to the control condition.</p>
                <p>Allocation of only a subset of the initial PSUs was necessary due to budgetary and programme timeline constraints. Random allocation of the PSUs to intervention or non-intervention conditions is undertaken by the principal investigator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012404F1">figure 1</xref>). As this is a feasibility study, the sample size for those receiving the intervention is not powered to determine effectiveness. However, changes in individual measurements over time are assessed. The intervention addresses those factors that are identified during the qualitative and cross-sectional studies which contribute to control of hypertension in these settings and includes management and control strategies aimed at the individual, health service delivery and policy levels.</p>

ASHAs are female lay health workers, residing in each village, most of whom have completed secondary schooling. Their work accountability primarily lies within the purview of the Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC) which is a committee formed at the revenue village level and acts as a subcommittee of Gram Panchayat.

                  <p>Content for the intervention components was driven by preliminary analysis of the cross-sectional data which reflected poor knowledge of hypertension. Furthermore, principles of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) as described by Lorig <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and found to significantly contribute to improved self-management, were incorporated into the programme content.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Content includes strategies to increase knowledge and understanding of the disease, promote healthy behaviour change and clinical interaction through goal setting.

Additionally, ASHAs are trained to deliver the educational material regarding hypertension and self-management using pictorial flip-chart resources developed for the intervention. ASHAs are also trained to initiate and support self-management of hypertension by the participants through goal-setting.

Additional activities by the ASHA to extend the healthy behaviour messages, such as tobacco cessation and physical activity, as well as behaviours specific to the management of hypertension from the meeting to the wider community by the ASHAs is also measured categorically (Yes/No). This measure captures support/interactions of ASHAs with meeting participants outside the meeting and their discussions of the meeting content with other members of the community and/or with community leaders or health service members.</p>
                    <p>Members of the research team also complete a report after each meeting to provide further information about the meeting activities and detail the shared experiences or difficulties of the participants in managing their hypertension or achieving their goals (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S5</xref>). These reports are used to assess the fidelity of the implementation of the intervention to the protocol.</p>
                    <p><italic>System outcomes of the programme</italic> are obtained via surveys of ASHAs at the end of the intervention (and compared with surveys conducted at the initiation of the intervention) to assess changes in knowledge of ASHAs (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S5</xref>). We also assess the integration or engagement of health providers in the programme by assessing their participation during the intervention. Furthermore, participants provide information about other providers of assistance and information/advice (healthcare team and family/friends/community) and assess meeting activities (goal setting, attendance, problem solving) for delivering self-management support. The overall response rate (people with hypertension in the cross-sectional survey, number consented to participate in meetings) is calculated and participants who discontinue the programme are asked to complete a programme evaluation form and to undertake final measurements at the end of the intervention.</p>

                <p>Analysis will be based on intention to treat. For individual outcomes, proportions will be compared using χ<sup>2</sup> test and continuous measures will be compared using Student's unpaired t-test. Univariable analysis will also be undertaken using logistic and linear regression. Multivariable analyses will be adjusted for age, sex and study site. Considering the unequal distribution of age and sex in the participating population, appropriate sampling weights will be applied to all data analyses.</p>
                <p>Knowledge/awareness of the presence of hypertension and about risk factors will be calculated using the known (and measured) prevalence of hypertension in each population. Between-group differences in knowledge, previous measurement of hypertension and barriers to treatment and their change over time will be compared using χ<sup>2</sup>. Logistic regression (appropriate for the binary outcome variable of the presence/absence of BP≥140/90 mm Hg) will be used to study the factors associated with control of hypertension. Those factors identified as either potentially significant (p&lt;0.20) or biologically relevant will then be introduced into multivariable regression analyses in a backward stepwise fashion to construct a predictive model for good management of hypertension. This technique enables the assessment of categorical variables (eg, gender) as well as continuous variables (eg, age). The scales of the continuous covariates will be checked for suitability using fractional polynomial plots. Collinearity between variables will be evaluated using partial correlations. In addition, routine diagnostic tests (Hosmer-Lemeshow test) will be used to validate the fitted model. We will test efficacy of the intervention by analysis of covariance. This allows us to adjust for baseline differences between groups.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Comprehensive assessment of the barriers to control of hypertension across three diverse settings will provide important information about the diversity of barriers to care across these settings and how these might most appropriately be addressed in the future. Development of an intervention programme, based on the individual and system barriers identified and tailored to the specific needs of each area included in the study, may provide a solution to address the current deficiencies in managing hypertension across rural regions. We will also be able to determine the feasibility of using ASHAs to deliver a community group-based self-management programme for management of hypertension. Task shifting disease management and control from physicians to non-physician health workers is increasingly being explored as a possible solution for populations with limited access to healthcare. In a systematic review of task shifting for NCD management in low and middle-income countries, Joshi <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> suggest that the use of non-physician health workers may be effective and additionally be cost-effective. There are mixed results for the effectiveness of community health workers (CHWs) in identification and management of cardiovascular disease in various settings in India.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Further trials to assess the effectiveness of CHWs in the management of cardiovascular risk factors are currently underway.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Neither of these trials are testing the exclusive use of ASHAs in specifically delivering hypertension self-management education and monitoring. However, these trials, along with ours, will provide valuable evidence which may encourage the government to fund ASHAs to manage NCDs or to identify a new cadre of village health workers to work in the area of NCDs. Since ASHAs are employed in most rural regions, the programme is more likely to be scalable across rural India. This information will also contribute to disease prevention at a global level as the lessons learnt could be suitably adapted across other similar settings.</p>
              <sec id="s4a">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>A limitation to this study is that the training programme delivered to ASHAs has not been formally tested. This may limit the efficacy of the intervention. However, after seeking input from ASHAs involved in the pilot training, we were able to make important refinements to the ASHA training booklet and the educational resources for participants. We also assessed the ASHAs skills in measuring anthropometry and BP, as well as their knowledge of hypertension and NCDs before and after the formal training period as well as at the end of the intervention. This will enable us to determine the competencies of the ASHAs.</p>
                <p>There are also a number of strengths to this study. First, this is a large community-based study in three economically and developmentally diverse rural populations in Southern India, with detailed data on demographics; lifestyle-related factors, including physical activity, tobacco use and alcohol consumption; dietary factors, including cooking practices and use of salt; stress and overcrowding. Second, there is detailed knowledge about hypertension and its risk factors, awareness of hypertensive status and further details about the use of medications, barriers to treatment, including access, cost, adoption of lifestyle factors and compliance with medication use. Such a rich data set will enable detailed exploration of associations between hypertension and economic and epidemiological transition. Furthermore, the additional qualitative studies, including the medicines availability survey, indepth interviews and focus group discussions, will allow us to triangulate potential barriers to diagnosis, treatment and control of hypertension. Data are collected using validated and standardised tools which will allow comparisons with other studies in India and other LMICs.</p>
                <p>Finally, the feasibility study of employing ASHAs in community-based activities to prevent and manage hypertension will add to the increasing body of evidence for using non-physician health workers in the detection and management of NCDs, particularly in LMICs.</p>
