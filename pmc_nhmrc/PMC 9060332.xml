                <p>The Applying <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) trial was a parallel cluster randomised trial that demonstrated <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel) introgression into <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> populations reduced dengue incidence. In this predefined substudy, we compared between treatment arms, the relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> before, during and after <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-introgression. Between March 2015 and March 2020, 60,084 BG trap collections yielded 478,254 <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> and 17,623 <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic>. Between treatment arms there was no measurable difference in <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> relative abundance before or after <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-deployments, with a count ratio of 0.96 (95% CI 0.76, 1.21) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.85, 1.17) respectively. More <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> were caught per trap per week in the <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-intervention arm compared to the control arm during <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel deployments (count ratio 1.23 (95% CI 1.03, 1.46)). Between treatment arms there was no measurable difference in the <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> population size before, during or after <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-deployment (overall count ratio 1.10 (95% CI 0.89, 1.35)). We also compared insecticide resistance phenotypes of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> in the first and second years after <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-deployments. <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> field populations from <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-treated and untreated arms were similarly resistant to malathion (0.8%), permethrin (1.25%) and cyfluthrin (0.15%) in year 1 and year 2 of the trial. In summary, we found no between-arm differences in the relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> prior to or after <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel introgression, and no between-arm difference in <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> insecticide resistance phenotypes. These data suggest neither <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> abundance, nor insecticide resistance, confounded the epidemiological outcomes of the AWED trial.</p>

                <p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease and a major public health problem in the tropical and subtropical world. It is caused by any of the four dengue virus serotypes. In a previously published randomised clinical trial, called the AWED trial, we demonstrated that releases of <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes infected with the insect bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> can reduce the case incidence of dengue by 77%. In this current study, we compared the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in the neighbourhoods where <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes were released versus the untreated neighbourhoods. This was important to do so that scientists could understand the mechanism for how <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> releases reduced dengue incidence. Between March 2015 and March 2020, we did not observe any differences in <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> abundance before or after <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic>-deployments in the AWED trial area. There was also no difference in the abundance of the related mosquito, <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic>, before, during or after <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-deployment. We also compared insecticide resistance characteristics amongst <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> in the first and second years after <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> -deployments and found no difference between mosquitoes from <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic>-treated and untreated neighbourhoods. These data suggest neither <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> abundance, nor insecticide resistance, were confounding sources to the epidemiological outcomes of the AWED trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral infection worldwide and is caused by any of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are the primary vectors of dengue viruses between humans. An estimated 4 billion people in 128 countries are at risk from local DENV transmission and the geographic range and disease burden have expanded substantially in the past 50 years [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> bacteria are endosymbionts of insects that are present in several mosquito species including <italic toggle="yes">Aedes albopictus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Culex pipiens</italic>, but not in <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> stably transinfected with the <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> strain <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel possess three traits that make them attractive as a public health intervention against dengue and other medically important arboviruses. First, <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel infection renders <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> resistant to disseminated infection by dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Second, female mosquitoes vertically transmit <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel with high fidelity to their offspring, thus ensuring population-level <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> establishment persists for many years [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Third, <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel manipulates mosquito reproductive outcomes, a process called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), to favour its own population introgression [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Combined, these traits enable the application of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel as a public health intervention to reduce the vectorial capacity of mosquito populations to transmit DENV between humans.</p>
              <p>The Applying <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) cluster randomised trial introgressed <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel into the <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> population in 12 geographic clusters in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Over 27 months, the incidence of virologically-confirmed dengue was reduced by 77% and the incidence of dengue hospitalisations by 86% when compared to untreated (control) clusters [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The most parsimonious explanation for the reduction in dengue incidence in the <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel introgressed clusters is the reduced vector competence of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-infected mosquito population. However, it’s plausible that <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel introgression had other effects on the <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> population in Yogyakarta that contributed to these epidemiological outcomes. For example, <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-infection decreases the survivorship of mosquito eggs [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and this could plausibly result in a smaller <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> population size in geographic clusters where <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel was introgressed. Periods of self-incompatibility represent another route to a smaller <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> population size—this could occur if maternal transmission of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel was periodically imperfect or CI transiently broke down [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, insecticide resistance characteristics in the <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-infected mosquito population might change over time compared to wild-type mosquitoes in control clusters because of differences in selective pressure from insecticide use in the community.</p>
              <p>Here we report longitudinal comparisons of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> relative abundance and insecticide resistance characteristics between <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-intervention clusters and control clusters. We also report on the relative abundance and distribution of the secondary vector <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> between intervention clusters and control clusters. These comparisons were prespecified secondary endpoints in the AWED protocol [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>The AWED study was a parallel two-arm non-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in a single site in Yogyakarta City, Indonesia. The 26km<sup>2</sup> study site with a population of 312,000 people was subdivided into twenty-four contiguous clusters approximately 1km<sup>2</sup> in size (range 0.7km<sup>2</sup>-1.65km<sup>2</sup>). Twelve clusters were randomly selected to receive <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> deployments and 12 were untreated. There are no buffer areas between clusters, but natural borders (roads, rivers, non-residential areas) were used to define cluster boundaries as much as possible, to limit the spatial spread of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel from treated clusters into untreated areas, and of wild-type mosquitoes into <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-treated clusters. No attempt was made to alter the routine dengue prevention and vector control activities conducted by public and private agencies throughout the study area (treated and untreated clusters).</p>

Releases occurred between March and December 2017, with 9–14 rounds of releases in each intervention cluster. Releases stopped in each cluster when the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> in field-caught mosquitoes was &gt;60% for three consecutive release weeks. MRCs were reset every two weeks. An MRC was placed in 1–2 randomly selected locations within each 50x50m grid square across the intervention area. Permission was obtained from property owners to place MRCs on private property.</p>

                <title>Mosquito surveillance</title>
                <p>Weekly surveillance of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> in Yogyakarta commenced in March 2015, two years prior to the AWED trial releases, and continued until the trial’s conclusion in March 2020. Mosquitoes were collected using a network of BG Sentinel traps (Biogents, Germany) set indoors in residences throughout the city. Each trap was equipped with an accumulator to sustain power in case of a power outage. Written consent was obtained from heads of households hosting BG traps. The BG trap network had three temporal windows; the pre-release period, the release period during which <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel mosquitoes were released and the post-release period. For reasons related to budget and workforce capacity, it was not possible to keep the BG trap density constant between each phase but we did ensure balance between treatment arms for the great majority of the 5-year observation period. The median trapping density in the pre-release period March 2015—February 2017 was 3.5 traps/km<sup>2</sup> (range 0.9 to 23.3) in the intervention clusters and 5.2 traps/km<sup>2</sup> (range 0.6 to 6.8) in the untreated clusters. During the <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel release period March—December 2017, the median trapping density in the intervention clusters was increased to 15.7 traps/km<sup>2</sup> (range 10.2 to 18.2). For the first seven weeks of releases the trapping density in the untreated clusters remained the same (median trapping density 5.2 traps/km<sup>2</sup> [range 0.9 to 6.3]), followed by no trapping for two weeks. From May 2017 the number of traps in the untreated clusters was increased for the remainder of the release period to a median of 14.8 traps/km<sup>2</sup> (range 5.9 to 16.8). In the post-intervention period January 2018—March 2020, a fixed spatial distribution of BG traps, with comparable density between study arms, was maintained. The median was 15.9 traps/km<sup>2</sup> (range 12.3 to 18.1) in the intervention clusters and 14.8 traps/km<sup>2</sup> (range 8.0 to 16.8) in the untreated clusters; the median (range) distance of traps from the cluster boundary was 68 (42–102) metres in the intervention clusters and 68 (32–84) metres in untreated clusters; and the median (range) of the average distance to the nearest trap was 211 (185–239) metres in intervention clusters and 225 (203–280) metres in untreated clusters. The median (range) nearest neighbour index was 1.6 (1.4–1.9) in the intervention clusters and 1.7 (1.5–1.9) in the untreated clusters, where a value of &lt;1 indicates a clustered pattern and &gt;1 indicates a dispersed pattern. The post-intervention BG trap distribution per cluster is shown in <xref rid="pntd.0010284.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> and tabulated in <xref rid="pntd.0010284.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p>
                <p>Mosquitoes captured in BG traps were demobilised at -20°C for ≥1 hour, then identified by morphological features. The number of mosquitoes caught in each BG trap was recorded by species and sex. <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> were stored at -20°C in 80% ethanol until testing for <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel infection. Individual whole mosquitoes were homogenised in 96 well plates using 1mm glass beads and a bead beater. After centrifugation, an aliquot of the homogenate supernatant was used for detection of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> by qualitative PCR Taqman assay on a Roche LightCycler 480. The qPCR conditions consisted of a denaturation step at 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 45 cycles of PCR (denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 15 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 1 second with the single acquisition) followed by a cooling down step at 40°C for 10 seconds. Specific primers targeting the gene encoding <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti Rps17</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel <italic toggle="yes">WD0513</italic> were used as previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but with replacement of the Cy5-BHQ3 fluorophore-quencher pair in the <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel probe with the fluorophore-quencher LC640-IowaBlack (Integrated DNA technologies) [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Testing was at weekly intervals when <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> prevalence was &lt;80% and 4-week intervals when establishment was achieved (≥80% cluster level prevalence for two consecutive testing weeks).</p>

                <title>Insecticide resistance testing</title>
                <p>Insecticide resistance testing by bioassay was performed in 2018 and 2019 on field-derived adults sourced from each of the 24 clusters. Each cluster generated a cohort of mosquitoes that was tested for insecticide resistance, thus there were 12 cohorts from <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-treated clusters and 12 from untreated clusters each year, with the exception of 2018 when there were 11 cohorts from <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-treated clusters. Cyfluthrin and malathion were chosen for testing on the basis of their use in fine aerosol (fogging) spraying by the Yogyakarta Department of Health in response to dengue cases in the community. Permethrin was included on the basis of it being representative of pyrethroids commonly found in household insecticide sprays. Mosquito eggs were collected using ovitraps from in and around residential properties that hosted BG traps for <italic toggle="yes">Wolbachia</italic> monitoring. To maximise the probability that ovitraps were attracting only the desired populations of mosquitoes (i.e. 100% <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel infected or 100% wild-type) they were placed in properties where recent BG trap surveillance indicated 0% <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel prevalence (in untreated clusters) or 100% <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel prevalence (in intervention clusters). In 2018, a total of 346 ovitraps were deployed in BG host houses for egg collection over three weeks. In 2019, a total of 345 ovitraps were deployed in BG host houses and 370 in a neighbouring house for egg collection over two weeks. Neighbouring houses were added in 2019 to boost egg collection as there was some difficulty in getting sufficient eggs from only BG host houses in 2018. In 2018 egg collections were performed in June-July and in 2019 collections were performed in September. Eggs were dried for 1 day, stored, and hatched when required. Eggs from the same cluster were pooled before hatching. <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were visually identified and selected during the larval stage. Female <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were selected at the pupal stage. In 2018, F0 mosquitoes (i.e. the adults derived from field collected eggs) were used directly for insecticide resistance testing. In 2019, F1 adults (i.e. the offspring of F0 adults) were used for insecticide resistance testing. The move to using F1 adults was to reduce the resource-intensive collection of sufficient eggs from the field. Insecticide type and concentrations used were in line with recommendations for <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and followed the WHO standard bioassay method, noting that this method is only semi-quantitative [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Insecticide impregnated papers were purchased from the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia. The papers used were Malathion 0.8%, Permethrin 1.25%, and Cyfluthrin 0.15%. Pyrethroid control paper was used for Permethrin and Cyfluthrin, and OP-Carbamate control was used for Malathion. In each year, six rounds of insecticide resistance testing were conducted, with two intervention clusters and two untreated clusters randomly allocated to each round. The first three testing rounds in 2018 (covering 12 clusters) included four replication tubes for each insecticide and two negative control tubes, with 25 female <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> mosquitoes per tube. The mosquitoes were three to five days old, fed with sugar only. Mosquitoes were kept in a paper-free tube for one hour to adapt, transferred to the tube containing insecticide-impregnated paper for one hour, then transferred back to the holding tube, with access to sugar solution, for 24 hours. Dead and live mosquitoes were counted after 24 hours. The Rockefeller <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> strain was used as a susceptible control line in the 2019 experiments.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The number of mosquitoes caught over time was summarised as the mean count per BG trap per week, by species and study arm (<xref rid="pntd.0010284.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>). The ratio of female to male <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> over time was calculated on the basis of summed weekly counts and stratified by study arm. The ratio of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> mosquitoes over time was also calculated on the basis of summed weekly counts and stratified by study arm.</p>
                <p>Mixed-effects negative binomial regression was used to compare the number of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> caught per trap per week in the intervention arm versus the untreated arm, with the inclusion of BG trap as a random effect to account for clustering at the trap level. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to compare the number of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> caught per trap per week in the intervention arm compared to the untreated arm, with a clustered sandwich estimator to control for clustering at the trap level. A zero-inflated model was used as &gt;80% of trap collections had zero <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic>. All analyses included a binary indicator for dry/wet season as a covariate (wet season = November—April). The count ratio produced by the negative binomial regression model is the ratio of the mean number of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> mosquitoes caught per trap per week in the intervention clusters compared to the untreated clusters. Data was analysed for the total observation period as well as separated by release status: pre-<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel release, during release, and post-<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel release, as defined earlier. Analysis of the total observation period was done with the inclusion of an indicator for release status as a covariate. The first nine weeks of releases were excluded from all analyses due to unequal trapping density by study arm and concerns that lower trapping density in the untreated clusters could result in less precise estimates of mosquito abundance compared to the intervention clusters.</p>
                <p>Insecticide resistance was expressed as percentage mortality of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> exposed to various insecticides, calculated as the number of dead mosquitoes divided by the total number of mosquitoes in each replicate tube. The cluster-level percentage mortality is then the mean percentage mortality of the 4 replicate tubes in each cluster. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the distribution of percentage mortality among 12 intervention clusters and 12 untreated clusters. Analysis was done separately for 2018 and 2019. One cluster from the intervention arm was excluded from analysis in 2018 due to low mosquito hatching rates resulting in insufficient mosquitoes for analysis.</p>

                <p>Power to detect a difference in mosquito abundance between <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel intervention and untreated arms was calculated using a simulation with 1,000 repeats of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> monitoring data from the pre-<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel release period. For each simulation, 50% of all BG traps were randomly assigned to the intervention arm and 50% to the untreated arm.

A mixed-effect negative binomial regression was used to calculate the test statistic and p-value. The estimated power to detect a given effect size was determined as the proportion of observations (out of 1,000) for which the p-value was &lt;0.05. The simulation indicated that we have 80% power to detect a difference in the number of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> of ≥20% between study arms, and 90% power to detect a difference of ≥23%.</p>

              <p>The AWED trial previously reported a 77% (95% CI 65, 85%) reduction in the incidence of virologically-confirmed dengue, and an 86% (95% CI, 66.2 to 94.3) reduction in dengue hospitalisations, in <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-intervention versus control clusters [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The reduced vector competence of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel intervention clusters is the simplest explanation for the epidemiological findings in the AWED trial but it was important to consider other possibilities. The results reported here provide evidence that the trial’s epidemiological findings were likely not confounded by differences in <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> adult abundance or insecticide resistance characteristics between the two study arms. Additionally, the relatively low abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic>, and the balance in numbers between study arms, suggests the trial outcomes were also not confounded by this secondary vector.</p>
              <p>A body of literature, albeit mostly from laboratory studies, has described <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-infection as having negligible or small fitness costs in one or more mosquito life history traits. For example, in laboratory conditions Walker <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> described no impact of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel on adult fecundity, egg survivorship or larval development time, but did report reduced (~10%) adult female survivorship times compared to controls [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Conversely, Fraser <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] described no impact of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel on adult longevity but did find egg survival times were slightly reduced compared to wild-type counterparts. Ross <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported that <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-infection reduced larval survival by ~15% under strict starvation conditions that pressure tested the nutritional reserves of instar first and second larval instars [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Using field-derived adult mosquitoes, Hoffmann <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> measured ~25% lower fecundity and larvae production from <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-infected females when compared to wild-type counterparts [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In Brazil, Farnesi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel infection delayed embryogenesis, decreased desiccation resistance through delayed eggshell formation and eggs had substantially lower survivorship after 6 weeks storage compared to uninfected control mosquitoes. Why then did we find no differences in the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> adults in intervention clusters versus control clusters? One possible explanation is that the collective fitness costs of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel in the field are too small to manifest as a measurable difference in <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> counts between treatment arms, despite 60,084 BG trap collections and 478,254 <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> caught. Our power estimates suggested 80% power to detect a 20% difference or greater in the number of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> between <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel intervention and control clusters, suggesting that if there is a true difference in relative abundance it is probably smaller than 20%.</p>
              <p>Globally, <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> is considered a secondary vector of dengue relative to <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic>. In Yogyakarta, <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> was far more prevalent than <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> in the BG trap network in all 24 trial clusters and there was no difference in <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> abundance between study arms. This is encouraging from the perspective that <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel introgression into <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> did not lead to any measurable alteration in the ecological balance between the two species that might inadvertently allow <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> to expand its population size in Yogyakarta. The much lower abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> relative to <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> is partly explained by Yogyakarta being mostly a highly urbanised environment that favours <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti’s</italic> domesticated lifestyle. The role of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> in the epidemiology of dengue in Yogyakarta is unclear. Going forward, it will be important to explore the relative contributions of <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> versus <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel-infected <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> in any ongoing dengue transmission that occurs in Yogyakarta after city-wide <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel introgression is completed in 2021.</p>
              <p>In Indonesia, organophosphates (temephos and malathion) and pyrethroids are the two major classes of insecticide utilized for <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> control. Cyfluthrin (a pyrethroid) and malathion are used by Yogyakarta authorities in fogging activities in response to dengue cases in the community. Resistance to pyrethroids was documented in <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> from Yogyakarta City in 2015 [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To help ensure the competitiveness of the <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel release material deployed in the AWED trial the insecticide resistance profile of the mosquito line was matched to the wild-type field population by repeated outcrossing with wild-type mosquitoes from Yogyakarta City [<xref rid="pntd.0010284.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It was reassuring therefore that we found equivalent insecticide resistance profiles between cohorts of mosquitoes from the <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel treated clusters versus the untreated clusters in 2018 and again in 2019. This provides evidence that the release material used in 2017 was suitably matched to the local insecticide resistance profile. It also provides further reassurance that the epidemiological effect measured in the AWED trial was not confounded by a difference in the sensitivity of mosquitoes to insecticides between the two study arms. We note however that WHO insecticide resistance bioassays are semi-quantitative in nature and that small differences in absolute insecticide resistance are difficult to measure. It will be of great interest to track the insecticide resistance profile of the <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> in Yogyakarta over coming years. One hypothesis is that dengue case incidence will be very low in Yogyakarta after city-wide establishment of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel and that this will significantly decrease insecticide fogging episodes carried out by local authorities. In turn, this diminished selective pressure might lead to a degree of restoration of insecticide susceptibility in the mosquito population.</p>
              <p>Our study had some limitations. We did not measure variables such as household-level insecticide usage or local community behaviours that might have been confounding to the trial results, though we think that randomisation will have balanced these parameters. Our methods of mosquito surveillance (BG traps located predominantly indoors) were plausibly biased to detecting <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> rather than <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic>. Indeed, <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">albopictus</italic> should be taken into consideration when interpreting dengue epidemiology in Yogyakarta from 2021 onwards.</p>
              <p>Collectively, the results here suggest <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel introgression to a high and stable prevalence had no measurable impact on adult <italic toggle="yes">Ae</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aegypti</italic> population size or insecticide resistance phenotype. The results will be reassuring to audiences concerned about ecological impacts of <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel introgression. More generally, we’d expect the <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>Mel introgression method to deliver similar positive public health benefits and the same unremarkable entomological outcomes in other dengue-endemic urban settings in Indonesia.</p>
