                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Interventions addressing the individual and environmental protective factors of adolescents are suggested to have potential for reducing adolescent substance use. While universally delivered school-based substance use prevention interventions are common, previous studies have suggested variable effectiveness by subgroups of students. An exploratory study was undertaken to examine the differential effectiveness of a universal school-based resilience intervention on adolescent substance use and protective factors according to their sociodemographic and previous substance use.</p>

                  <p>Cohort of grade 7 students (n=3155) followed up in grade 10 (aged 15–16 years; 2014; n=2105).</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>Three-year universal school-based intervention implemented by school staff that targeted a range of student resilience protective factors (2012–2014).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Measurements</title>
                  <p>Primary outcomes included: tobacco (recent, number of cigarettes) and alcohol (recent, ‘risk’ and number of drinks) use, and secondary outcomes included: marijuana (recent) and other illicit substance (recent) use, and aggregate individual and environmental protective factor scores. Generalised and linear mixed models examined interactions between treatment and student subgroups (gender; socioeconomic disadvantage (low/high); geographic location (major city/inner regional/outer regional-remote); and previous substance use (non-user/user)) at follow-up (36 models).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Analysis of student follow-up data showed no differential intervention effect for any substance use or protective factor outcome for any subgroup, with the exception of one differential effect found by socioeconomic status for the outcome of mean number of cigarettes smoked by recent smokers (p=0.003). There was no evidence of an intervention effect within the low (mean difference (MD) −12.89, 95% CI −26.00 to 0.23) or high (MD 16.36, 95% CI −1.03 to 33.76) socioeconomic subgroups.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>No evidence of an intervention effect on substance use and protective factors was found according to student subgroups defined by sociodemographic characteristics or previous substance use.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Initiation of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use in high-income countries generally occurs during adolescence,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> with earlier use associated with greater dependence in adulthood and a range of negative health outcomes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite declining trends in adolescent use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substances internationally,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5</xref> a considerable proportion of adolescents from high-income countries continue to report such use: 23%<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and 45%<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> having smoked a cigarette, 43%<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and 71%<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> having consumed an alcoholic drink and 15%<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and 40%<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> having used an illicit substance.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5 6</xref> Similar levels of adolescent substance use are reported in Australia, with 19%,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> 68%<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and 16%<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> of adolescents respectively reporting having ever smoked a cigarette, had an alcoholic drink or used an illicit substance. Additionally within Australia, the prevalence of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use is reported to differ by gender,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> socioeconomic disadvantage<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and geographic location.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Evidence from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggests that a range of individual and environmental factors are associated with a decreased likelihood, and considered protective factors, of adolescent tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–22</xref> Individual factors found to be associated with a decreased likelihood of adolescent substance use include self-efficacy, problem solving and self-awareness, whereas environmental factors include caring relationships with adults and peers, and meaningful participation in home, school and community settings.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–22</xref> These protective factors are also sometimes described as contributing to ‘resilience’.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref> Most broadly, resilience has been defined as a ‘process, capacity or outcome of successfully adapting to challenging or threatening circumstances’.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In disadvantaged populations in particular, ‘resilience’ or the presence of these protective factors has been found to characterise students with good health and life outcomes despite greater risk status.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This is consistent with meta-analysis results from a recent systematic review that reported universal school-based interventions that address individual and environmental resilience protective factors to be effective in reducing illicit substance use by adolescents.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Only one controlled trial has examined the effectiveness of an intervention approach focused solely on resilience protective factors in reducing adolescent substance use.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> While the study reported significant results for tobacco midintervention, no effect on tobacco, alcohol or marijuana use outcomes were evident at follow-up.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In contrast, a non-controlled pre-post study of a 3-year universal intervention focused solely on individual and environmental protective factors reported significant reductions in the use of tobacco (50% to 27%), alcohol (34% to 17%) and marijuana (16% to 7%) use among cross-sections of students.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Such evidence suggests the potential of school-based resilience interventions that address these individual and environmental protective factors as a means to reducing adolescent substance use.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11–22</xref></p>
              <p>School-based substance use prevention interventions that are delivered to all students in a school or classroom regardless of risk; that is, universal interventions,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> are recommended and commonly implemented by governments worldwide.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33–36</xref> It has however been suggested that not all students within a population may benefit equally from universally implemented substance use prevention interventions, with certain subgroups of students either benefiting more or less than others.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> As a result, investigation of the generalisability of universal substance use intervention effects across subgroups of students has been recommended.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> This recommendation is consistent with the standards of evidence for effective programmes and policies developed by the Society for Prevention Research.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> For interventions found to be effective overall, investigation of the generalisability of effect across subgroups provides guidance for how to enhance intervention effectiveness for all student subgroups. For interventions that have a null effect overall, such investigation can provide guidance to hypothesise whether an intervention may be effective for particular subgroups and identify opportunities for future studies to test such hypotheses.</p>
              <p>The only universally implemented school-based intervention focused solely on targeting resilience protective factors has not investigated any variable patterns of effect by participant subgroups. However, of those studies that have implemented school-based interventions that address resilience protective factors among other factors as part of a broader intervention approach, a variable pattern of effect by participant subgroup has been reported. Such variability has been reported to occur between students defined by sociodemographic and previous substance use characteristics.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40–43</xref> For example, studies have reported differential intervention effects on tobacco use by gender, such as reductions in tobacco use for either females<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> or males,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref> whereas other studies have reported differential effects by socioeconomic level, such as reductions in alcohol use for students of low socioeconomic schools but no effect in schools of medium or high socioeconomic level.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> No universally delivered school-based studies addressing protective factors could be found that examined differential intervention effects by subgroups of students defined by geographic location. Previous studies have also examined differential effectiveness of school-based substance use interventions in terms of students classified by risk of substance use, most often defined as substance use initiation prior to intervention. Such studies report mixed results,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> suggesting such interventions are more effective for existing substance users than non-users, more effective for existing non-users than users or no differential effect according to previous substance use.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 44–46</xref></p>
              <p>A cluster-randomised control study was undertaken to investigate the overall effectiveness of a universally delivered school-based resilience intervention in reducing substance use by adolescents (20 intervention; 12 control schools).<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> As previously reported, the study found no effect on the primary (tobacco and alcohol use; mental health problems) or secondary (illicit substance use, individual and environmental resilience protective factors) student outcomes. The study also investigated the effect of the intervention on the implementation of resilience intervention strategies in both intervention and control schools, and of the 16 outcomes related to the implementation of resilience strategies, intervention schools were more likely than control schools to implement 9 hours of resilience curriculum.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref> In order to investigate whether any student subgroups benefited from the intervention, a study was conducted to examine the differential effectiveness of the universally delivered school-based ‘resilience’ protective factor intervention on substance use by adolescents according to their sociodemographic and previous substance use characteristics. A secondary aim was to examine the differential effectiveness of the intervention on the hypothesised mechanism of effect, student resilience protective factors.</p>

                <p>A 3-year universal (‘whole of school’) intervention was delivered by school staff to all students in the cohort during grades 8–10. The intervention, based on a pilot study,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> involved 16 broad strategy areas (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>) seeking to build the protective factors of students implemented across all three domains of the Health Promoting Schools framework<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>). Each broad intervention strategy addressed at least one individual (self-efficacy, problem solving, cooperation/communication, self-awareness, empathy and goals/aspirations) or environmental protective factor (school support, school meaningful participation, community support, community meaningful participation, home support, home meaningful participation, peer-caring relationships and prosocial peers). Such protective factors align with a ‘resilience’ approach.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–25 56</xref> Schools were provided with details of existing available resources and programmes targeting the protective factors identified by researchers.

All models included a fixed effect for treatment group (intervention vs control), a random effect for each school to account for clustering of responses within schools and an interaction term (treatment × subgroup) to determine differential intervention effect.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study sought to examine the differential effectiveness of a universally delivered school-based ‘resilience’ protective factor intervention on substance use by adolescents according to their baseline sociodemographic characteristics and previous substance use. The study found negligible evidence (1 of 36 tests) of differential intervention effectiveness between student subgroups. A differential intervention effect was found for number of cigarettes smoked by recent smokers, by socioeconomic status which, on further examination within subgroups, showed no significant difference in the consumption of cigarettes in intervention compared with control students residing within either subgroup. These findings, coupled with the primary study finding of no intervention effect on any measure of adolescent substance use or protective factors for the overall trial sample,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> suggests that a pragmatic approach to the universal delivery of a resilience-focused substance use intervention was not effective at any level.</p>
              <p>The findings of the study with respect to subgroups defined by sociodemographic characteristics are generally consistent with previous universal school-based studies that targeted protective factors as part of a broader intervention approach. With respect to subgroups defined by gender, previous studies have reported equivocal support for such interventions being effective for alcohol or illicit substance use for males only,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> for females only<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> or effective for both males and females<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> in comparison with the current study that found no differential effect. Only one previous study was identified that investigated differential effectiveness of such an intervention approach by socioeconomic status, which reported an intervention effect for drunkenness for students of low but not high socioeconomic status.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> No previous studies were identified that investigated differential intervention effectiveness by geographic location for universal school-based protective factor interventions.</p>
              <p>The findings of previous studies of intervention effectiveness by subgroups defined by previous substance use are equivocal. For example, previous studies have found no evidence of differential intervention effect between subgroups defined by previous substance use for both tobacco<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>and alcohol.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> In contrast, other studies have found results favouring students who have never used a substance<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and those who are previous substance users.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p>
              <p>The absence of an intervention effect for the hypothesised mechanism of intervention effect, resilience protective factors, for both the overall trial sample<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and across all subgroups assessed in this study precludes the ability to determine whether the enhancement of protective factors can lead to a reduction in adolescent substance use. However, the singular significant result in this study regarding the consumption of tobacco for recent smokers by socioeconomic status suggests that despite not impacting on protective factor levels, the intervention may have a differential effect on socioeconomically disadvantaged compared with advantaged students. Such results may suggest that an alternative mechanism may be responsible for the decrease in tobacco consumption. A more likely explanation for the singular result for 1 of 36 tests undertaken is that the result was false positive due to the number of tests that were conducted.</p>
              <p>Various aspects of the intervention design may have contributed to the null finding for resilience protective factors both overall and within the student subgroups and have been reported previously.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> First, the universal delivery of the intervention without any differentiation or targeted intervention for students with lower protective factor scores or students at greater risk within particular student subgroups may have limited its ability to impact across all students. Second, the use of a pragmatic intervention approach involving school staff selection and implementation of existing readily available curriculum resources and programmes and flexibility regarding the order in which selected resources were implemented may have contributed to the null study findings as pragmatic intervention approaches have been reported to be less likely to be effective than non-pragmatic approaches.<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72 73</xref> As previously reported, data regarding similar levels of implementation for 15 of 16 targeted strategies in both intervention and control groups suggests the use of programmes and resources that were also accessible to control schools may also have led to a lack of differential intervention exposure between group<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> or may be an indication of cross-site contamination. Third, the duration of the intervention primarily over 2 years may have resulted in insufficient exposure to impact on student protective factors. Finally, the intervention’s focus on protective factors only, with no content addressing known risk factors of substance use (such as peer substance use<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), and a limited focus on family and community-based protective factors of substance use<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> may have impacted on the findings.</p>
              <p>Strengths of the overall study included the cluster-randomised controlled study design, the use of implementation support strategies and it being a real-world pragmatic effectiveness trial. This study adhered to criteria for a best practice analytical approach to subgroup analyses<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> with the exception that secondary outcomes (ie, resilience protective factor outcomes) were examined in subgroups, and the proposed subgroup analyses were not published a priori. In terms of further limitations, the number of comparisons undertaken within this study may have increased the risk of type 1 error and led to the sole significant result; however, the use of a formal statistical interaction test, rather than examination of intervention effect within individual subgroups, reduces this risk.<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> In the overall study, the proportion of enrolled students completing both the baseline and follow-up surveys was below 50%, and while typical for school-based research,<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> it may limit the generalisability of the study results. Additionally, despite the scale of the overall study in 32 secondary schools, it was not designed to be powered to detect differences in outcomes within participant subgroups. As a result, any actual differences in intervention effectiveness by subgroup may not have been detectable. The small sample size of the exposure groups in some of the subgroup analyses, such as examination of differences in the number of cigarettes smoked, further limited the statistical power to detect differences between groups. As a result, the subgroup analyses are considered exploratory in order to generate hypotheses for future research and should be interpreted with caution. While the effect of the intervention on illicit substance use among students with low socioeconomic status was double that of students with high socioeconomic status appears promising, it is unclear whether such a result would be substantiated in a study sufficiently powered to detect difference in outcomes within participants subgroups. Finally, the study was limited by its focus on adolescent substance use and resilience outcomes, and the impact of the intervention on other student outcomes, such as alcohol-related harm, or implementation outcomes, such as assessment of teacher impact on intervention implementation, was not assessed.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This exploratory study found negligible evidence of an intervention effect on adolescent substance use and protective factors outcomes according to student sociodemographic or substance use characteristics following implementation of a universal school-based resilience intervention. While there was some evidence of a differential intervention effect on tobacco use by smokers in subgroup analysis by socioeconomic status, which suggests there may be some potential for a resilience intervention in reducing tobacco use within this group of students, the result should be interpreted with caution and further sufficiently powered research conducted to confirm this.</p>
