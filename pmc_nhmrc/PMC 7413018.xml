                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a global problem that causes significant pain and physical dysfunction, substantially impacting on quality of life and imposing enormous cost to the healthcare system. Exercise is pivotal to OA management, yet uptake by people with knee OA is inadequate. Limited access to appropriately skilled health professionals, such as physiotherapists, for prescription of an exercise program and support with exercise is a major barrier to optimal care. Internet-enabled video consultations permit widespread reach. However, services offering video consultations with physiotherapists for musculoskeletal conditions are scant in Australia where there is typically no Government or private health insurer funding for such services. The paucity of robust evidence demonstrating video consultations with physiotherapists are clinically effective, safe and cost-effective for knee OA is hampering implementation of, and willingness of healthcare policymakers to pay for, these services.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is an assessor- and participant-blinded, two-arm, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Australia. We are recruiting 394 people from the community with chronic knee pain consistent with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA. Participants are randomly allocated to receive physiotherapy care via i) video-conferencing or; ii) face-to-face consultations. Participants are provided five consultations (30â45âmin each) with a physiotherapist over 3âmonths for prescription of a home-based strengthening exercise program (to be conducted independently at home) and physical activity plan, as well as OA education. Participants in both groups are provided with educational booklets and simple exercise equipment via post. The co-primary outcomes are change in self-reported i) knee pain on walking; and ii) physical function, with a primary end-point of 3âmonths and a secondary end-point of 9âmonths. Secondary outcomes include changes in other clinical outcomes (health-related quality of life; therapeutic relationship; global ratings of change; satisfaction with care; self-efficacy; physical activity levels), time and financial costs of attending consultations, healthcare usage and convenience. Non-inferiority will be assessed using the per-protocol dataset.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par22">Arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions are an Australian National Health Priority Area, and more prevalent in Australia than any other, including cancer, diabetes and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Osteoarthritis, particularly of the knee, is a leading cause of pain and disability in Australia, and the 12th highest contributor to global disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Around 2.1 million Australians (1 in 11 people) have OA, with a 58% increase expected by 2032 due to population ageing and rising obesity rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This reflects international data showing that OA accounted for 303.1 million prevalent cases across the globe in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with a 9.3% increase in age-standardised point prevalence since 2010. Knee OA can be extremely debilitating. Pain is a major symptom and it may become persistent and more limiting over time. Physical function can become increasingly impaired and may impact substantially on quality of life and ability to participate in social, leisure and occupational activities. Health expenditure on OA in Australia in 2012 was $3.75 billion, with most costs related to conservative and surgical treatments, lost productivity and loss of quality of life. With the aging and increasing obesity of the worldâs population, a large increase in demand for health services for knee OA is expected in the future.</p>
              <p id="Par23">There is no cure for OA. Treatments to reduce symptoms and delay or prevent joint replacement are critical. Clinical guidelines for management of knee OA emphasise non-drug non-surgical strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] that focus on self-help and patient-driven options rather than clinician-delivered passive therapies. In particular, advice and information for self-management, exercise and weight control (if required) are core management, with drugs, injections and manual therapy considered adjunctive to core treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Exercise is advised for all people with knee OA irrespective of age, OA severity, pain, function and comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The benefits of exercise for knee OA on pain, physical function and quality of life are well-established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given that muscle weakness is widespread in knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], muscle strengthening is an important component of exercise programs for people with the condition.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Knee OA is mostly managed in primary care settings, with physiotherapists frequently involved in provision of care. Physiotherapy is traditionally provided during face-to-face consultations in the clinic. However, for many people, access to physiotherapy is hampered by geographical isolation and/or limited physiotherapy services. This is particularly a problem in regional and remote areas where services are often limited or non-existent. Face-to-face consultations also pose an infection risk for both the physiotherapist and the patient. This has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic where many physiotherapy practices across the globe have restricted or ceased face-to-face consultations and instead shifted towards telehealth, in order to safeguard the health of both patients and staff.</p>
              <p id="Par25">We conducted the first RCT evaluating efficacy of video consultations with a physiotherapist for exercise management of knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We recruited 148 older people around Australia and compared video consultations (delivered by 8 different physiotherapists) combined with a self-directed online pain coping skills program, versus online education. Findings showed that the intervention significantly improved knee pain and physical function by clinically meaningful amounts at 3âmonths, and that benefits were sustained at 9âmonths. Furthermore, nested qualitative research showed that video consultations were acceptable to both patients and physiotherapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patient convenience, flexibility, empowerment to self-manage and positive therapeutic relationships were emphasised by both patients and physiotherapists. Patients were very satisfied with the care they received and believed it was effective for them personally. These findings reflect survey data in people with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and in patients attending hospital-based physiotherapy screening clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], as well as RCT findings in patients following joint replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Collectively, research indicates most patients are willing to engage in video consultations for chronic musculoskeletal conditions. However, there is no research comparing the effectiveness of video-conferencing with physiotherapists to face-to-face consultations for people with knee OA.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The primary aim of this RCT is to determine if video-conferencing consultations are non-inferior to face-to-face consultations with a physiotherapist for improving knee pain on walking and/or physical function at 3âmonths (primary time-point) and 9âmonths (secondary time-point), in people with knee OA. We hypothesise that video consultations are not inferior for improving knee pain on walking and/or physical function compared to face-to-face care in people with knee OA. Secondary aims are to compare the clinical effectiveness (health-related quality of life, therapeutic relationship, global ratings of change, satisfaction with care, self-efficacy, physical activity levels), cost-effectiveness (participant-level travel time and travel-related costs, health care usage) and convenience of video-conferencing consultations to face-to-face consultations, as well as explore potential moderators of treatment effect.</p>

                <p id="Par50">The flow of participants through the RCT is outlined in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. All potential participants receive oral and written information about the purposes, potential risks and processes involved in the study from the Trial Coordinator. Once participants pass the telephone screening process, which involves a detailed verbal description of the project, they are sent a Plain Language Statement and Consent Form in the post or by email. Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC No. 1953585.1). All participants provide written informed consent.

                <p id="Par51">All outcomes are participant-reported. Participants complete outcome assessments via electronic survey (REDCap) or paper-based (returned via mail for the minority that may request this). In addition, all participants record attendance at, and travel information about, physiotherapy consultations using a log book which is mailed back to research staff. As a reminder, research staff contact any participant who has failed to submit a survey and/or return a log book by the due date. Every effort is being made to minimize loss of data, including collection of primary outcome data over the telephone if necessary.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Immediately upon receipt of the signed consent form and completed baseline survey, a participant is randomized to either video-conferencing or face-to-face consultations with the trial physiotherapist of their choice (usually selected on the basis of geographical location). Participants are provided five physiotherapy consultations over a 12-week intervention period. Research staff book the first two consultations on behalf of the participant with the physiotherapistâs clinic at mutually agreeable times. Thereafter, the physiotherapist and participants arrange subsequent bookings together at the conclusion of each consultation.</p>

                <title>Randomisation, blinding and allocation concealment</title>
                <p id="Par53">The randomisation schedule was prepared by a biostatistician using permuted block sizes 6 to 12 and a randomisation ratio of 1:1, stratified by trial physiotherapist. Where physiotherapists practice at two different clinic locations, randomisation is stratified by location within the physiotherapist. The randomisation schedule is stored on a password-protected website (REDCap) at the University of Melbourne and maintained by a researcher not involved in either participant recruitment or administration of primary/secondary outcome measures. Group allocation is revealed by this same researcher after baseline assessment has been completed.</p>
                <p id="Par54">Participants are blinded to group allocation by a process of limited disclosure. Participants are informed that physiotherapy services in the âreal-worldâ may be provided in a variety of settings and models of delivery, such as face-to-face care, telephone consultations, video-conferencing, individual consultations, group classes, community health services, rehabilitation services, private practices and hospital settings and home visits. They are informed that the purpose of the RCT is to compare the effectiveness of two different models of physiotherapy service. Although participants are informed they will receive a series of consultations with a physiotherapist (for education, strengthening exercise and a physical activity plan), they are not told that video-conferencing is being compared to face-face individual consultations. Participants will not be informed about the study hypotheses, or the model of care received by the comparator group, until the study is completed, at which time they will also be provided a lay summary of findings. As all outcomes are participant-reported, and participants are blinded, this study is thus also considered assessor-blinded. It is not possible to blind physiotherapists as they are providing consultations to both trial arms (in order to ensure physiotherapist-related factors such as personality, clinical practice experience etc. are similar across groups and cannot confound results). Statistical analyses will be performed in a blinded manner.</p>

In summary, physiotherapists aim to prescribe an individualised exercise program comprising 5â6 strengthening exercises to be performed at home three times/week, including two quadriceps exercises, one hip/gluteal exercise, one hamstrings/gluteal exercise, one calf exercise, and one other as appropriate. Exercises are selected from an Exercise Booklet containing 37 exercises in total (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), many with a range of potential variations to make them harder or easier as required. The intensity for the strengthening exercises is aimed at 5â7 out of ten (or, âhard to very hardâ) on the modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] for strength training. Review and modification of the strengthening program occurs at each consultation. Progression is guided by American College of Sports Medicine principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] via adjustments to repetitions, direction, and speed of movements; increasing resistance; and/or changing stance surface.

Participants use a wearable activity tracker to assist this and the physiotherapist and participant devise individualised step goals that are reviewed and modified (if required) at each consultation. Participants are encouraged to use the âKnee Plan and Log Bookâ for recording both their strengthening exercise program and physical activity plan after each consultation, and monitoring progress for discussion with the physiotherapist at the next consultation. Education about OA and its management occurs at all sessions, including discussion about the role of exercise and physical activity, including barriers to adherence and strategies for overcoming obstacles. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> outlines the different education topics at each consultation.</p>
                  <p id="Par80">Participants are encouraged and advised how to independently progress their exercise program and their physical activity plan between consultations, and beyond, once the physiotherapist consultations have ceased. Participants are encouraged to continue with their strengthening exercises and physical activity plan after the physiotherapist consultations have finished, up until the final outcome measurements are collected at 9âmonths. Participant use of monitoring and tracking tools (âKnee Plan and Log Bookâ; wearable activity tracker) is encouraged during the consultations, and beyond, to facilitate ongoing adherence to strengthening exercise and physical activity.</p>

Participants travel to and from the clinic at their own expense. Physiotherapists use their usual clinical methods for teaching the strengthening exercise program (ie demonstration, watching and correcting participant technique). Consultations are audio-recorded using digital audio recorders and uploaded by the physiotherapist to a secure password-protected cloud-based system.</p>
                  <p id="Par82"><underline>Video consultations</underline> - participants allocated to this group attend all of their consultations using the video-conferencing facility of Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc., USA), a commercial cloud-based system accessible from any internet-connected computer, laptop or mobile device. Physiotherapists consult from their clinic using a lap-top or desk-top computer, whilst participants are based at their home (or elsewhere if preferred). Instructions for accessing and downloading Zoom are provided to participants and participants are encouraged to independently set themselves up in readiness for their first consultation. Physiotherapists are given access to a bespoke website containing a video library of all exercises contained within the âExercise Bookletâ so that they can provide real-time demonstration of exercises to participants during video-conferencing, using the share-screen feature of Zoom. Participants do not have access to the online video library outside of the consultations. Video-conferencing consultations are video-recorded via Zoom and files are stored on a secure password-protected cloud-based system.</p>

Fidelity will be recorded as the number and proportion of i) strengthening exercise programs prescribed by the second consultation; ii) physical activity plans prescribed by the second consultation; iii) follow-up consultations that reviewed strengthening programs; iv) follow-up consultations that reviewed physical activity plans; v) consultations where the RPE for the strength program was between 5 and 7; vi) all consultations that included education.

Furthermore, assessing both of these symptoms as quality indicators for the primary care of OA, is advocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus we have chosen co-primary outcomes of change in i) pain; and ii) physical function, both of which are also specifically advocated for use in clinical trials in people with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

                <title>Statistical analysis plan</title>
                <p id="Par107">The a priori statistical analysis plan is described below. Any future amendments to this statistical plan will be documented, dated and explained in an electronic log kept by the research team, which will be made available upon request. A biostatistician will perform data analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par108">Consistent with OARSI guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], non-inferiority will be assessed using the per-protocol dataset (including only those randomized participants who attended â¥3 consultations). Between-group differences in mean change in pain and function (baseline minus follow-up) will be compared using linear regression modelling adjusted for baseline and the stratifying variable of physiotherapist. If a physiotherapist treats participants at two locations, two separate terms for that physiotherapist, corresponding to each location, will be included. Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for between-group difference (video-conferencing minus face-to-face) is above ââ0.95 for change in pain and/orâââ5.44 for change in function, at 3âmonths. 95% CIs correspond to testing the null hypothesis of non-inferiority at a one-sided significance level of 2.5%. Due to difficulties with their interpretation, <italic>p</italic>-values associated with non-inferiority hypotheses are not commonly reported and will not be reported here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Multiple imputation will be used to impute missing data, and an intention-to-treat analysis (including all participants in their randomised groups) will be conducted to help assess robustness of conclusions (sensitivity analysis). Given that participants with knee OA seek physiotherapy care for different reasons, we will interpret and report findings transparently and separately for each co-primary outcome. For example, if we demonstrate non-inferiority of video consultations with respect to function but not pain, we will conclude that video consultations are non-inferior to face-to-face care for improving function but are inferior for pain relief in people with knee OA. Patients seeking care, and physiotherapists delivering care, will then be fully informed about benefits, and limitations, of video consultations compared to face-to-face care with respect to the different co-primary outcomes. If non-inferiority of a co-primary outcome is demonstrated, superiority of the outcome will then be assessed using the intention-to-treat dataset and declared if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for between-group difference exceeds zero.</p>
                <p id="Par109">Secondary outcomes will be assessed using data from all participants (i.e. the intention-to-treat sample) and confidence intervals will be interpreted using the superiority framework since we have not pre-defined any NIMs for these outcomes. Linear regression models will be fit to compare continuous outcomes; proportional odds models to compare improvement based on global change; and Poisson or negative binomial regression models to compare count outcomes as appropriate. Assumptions will be assessed using standard diagnostic plots and methods. Since these are all secondary analyses, <italic>p</italic>-values for these assessments will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In addition, the outcomes of participant time, physiotherapist time and travel time will be compared between treatment groups using the superiority framework, similarly to other secondary outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par110">Irrespective of the outcomes of the non-inferiority analysis, we will conduct exploratory analyses to evaluate moderation of the effect of video-conferencing versus face-to-face consultations on primary outcomes by pre-specified potential moderators, i) experience with online video platforms; ii) geographical residence; iii) beliefs about physiotherapy care delivery; and iv) confidence using technology. This will be assessed by including appropriate interaction terms between the moderators and the intervention term, where the superiority framework will be applied for interpreting results.

                <p id="Par115">A health economist will oversee assessment of incremental direct and indirect costs of video consultations compared to face-to-face. Primary evaluation will be between-group difference in knee-related health care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using generalised linear models to adjust for baseline. Non-inferiority in QALYs will be demonstrated if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for between-group difference of the AQoL-6D is above ââ0.08 (half a SD). If one type of consultation is superior but costs more, QALYs will be calculated using area under the curve over 9âmonths. The incremental cost per QALY as the ratio of difference in mean cost to difference in mean QALYs, and net benefits as the difference in QALYs times the social value of a QALY minus the difference in cost, will then be calculated. If non-inferiority of QALYs is demonstrated, then inferiority in terms of cost (and net benefits) will then be assessed if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for between-group difference exceeds zero. In a secondary analysis, the cost of patient time will be included as an additional cost component.</p>

Patients with knee OA were involved in i) review of the plain language statement and consent form, particularly the text related to limited disclosure; ii) review and completion of the electronic outcome measurement survey; iii) testing the participant instructions for, and use of, the wearable activity tracker; iv) testing participant instructions for, and use of, Zoom for video-conferencing; v) review of other participant resources (Osteoarthritis Information, Exercise Booklet) and the Appointment Log Book used in data collection; vi) creation of telehealth training videos for the physiotherapist e-learning modules, and exercise videos/photographs for the website/Exercise Booklet, as patient actors; and vii) review of study logo. Patients provided feedback to the research team about information content, presentation and readability, as well as time taken to complete the outcome measurement survey. Patients with knee OA also participated in pilot âpractice consultationsâ with the trial physiotherapists as part of the physiotherapistâs training procedures.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par120">Although our prior research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed that video consultations with a physiotherapist (combined with pain coping skills training) are efficacious compared to online education, it remains unclear how effective video consultations are compared to traditional face-face physiotherapy care. Physiotherapy is viewed by the public and the wider healthcare community as a profession associated with âhands-onâ and âphysicalâ treatments. Foster and Delitto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] have described how perceptions of physiotherapy professional culture form, and how patient preferences and expectations drive clinician practice and beliefs. Patients often expect to receive manual therapy treatments when consulting a physiotherapist, and physiotherapists themselves have traditionally been trained in a biomedical approach emphasising âhands-onâ assessment and treatment techniques, despite the limited evidence for these approaches in many chronic musculoskeletal conditions, including knee OA. Robust high-quality non-inferiority RCTs are required to provide evidence that video consultations are non-inferior to face-to-face care in order to drive changes in service delivery models and funding policy.</p>
              <p id="Par121">Our trial is robust and will provide high-quality evidence about the effectiveness of video-conferencing compared to face-to-face physiotherapy care. Most pragmatic RCTs are superiority trials, which assess if a new approach is more effective than another standard intervention. In contrast, non-inferiority trials assess whether the effects of the new approach are within a predefined clinically acceptable margin of the effects of the standard approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Non-inferiority RCTs typically require larger sample sizes than superiority trials because the NIM is typically smaller than the treatment effect that a similar superiority trial comparing the standard treatment to a comparison/placebo would be powered to detect. The study power of non-inferiority trials is usually chosen to be high (usually 90%) to minimise the risk that a non-inferior treatment is missed due to chance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Within our RCT, we plan to conduct a linked discrete choice experiment exploring patient preferences for receiving physiotherapy care, as well as qualitative evaluations of i) physiotherapist experiences with training for the trial; and ii) physiotherapist and patient experiences with, and attitudes towards, video consultations. These linked studies will be reported separately from the main trial findings.</p>
              <p id="Par122">A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of treatment delivered via telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Of the 14 trials included, only three in people with OA were identified (one of these with a sample of mixed arthritic diagnoses) and none investigated video consultations. All three were superiority trials that utilized the telephone for consultations, and only one evaluated physiotherapy. Although a large equivalence trial showed that telephone-delivered physiotherapy care was equally clinically effective as usual care in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], a diverse sample of participants with mixed musculoskeletal conditions was recruited and video consultations were not evaluated. The paucity of literature evaluating the effectiveness of video consultations for management of knee OA is a barrier to its implementation as an alternative method of delivering care by physiotherapists. A significant limitation is the absence of data about its cost-effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par123">The Australian Telehealth Society has called for increased research to better understand the economic benefits of telehealth, particularly for patients and the broader health system, and not just funders of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In its National Telehealth Strategy, the Australian Telehealth Society has also recognized the need to investigate the impact of telehealth on consumers, arguing telehealth will not succeed unless consumers can access it and find value in it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Key actions in this Strategy include determining consumer attitudes, enablers and barriers to telehealth and assessment of consumer feedback from telehealth trials. Findings from the PEAK RCT will provide valuable evidence about the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of video-conferencing by physiotherapists for people with knee OA. Results will inform the development and implementation of telehealth physiotherapy models and will have relevance to other chronic musculoskeletal diseases where education, exercise and physical activity are a cornerstone of management. Trial findings will be particularly relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic which has prompted many health services globally to switch from face-to-face consultations to video-conferencing in order to protect the health of both patients and staff.</p>
