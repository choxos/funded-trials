                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used to treat men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. Men receiving ADT experience numerous side effects and frequently report unmet supportive care needs. An essential part of quality cancer care is survivorship care. To date, an optimal effective approach to survivorship care for men with prostate cancer on ADT has not been described. This protocol describes a randomised trial of tele-based nurse-led survivorship that addresses this knowledge gap: (1) determine the effectiveness of a nurse-led survivorship care intervention (PCEssentials), relative to usual care, for improving health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in men with prostate cancer undergoing ADT and (2) evaluate PCEssentials implementation strategies and outcomes, including cost-effectiveness, compared with usual care.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid (type 1) trial with participants randomised to one of two arms: (1) minimally enhanced usual care and (2) nurse-led prostate cancer survivorship essentials (PCEssentials) delivered over four tele-based sessions, with a booster session 5‚Äâmonths after session 1. Eligible participants are Australian men with prostate cancer commencing ADT and expected to be on ADT for a minimum of 12 months. Participants are followed up at 3, 6 and 12‚Äâmonths postrecruitment. Primary outcomes are HR-QoL and self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes are psychological distress, insomnia, fatigue and physical activity. A concurrent process evaluation with participants and study stakeholders will be undertaken to determine effectiveness of delivery of PCEssentials.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer diagnosed in Australia.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While men are living longer following diagnosis, longitudinal research has characterised a subgroup of 35%‚Äì40% of men who experience long-term decrements in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In particular, men who are on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) experience consistently poorer physical and mental HR-QoL over the long term.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2‚Äì6</xref>
</p>
              <p>While ADT is effective in treating PCa and increasing survival, it is associated with multiple, often debilitating side effects, which manifest as changes in physical, cognitive, social and sexual functioning.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 7‚Äì9</xref> Iatrogenic effects may include mood disturbances, increased fat mass, body feminisation, cognitive decline, functional impairment, frailty, fatigue and sexual dysfunction.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4 6‚Äì10</xref> ADT also increases the risk of developing new comorbidities, including cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, sarcopenia and osteoporosis.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Compared with men receiving other treatments, those undergoing ADT report poorer HR-QoL and higher levels of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, relationship changes, cognitive and affective symptoms, and sleep disturbances.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4 6‚Äì9 12</xref> The prevalence of psychological distress in PCa survivors is reported to be between 11% and 27%,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and regardless of other treatments, receiving ADT is predictive of higher distress.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Further, men undergoing ADT have an increased risk of suicide compared with those who do not, particularly in older men and in the first 6‚Äâmonths postdiagnosis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Unmet supportive care needs are highly prevalent in these men, with unmet physical, psychological, sexual, existential and informational<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 15</xref> needs that persist at 15 years postdiagnosis.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Over one-third (37%) of men with PCa will report at least one long-term unmet supportive care need particularly at the start of treatment when side effects are new or unknown and HR-QoL is first impacted.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This is of particular concern for men receiving ADT who report feeling unprepared to manage substantial treatment side effects that impact on quality of life.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Further, despite routine clinical follow-up, men receiving ADT rarely receive tailored person-centred interventions in a timely manner, adversely impacting HR-QoL with poor management of side effects and self-efficacy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 15</xref> Men treated with ADT are a vulnerable high-need patient group for whom evidence-based survivorship care is crucial.</p>

                <title>Preliminary research on survivorship care for men with PCa</title>
                <p>Previous PCa survivorship guidelines published by the American Cancer Society a decade ago<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> were limited by an over reliance on expert opinion and lack of a robust evidence base.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Existing survivorship guidelines have also been limited by lack of consumer involvement.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Our group has contextualised survivorship care for PCa<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 22 23</xref> and produced a contemporary survivorship care framework for men with PCa. The resulting survivorship essentials framework (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) proposes holistic survivorship care for men with PCa and was developed by a uniquely inclusive expert clinical and community group.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The framework has been widely endorsed by key PCa and urological groups in Australia and New Zealand. Based on our survivorship framework, we have developed a new model of care, prostate cancer survivorship essentials (PCEssentials), which integrates evidence-based strategies to improve men‚Äôs quality of life outcomes after ADT in a men-centred approach, where personal agency intersects with all aspects of care.</p>

                <p>We propose an Australian effectiveness-implementation hybrid (type 1) randomised trial<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> of tele-based nurse-led survivorship care with 236 PCa survivors undergoing ADT. This is the first such study internationally to address this problem. The proposed study will have two arms: (1) minimally enhanced usual care and (2) nurse-led prostate cancer survivorship essentials (PCEssentials) delivered over four tele-based sessions, with a subsequent booster session 5‚Äâmonths after the first session. In accordance with a type 1 hybrid trial, a concurrent process evaluation, guided by the conceptual framework for implementation outcomes,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> will be undertaken to determine effectiveness of the PCEssentials intervention delivery, and the potential for implementation of the intervention at scale.</p>

                <p>We hypothesise that PCEssentials will be more cost-effective than usual care. Furthermore, relative to men receiving usual care at 3, 6 and 12‚Äâmonths after recruitment, men who receive PCEssentials will have: (1) higher HR-QoL, (2) increased self-efficacy, (3) less psychological distress and (4) improved sleep and lower fatigue.</p>

                  <p>The study is a two-arm randomised controlled trial with repeated assessments across time and with continuous primary outcome variables. Recruitment bias will be assessed by comparing sociodemographic and clinical variables for consenters with non-consenters using t-tests (or Mann-Whitney U tests) for continuous variables and œá<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables. Possible differential attrition will be assessed by comparing baseline characteristics of drop-outs and continuing participants using t-tests (or Mann-Whitney U tests if appropriate) for continuous variables and œá<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted. Between-group mean differences in change from baseline outcome scores at 3, 6 and 12 months will be analysed by fitting mixed effects regression models. Intervention (intervention/usual care) will be included as the main effect. Indicators for participants will be included as a random effect to account for the non-independence of repeated observations from the same individual. Sensitivity analysis will assess the effects of attrition. Mixed effects models with maximum likelihood estimation minimise bias that may arise from ignoring missing observations, and use all available data, thereby maximising statistical power to detect effects. The mean and 95% CI will be calculated for satisfaction with the intervention. Missing data will be examined for patterns of missingness and addressed with the appropriate multiple imputation methods, if required. The investigator team includes a dedicated biostatistician who will undertake analyses.</p>

                  <p>A cost‚Äìutility analysis of the intervention relative to minimally enhanced usual care from both healthcare payer and societal perspectives will be conducted alongside the PCEssentials trial. Costs will be obtained by identifying, measuring and valuing the health resources used. At baseline, participants are given a health service use diary to record direct health resources utilised (eg, general practitioner visits, treatments and hospitalisations), as well as out-of-pocket expenses and indirect costs (eg, productivity loss). The diaries will also be collected during the T2, T3 and T4 assessments. Healthcare resources will be valued using unit prices from standard costing resources such as the Medicare Benefits Schedule and relevant Australian award wages. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained will be estimated, which is a measure of a patient‚Äôs life expectancy, weighted by his HR-QoL (ie, utility score) measured using the AQoL-8D at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. A multivariate generalised linear model will be used to adjust for differences in baseline AQoL-8D scores, demographics and disease classifications. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated, which is the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in mean QALYs. Non-parametric bootstrapping will be used to characterise uncertainty around the ICER. If the intervention appears to be cost-effective, we will calculate the expected value of implementation, which is the net monetary benefit of the intervention (ie, monetary benefits‚Äîcosts) multiplied by the population of PCa patients expected to benefit from the intervention and adjusted by various patients‚Äô adherence and clinicians‚Äô uptake rates. Uptake rates will be obtained from a formal elicitation exercise and will inform a Bass model to forecast diffusion (ie, implementation over time).<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>
