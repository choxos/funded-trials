                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Incidence of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) for Indigenous Australians is especially high in remote and very remote areas of Australia (18 and 20 times the rate of comparable non-Indigenous people). Relocating away from family and country for treatment, adjusting to life with a chronic condition and time lost to dialysis cause grief and sadness which have immense impact on quality of life and challenges treatment adherence. We describe the first randomised controlled trial to address both chronic disease and mental health in Indigenous people with ESKD, which is the first to test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted e-mental health intervention in this population. It builds on an existing program of mental health research with demonstrated efficacy â€“ the Aboriginal and Islander Mental Health Initiative (AIMhi) â€“ to test the newly developed electronic motivational care planning (MCP) therapy â€“ the AIMhi Stay Strong App.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a 3-arm, waitlist, single-blind randomised controlled trial testing the efficacy of the Stay Strong App in improving psychological distress, depressive symptoms, quality of life and treatment adherence among Indigenous clients undergoing haemodialysis for ESKD in Alice Springs and Darwin with follow up over two periods of 3Â months (total of 6Â months observation). The study compares the efficacy of MCP using the AIMhi Stay Strong App with two control groups (control app intervention and treatment as usual) on participant-reported psychological distress (the primary outcome) using the Kessler Distress Scale (K10); depressive symptoms using the adapted Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); quality of life using the EuroQoL instrument (EQ5D) and adherence to dialysis treatment planning through file audit. Participants are randomised to receive MCP either at baseline (early treatment) or after 3Â months (delayed treatment). The study also examines the cost effectiveness of this therapy in this setting through examination of health care service utilisation across groups during the first 3Â months.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This project will contribute much needed evidence on the efficacy of an electronic wellbeing intervention for Indigenous people with ESKD â€“ a group in which distress is likely to be unacceptably high, yet relatively untreated.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">The incidence of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) for Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory (NT) is 15.3 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians, with the burden of the disease on the increase (96% increase in Indigenous incidence nationally over the 1991â€“2010 period) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. People with ESKD require renal replacement therapy (regular dialysis or kidney transplant) to survive. Such treatments are resource intensive adding to an already high burden for the individual and health care system.</p>
              <p id="Par21">People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) sustain many losses - physical functions, cognitive abilities, and role in the family and workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and depression is common in those undergoing dialysis (25% with depressive symptoms when assessed by clinical interview, 40% when assessed by self-report measures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These levels are unacceptably high given that depressive symptoms are a risk factor for poor outcome in people with ESKD on dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Early intervention for psychological distress among people with CKD has the potential to prevent or defer onset of chronic and debilitating mental disorders and minimise the impact of wellbeing concerns on adherence and treatment outcomes. Meta-analyses estimate reductions in incidence of depression of approximately 20% when preventative interventions are delivered to the general population with no diagnosed depression at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Despite recognition that psychosocial factors are associated with morbidity and mortality in many chronic conditions, including CKD, well-designed intervention studies are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The most recent Cochrane Review (2005) failed to identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing psychosocial interventions for depressed people on dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a significant lack of rigorous effectiveness trials for mental health interventions in an Indigenous context generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given the scarcity of evidence, RCTs in this area are desperately needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">One of the very few formally evaluated, culturally-adapted, mental health and chronic disease self-management interventions for Indigenous people was developed through the Aboriginal and Islander Mental Health Initiative (AIMhi). Assessment, psycho-education, and care-planning resources were developed following extensive consultation and collaboration with local Aboriginal mental health workers (AMHW) through exploration of local Indigenous perspectives of mental health and with recognition of the holistic nature of wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. â€˜Motivational care planningâ€™ (MCP) combines problem solving therapy and motivational interviewing, to create a â€˜low-intensityâ€™ treatment that differs from established approaches by utilising a holistic, strengths-based approach with pictorial tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It was evaluated in one of the first successful NHMRC-funded RCTs assessing mental health interventions in a remote Indigenous context, with further qualitative studies and evaluations confirming acceptability and feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The RCT showed that the MCP intervention resulted in significant improvements in well-being, life skills, and alcohol dependence among Indigenous clients with chronic mental illness, with changes sustained over 18Â months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">MCP is a theoretically sound, evidence-based approach to comorbidity, which has been used in settings other than mental health including substance misuse, gambling and chronic disease self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The therapy adopts an empowering, person-centred, holistic and strengths based perspective which acknowledges and promotes Indigenous cultural and family values and client self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The AIMhi MCP intervention has recently been translated into a digital (tablet) format (the AIMhi Stay Strong App), making it even more interactive and visually appealing. The result is the first available e-mental health approach developed specifically for Indigenous Australians.</p>
              <p id="Par26">This study examines the 3- and 6-month impact and cost effectiveness of the MCP therapy delivered by the AIMhi Stay Strong App for improving mental health and wellbeing in a renal dialysis setting, relative to two control conditions.</p>

                <title>Aims</title>
                <p id="Par27">The primary aim of the study is to determine whether MCP using the AIMhi Stay Strong App reduces psychological distress for Indigenous people receiving haemodialysis, relative to delayed-treatment control groups at 3Â months, and whether benefits are maintained at 6Â months post-recruitment. Secondary aims test the impact of MCP using the AIMhi Stay Strong App in improving depressive symptoms, Quality of Life (QoL) and dialysis treatment adherence. We also aim to examine the cost effectiveness of this therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par28">We hypothesise that MCP therapy using the AIMhi Stay Strong App will be cost-effective and superior to both a contact control using another app (Hep B Story) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and usual care, in reducing psychological distress and depressive symptoms, and improving quality of life and dialysis treatment adherence at 3Â months. We expect that MCP that is received in the control groups after the 3-month assessment will result in those groups showing improvements in these outcomes between 3 and 6Â months.</p>

                <title>Participants and setting</title>
                <p id="Par30">Indigenous people presenting to participating haemodialysis services in Alice Springs and Darwin â€“ Western Desert Nganampa Walytja Palyantjaku Tjutaku (WDNWPT), Central Australian Renal Services, and Top End Renal Services, are approached to provide informed consent. Approximately 80% of participants are expected to speak English as a second or third language. Inclusion criteria include identification as an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander person and aged â‰¥18Â years, currently receiving maintenance haemodialysis in Alice Springs or Darwin and having been receiving this treatment for more than 6Â months. Exclusion Criteria are aged &lt;â€‰18Â years, guardianship order in place, or inability to provide informed consent (e.g. because of cognitive or visual impairment). Whether potential participants meet criteria for inclusion is determined through liaison between project staff and the patientâ€™s care coordinator.</p>

                <title>Consent and culturally appropriate approach</title>
                <p id="Par31">Research officers use pictorial information sheets and flipcharts, screening and intervention tools which use plain English and are available in 11 NT Aboriginal languages, to assist understanding. Participants are offered communication support (interpreters, translators, language recordings). Demographic information and outcome measures are collected using a tablet device that includes pictorial prompts and Aboriginal language recordings for each item (choice of 11 NT languages). Interpreters are also utilised where necessary. Assessment and treatment sessions occur at a place that is identified by the participant as most comfortable for them, which may be outdoors, at the clinic, while receiving dialysis, or at their accommodation.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par32">Eligible participants are randomised following baseline assessment using a block sequential random number sequence and an envelope system of randomisation, stratified by site, level of psychological distress (high or low) and access to respite dialysis in home community. An independent statistician created the allocation schedule with a computerized random number generator and investigators are blind to this schedule. Participants are allocated to Early Treatment with MCP using the AIMhi App, Contact Control/Delayed treatment or Treatment as usual/Delayed treatment at a ratio of 1:1:0.5. Participants are assigned a Study ID following randomisation to ensure confidentiality.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par33">In addition to their allocated treatment below, all participants receive usual care from their renal service provider. The nature and extent of this care is monitored through file audits, to ensure no systematic difference between the treatment groups. Usual care is carried out according to the norms prevailing in the renal service and is informed by the needs of the client. Clinical files for each participant are carefully reviewed to examine the degree and nature of referrals or other treatment accessed over the study duration.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Either a phone (with credit) or $30 phone credit voucher is given to participants after completion of the baseline assessment and at each follow up assessment. All participants receive a text message or phone call at 10â€“11Â weeks and 21â€“22Â weeks post-baseline to remind them of the 3-month and 6-month assessments respectively (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>

Session 1 explores family, current strengths and worries. Participants are encouraged to set 1â€“2 goals that are achievable, meaningful, and practical for addressing an identified worry. The client-centred nature of the intervention ensures the goals are client driven and empowers them to take manageable steps toward achieving that goal. Session 2 reviews and refines the goals (identifies whether goals and steps were achieved) and helps clients address any barriers to goal attainment and set new goals as appropriate. Participants receive a text message or phone call 1Â week following the initial treatment reminding them of their goals and steps for making changes.</p>

The two 20-min sessions occur 2â€“4Â weeks apart and follow a similar format to the sessions received at baseline â€“ reviewing family, strengths, worries, previous goals and sets new goals. A text message or phone call is sent 1 week following the initial treatment to remind participants of their goals and steps for making change and the time for the next session.</p>

Session 1 of CC/DT goes through the structured Hep B App. Discussions specifically avoid review of family, strengths or individual goal setting. The participant interacts with the App with support from the researcher, and discussion focuses on navigation of the App and the App content. A â€˜goalâ€™ is agreed to talk to someone else in their family about the app content before the next session. A pictorial summary (utilising similar colours and images to the intervention summary) is given to the client. Session 2 reviews the information discussed in Session 1. This ensures each group receives the same contact time with researchers and interaction based on a structured App to aid participant blinding and to structure the control session. Participants receive a text message or phone call with a health tip linked with the health App in the intervening weeks.</p>

For the period July 2012â€“June 2013, the Australian Mental Health Outcomes and Classification Network (AMHOCN) reports mean K10 scores for â€˜ambulatoryâ€™ patients with mood disorders (i.e. outpatients returning to community after being treated acutely) across Australia of 27.6 (SDâ€‰=â€‰8.5) upon return to community, 22.0 (SDâ€‰=â€‰8.5) at 91-day review, and 18.4 (7.6) upon discharge from outpatient service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

              <p id="Par50">This project is expected to contribute much-needed evidence of effectiveness of wellbeing interventions for Indigenous people and demonstrate the benefits of providing such interventions to those with ESKD. It is the first randomised controlled trial to address both chronic disease and mental health in an Indigenous chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. It builds on an existing program of mental health research with demonstrated efficacy (AIMhi) to test the newly developed electronic motivational care planning therapy â€“ the AIMhi Stay Strong App, for improving psychological distress, depressive symptoms, quality of life and adherence to dialysis among Indigenous ESKD patients. Knowledge translation strategies include plans to conduct two implementation workshops with consumers and stakeholders following data collection and analysis to explore strategies for implementation. Results will also be communicated through publications, culturally adapted resources including posters and flyers. By working collaboratively with existing service providers, the project should improve their capacity to intervene early and translate the research outcomes into sustained clinical practice, leading to improved access to treatment and better clinical outcomes for an extremely vulnerable population.</p>
