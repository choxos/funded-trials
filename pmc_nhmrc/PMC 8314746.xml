                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>One in three people aged 65 years and over fall each year. The health, economic and personal impact of falls will grow substantially in the coming years due to population ageing. Developing and implementing cost-effective strategies to prevent falls and mobility problems among older people is therefore an urgent public health challenge. <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> is a low-cost, unsupervised, home-based balance exercise programme delivered through a computer or tablet. <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> has a simple user-interface that incorporates physical and behavioural elements designed to promote compliance. A large randomised controlled trial in 503 community-dwelling older people has shown that <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> is safe, has high adherence rates and is effective in improving balance and reducing falls. The current project targets a major need for older people and will address the final steps needed to scale this innovative technology for widespread use by older people across Australia and internationally.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This project will endeavour to recruit 300 participants across three sites in Australia and 100 participants in the UK. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> into the community and health service settings in Australia and the UK. The nested process evaluation will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore uptake and acceptability of the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme and associated resources. The primary outcome is participant adherence to the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme over 6 months.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Falls and fall-related injuries can lead to mobility-related disability and loss of independence in older people, causing both personal and community burden.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Falls are reported as the leading cause of injury-related hospitalisation in older people and the seventh-leading cause of all age disease burden in the western world.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This will result in increased demand for health services unless effective and cost-effective fall prevention strategies can be implemented.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> By 2051, the projected total annual Australian health bill for fall-related injury will reach $A1.4 billion, which will create demands on the health system that will be difficult to meet.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>There is clear evidence that falls in older people can be prevented with appropriately-designed exercise programmes. A Cochrane review concluded that exercise interventions are among the most effective strategies to reduce fall rates in community-dwelling older people.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, widespread implementation of exercise as a single intervention is a fall prevention priority. Well-designed exercise programmes, including moderate to high-intensity balance exercise of sufficiently high dose (2–3 hours per week) over periods of 6 months or more, can reduce falls by up to 39%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Despite strong evidence that falls can be prevented, older people and many health professionals are often not aware that exercise is an effective strategy for preventing falls.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 7–9</xref> Further, achieving a sufficient dose for fall prevention effects in clinical practice can be difficult to achieve.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> There is a clear gap between evidence and action.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>Worldwide, national policies have developed fall prevention action plans.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> However, currently there is limited access to fall prevention programmes and therefore an unmet need for delivering accessible, evidence-based fall prevention interventions to older people.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> Major shortcomings of many current programmes are that they are offered relatively short-term and lack long-term sustainability.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19 20</xref> Therefore, these programmes do not offer long-term protection from falls and/or functional decline. Novel methods for delivery of quality healthcare are required to ensure translation of effective, evidence-based fall prevention programmes while containing costs and using limited human resources to maximum effect.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The ultimate success of a health promotion programme depends on its effectiveness and its reach and acceptability in the community.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> is an engaging balance training programme that is designed specifically for use by older people. It employs technology to deliver an evidence-based, individually tailored exercise programme aimed at improving standing balance and reducing fall risk. The <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme includes behavioural change techniques to enhance exercise uptake and long-term adherence and is simple for older people to use independently at home.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> fills an important gap by giving older people the flexibility to exercise unsupervised at home and assists them to meet the required fall prevention exercise dose. While some people enjoy group exercise, some are unable (or unwilling<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) to attend centre-based activities, and many will need to supplement group exercise with home-based exercise to reach their fall prevention target dose.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> employs technology to provide an effective, long-term method for improving balance and reducing fall risk, using self-management and remote monitoring (adherence, exercise progression, exercise prescription). A large randomised controlled trial in 503 community-dwelling older people has shown that <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> is safe, has high adherence rates (median: 90 min/week over 6 months) and is effective in improving balance and reducing falls in older people.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> By combining technology with evidence-based practice, <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> will provide a novel solution to the fall epidemic by providing older people with an effective, sustainable, low cost and enjoyable exercise programme thereby supporting older people to remain active and independent.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
              <p>Understanding factors that may moderate real world uptake and adherence of <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> is key to its successful implementation on a broader scale. Process evaluation is a common tool used in pragmatic studies to assess the impact of intervention delivery and access within the study, as well as to gain understanding about how and why the intervention did or did not have its desired impact. The specific aims of this process evaluation are to investigate uptake and adherence to <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> by older people; examine how <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> is adopted by health professionals; and identify factors that will facilitate the embedding of <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> in usual care. While this implementation study was conceived before the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the delivery of falls prevention services in health and social care systems worldwide has been curtailed because of the need to reduce face-to-face contact. This has given rise to digital delivery of exercise programmes as they offer ways of delivering exercise regimens without, or with reduced, face-to-face contact.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref></p>

              <title>Methods and analysis</title>
              <p>This is an international, multisite, pragmatic clinical study with sites in Australia and the UK. The project focuses on implementing the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme across three partnering sites in Australia and one site in Northern England, UK. In Australia, two health districts in New South Wales (NSW; Mid-North Coast Local Health District and Northern NSW Local Health District) and one site in Victoria (Austin Health) are involved. In Northern England (UK), participants are recruited from Greater Manchester, North West Coast, Yorkshire and the Humber and the North East. Inherent to the study, is the creation of a website to guide the implementation (<ext-link xlink:href="www.standingtall.org.au" ext-link-type="uri">www.standingtall.org.au</ext-link>). The website provides information about the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme, training modules and resources, with the overall aim to educate older people and their families, as well as exercise therapists and other health professionals, on fall prevention and the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme. Website resources include knowledge quizzes with tailored education recommendations, evidence-based fact sheets, safety checklists, <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> training modules, manuals, frequently asked questions and blogs.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants are recruited through health services, community organisations and media advertisements. The study will involve consenting community-dwelling older people, aged 60 years or older with sufficient English language skills to understand study documents. Key exclusion criteria are: residents of aged care facilities; acute medical illnesses, severe psychiatric disorders, progressive neurological diseases including dementia; unstable medical conditions that preclude exercise participation; considered not suitable for study participation by referring family doctor or healthcare worker; have mobility limitations (unable to walk 10 m indoors without the use of a walking aid) and visual impairment that cannot be corrected with glasses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth set-ups have been introduced which require additional inclusion criteria. Participants are requested to have a support person present who lives in the same house, or is maintaining regular face-to-face contact with the participant, is currently well and can provide supervision and assistance if necessary. Participants who feel that a support person is unnecessary need to be able to step up a street curb without assistance (ie, without using their arms, walking aid or another person) to proceed with the telehealth set-up without a support person. Additionally, in the UK during COVID-19, potential participants who are familiar with strength and balance and known to services could elect to have a telephone setup. Potential participants unfamiliar with strength and balance exercises and who cannot be seen by the exercise specialist/relevant professionals in person or via telehealth will not be recruited until face-to-face becomes available. Participants are not restricted regarding concomitant care, interventions or activity.</p>

Exercises are delivered through on-screen animated instructions with video demonstrations and tips. The <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme delivers unsupervised and progressive balance exercises using digital technology (computer/tablet and internet). The <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme progresses the weekly exercise dose from 40 min in the first 2 weeks to 2 hours from week 9 onwards, through fortnightly 20 min increases. Exercise intensity is individually tailored using a modified perceived exertion 5-point Likert scale (1=unstable, 5=very stable). Exercise intensity rating modifies the exercises to ensure they are of moderate-to-high challenge and increases/maintains/decreases exercise intensity according to the user’s rating of ability. Participants can choose the timing and duration of their sessions.</p>

                <p>Online <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> training (including safety) is provided for participants, support persons and exercise specialists through the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> website. The training module includes a safety quiz, where an 80% pass mark is needed for participants and exercise specialists to receive access to the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme and content management system (CMS), respectively. Before commencing the exercise programme, participants are recommended to have a setup session with an exercise specialist (eg, physiotherapist, exercise physiologist, sports scientist, fitness leader or occupational therapist) with prior experience in delivering exercise to older people and who have completed the online training (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). This session can be face-to-face (as intended originally) or via telehealth/video conferencing (during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond) and is meant to familiarise the participant with the programme and its features, cover exercise safety and complete a balance assessment and a short exercise session. If at any point, the participant, support person or exercise specialist feel that the telehealth/video conferencing set-up is unsafe, the session will be abandoned until such time that additional safety measures can be implemented, or face-to-face contact can resume.</p>
                <p>The back-end (ie, the CMS) of the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme allows research staff and exercise specialists at the local health service level to remotely monitor exercise adherence and progression, as well as adjust exercise categories and intensity (if necessary, eg, in the case of illness or holidays). Participants are contacted by phone if their adherence drops below 85% for two consecutive weeks to discuss any problems or issues and to encourage adherence (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). If participants need programme support during their 6-month intervention period, they can contact a central study helpline and/or their exercise specialist.</p>

                <title>Programme logic model</title>
                <p>The study is conceptualised within a programme logic model, depicted in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>, which represents the theory of action or how the intervention contributes to a set of specific outcomes through a series of intermediate results. It is underpinned by a theory of change: Implementation and Knowledge Utilisation Theory. The logic model illustrates how different elements work together to create the desired change in target groups and achieve desired outcomes. Like all models it provides simplifications; the key is for the logic model to show the components of the programme that are thought to be critical for generating outcomes of interest to programme stakeholders. The approach used here is an ‘outcomes hierarchy’ approach to programme logic. Using this approach, every element of the model is written as an outcome and outcomes are connected. It shows the logical connections between inputs, outputs and outcomes using a type of ‘if-then’ logic. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the model inputs and how effective programme delivery will be achieved if these inputs are sufficient.</p>

                <p>There are three kinds of outcomes streams for <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic>—(1) outcomes for participating organisations, which are expected to contribute to increased system capacity to support falls prevention; (2) outcomes for study participants, which are expected to contribute to fewer falls among older people and (3) outcomes for health professionals, which are expected to contribute to more stakeholders recognising that exercise is key to falls prevention (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Outcomes are categorised as short (3–6 months), medium (12 months) and longer term.</p>
                <p>Short-term outcomes relate to adoption, appropriateness, acceptability, fidelity, coverage and feasibility (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Medium and long-term outcomes include fewer falls among older people and increased system capacity to support falls prevention, and relate to sustainability and implementation cost (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>The primary outcome for the study is adherence to the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme over 6 months (fidelity; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), measured as weekly training dose and total training dose recorded by the programme. The <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme records actual exercise minutes and does not include rests, watching instructional videos or setup for each exercise. Therefore, a 10 min session could take 20 min (or sometimes longer) depending on how many instructional videos the user watches and how many rests the user takes. Adherence data are automatically transferred to a secure server at Neuroscience Research Australia. Weekly exercise minutes (adherence) can be monitored in the CMS.</p>
                <p>Secondary process evaluation outcomes examine adoption, appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility, sustainability and implementation cost (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). The barriers/facilitators to telehealth/video conferencing delivery (because of COVID-19) will be explored as part of the evaluation.</p>
                <p>An adverse event is defined as an unwanted and unusually harmful outcome (eg, exercise-related fall, musculoskeletal injury or cardiovascular event). The event may or may not be related to the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme but is recorded if it occurs while the person is participating in the programme (ie, while they are doing <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> exercise activities). Adverse events are reported to the data monitoring committee and unexpected and serious adverse events are reported to the governing site and/or Research Ethics Committee (REC), as appropriate and in accordance with the local mandatory reporting policies. Annual reports are provided to the REC and governing sites.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>The primary analysis will estimate mean adherence, measured as minutes of exercise per week. With an SD of 43.1 min (estimated from an earlier trial<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), a sample size of 83 participants yield estimates of the mean with a CI width less than or equal to ±10 min in 80% of studies. To allow for an approximately 20% lost to follow-up, we will recruit 100 participants per site (Australia) or per region (UK).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The nested process evaluation will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore uptake and acceptability of the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme. Total exercise minutes and mean (95% CI) or median (IQR) weekly exercise minutes will be calculated from data recorded by the <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic> programme and will be reported as adherence (primary outcome). Number and proportions of responses to survey questions will be reported for the secondary outcome measures. Missing data will be left missing; no imputation methods will be used. Interviews will be audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis will identify patterns within and across study sites. A combination of inductive and deductive coding will be used—commencing with examination of barriers and facilitators, but open to unexpected findings that may contribute to these or other themes. A discrete choice experiment survey will examine the user’s preferences and acceptable trade-offs for aspects of <italic toggle="yes">StandingTall</italic>, including costs and other factors identified by qualitative interviews.</p>

              <p>Ethical approval and local governance approvals have been obtained (Lead ethics committee in Australia: South Eastern Sydney Local Health District, (HREC 18/288 approved 28/02/2019) and in the UK: North West-Greater Manchester South Research Ethics Committee (IRAS: 268 954 Approved 04/02/2020). All amendment requests will be submitted to these committees. Potential participants will provide verbal consent to be screened for eligibility (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Written informed consent, or during the COVID-19 pandemic informed online consent, will be obtained from all eligible participants by study staff prior to study enrolment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Participant confidentiality and privacy will always be maintained, and all data will be stored securely. Data access will only be provided to study staff and investigators. Health professionals, community referral agents and support persons will be emailed an invitation to complete an online survey. By completing the survey, consent will be implied to participate in the study when they click on the link. If health professionals, community referral agents and support persons are taking part in the interview or focus group sessions, then written informed consent or online informed consent (during the COVID-19 pandemic) will be obtained.</p>
              <p>Dissemination will be via publications, conferences, newsletter articles, talks to clinicians and consumers, and meetings with health department and health service mangers. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors recommended criteria for authorship on publications will be followed. Professional writers will not be used.
