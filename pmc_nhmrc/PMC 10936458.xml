                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>20 senior hospital staff took part. Barriers to hospital-level recruitment primarily related to perceptions of risk associated with not implementing CDS as a control site. Perceived risks included reductions in patient safety, reputational risk and increased likelihood that benefits would not be achieved following electronic medical record (EMR) implementation without CDS alerts in place. Senior staff recommended clear communication of trial information to all relevant stakeholders as a key strategy for boosting hospital-level participation in trials.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Hospital participation in controlled cluster trials of CDS is hindered by perceptions that adopting an EMR without CDS is risky for both patients and organisations. The improvements in safety expected to follow CDS implementation makes it challenging and counterintuitive for hospitals to implement EMR without incorporating CDS alerts for the purposes of a research trial. To counteract these barriers, clear communication regarding the evidence base and rationale for a controlled trial is needed.</p>

              <p>Controlled trials, where one cohort is exposed to an intervention and another cohort is not, are viewed as essential for determining effectiveness of an intervention. In trials of hospital-wide digital health interventions, such as electronic medical records (EMRs), delivery of the intervention to selected individuals or groups, such as clinicians or patients, risks contamination and is practicably difficult, so intervention delivery is typically at the site or hospital level.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In controlled cluster trials, individual participants are not recruited or consented but selected hospitals adopt a digital health intervention, while others refrain from or delay implementing the intervention during the data collection period.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Clinical decision support (CDS) alerts are viewed as a key safety feature of EMRs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> To date, however, few controlled trials have been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of alerts,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> and as a result, organisations have limited robust evidence to guide alert selection. For example, drug–drug interaction (DDI) alerts, which trigger at the point of medication order entry to warn prescribers of potentially dangerous drug combinations, are frequently used,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> yet no controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of DDI alert sets (eg, ‘severe’ or ‘moderate’ DDI alerts) to reduce medication errors and patient harms.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Our non-randomised controlled pre–post trial of DDI alerts in EMRs aimed to fill this evidence gap by comparing rates of DDIs and associated patient harms before and after implementation of an EMR, with (intervention) or without (control) DDI alerts.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We attempted to recruit six hospitals into our trial but encountered significant challenges in recruiting control hospitals. Hospitals were receptive to participating in a trial but were opposed to implementing their EMR system without DDI alerts in place, despite the limited evidence available on DDI alert effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Although there is considerable research exploring challenges associated with individual participant recruitment into trials,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref> much less is known about barriers and facilitators to site-level recruitment into controlled trials, and no previous research has examined site-level recruitment into trials of CDS. In the few studies that have examined hospital recruitment, most barriers identified relate to challenges associated with intervention delivery. For example, in a study that attempted to recruit nearly 100 hospitals for a pragmatic cluster randomised trial of postacute stroke services, the primary reason for hospitals declining to participate was insufficient staff or financial resources to deliver the intervention.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, for trials of CDS, such as DDI alerts, this factor is unlikely to be a barrier, as intervention delivery typically consists of ‘turning on’ the CDS functionality in an EMR with some additional clinician training on its use.</p>
              <p>In this study, we aimed to identify barriers to site-level participation in controlled cluster trials of CDS, and potential strategies for addressing these barriers. Based on the challenges we encountered in recruiting control sites for our trial, we expected to identify some unique recruitment challenges for trials of CDS. With the rapid acceleration of CDS implementation in hospitals, and digital health interventions more broadly, we hoped our findings would be of value to others attempting to generate a robust evidence base for these important interventions.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and participants</title>
                <p>Senior hospital staff from the six hospitals were purposively approached to take part in a qualitative interview to explore their views on evaluation of CDS alerts. Interviews formed part of our larger project focused on determining effectiveness of CDS alerts in EMR systems<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and were conducted after the commencement of our cluster trial but before trial completion. The sample included department directors, chief information officers and those working in health informatics teams. A snowball recruitment approach was also used to identify participants, where interviewees recommended additional colleagues to be interviewed. All participants provided written informed consent prior to commencing the interview. Participation was voluntary and no compensation was provided.</p>

                <p>As data collection occurred during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and across multiple states in Australia, semistructured interviews were conducted via videoconference. The interviewer was a human factors researcher with expertise in CDS evaluation and qualitative research (MTB). The interviewer was independent (ie, not employed or affiliated) from all study hospitals. Interviews comprised two parts: questions related to (1) recruitment of hospitals into trials of CDS and (2) evidence-based decision-making for selection and implementation of CDS and digital health interventions in general. Findings from the latter component were published previously,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and the former component is the focus of the current paper. The interview guide for component 1 appears in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 2</xref>. Participants were initially asked how and why their hospital decided to participate in the controlled trial of DDI alerts and then to reflect on barriers and facilitators to hospital participation in CDS trials more broadly.</p>

The three researchers came together to review codes, discuss discrepancies and agree on key themes for reporting. Any disagreements in themes identified were resolved via a discussion process. Data collection and analysis continued until inductive thematic saturation was achieved.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>In total, 34 potential participants were invited to take part in an interview and 20 participants agreed. This included 5 from QLD and 15 from NSW hospitals. Participants were chief information officers (n=2), directors of pharmacy, nursing or clinical pharmacology (n=7), EMR system implementation leads (n=4), director of clinical governance (n=1), directors of medical services (n=3) and chairs of relevant committees/councils (n=3). Each interview ran for an average of 30 min (range 17–55 min). Despite the range of expertise of participants, we found no major differences in the views expressed, so results are presented for all stakeholder groups together.</p>
              <p>All senior hospital staff recognised that a key benefit of a controlled trial was the generation of evidence on DDI alert effectiveness. However, participants identified a number of barriers or challenges associated with participating in the research as a control site. As shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, participants also proposed several strategies for addressing these barriers.</p>

                    <p>You’re at risk of nasty outcomes… there’s been some deaths because of interactions…I was involved in a statin-voriconazole death… an alert would have stopped that…if they read it. (site 2, participant 2)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>People explained that this risk to patients was primarily because doctors would assume that CDS alerts were operational, and so would not double check for DDIs. Some participants reported that end-users’ awareness of what alerts were operational in their EMR was poor, and this created a false sense of security.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>My concern about the system is always that the clinicians always assume that the system will tell them when they’re doing something wrong, and that it will inform them if there’s a problem. If they see any alert at all, then they know that the system’s watching out for them in some way. Their understanding of how much it watches out for them, obviously, is completely inaccurate. And that’s probably the biggest risk that I see of anything in the system, is that false sense of security. (site 1, participant 1)</p>

                  <p>With a transient workforce, participants were concerned that prescribers relocating from other districts would assume that DDI alerts were operational at control hospitals, as most other hospitals in Australia that used an EMR have DDI alerts.</p>

                  <disp-quote>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Participants referred to CDS alerts as a safety feature or intervention, and most assumed that alerts were effective in reducing patient harms. Interestingly, some participants alluded to alerts not being liked by end-users and many were aware of prescribers experiencing alert fatigue. Despite this, some senior hospital staff viewed removing DDI alerts as wrong because it constituted removing an effective safety intervention.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>What if the media got hold of this if someone was harmed, and they sued the hospital and it came out that we were participating in a trial, and elected not to turn on this safety feature… And we would not, they felt we would not have, I think that we wouldn't have a leg to stand on because we have got the functionality built in, but we didn't turn it on. (site 1, participant 4)</p>
                    <p>Look, I think one of the things that people look at is that they realize that even though they may not like it, the alert functionality is actually safer…if I turn that off, I've actually created an environment that’s actually going to put us back to causing harm… It’s a bit like turning all the features off on your car…so I take all the safety features off. I take all the beeps and all the other bits off the cameras. Why would I do that? (site 2, participant 5).</p>

                  <title>Effective communication</title>
                  <p>The mostly frequent strategy reported by participants to facilitate hospital recruitment as a control site was effective communication of trial information to the site, particularly to front-line clinicians, as end-users of CDS. Most senior staff who were also clinicians were not consulted as part of their site’s decision to participate in the research, and this was viewed as highly problematic.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>We needed much more engagement from all our clinicians… And indeed, not only communication, it’s actually that they're part of the decision making, to be engaged in such a project, which would mean that demonstrating the potential benefit would be very important. (site 3, participant 3)</p>
                    <p>I think, ultimately, the executives need to make the decision, but you definitely need input from the end users. Because as we all understand, the executives don't necessarily use the system and know how it impacts their workflow. So you would need advice or guidance from your end users. (site 5, participant 2)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>To avoid any misunderstanding, participants suggested that researchers directly communicate with clinicians about the trial, rather than information being delivered to front-line staff from executive teams. Trial information should include clear background and the rationale for the study, so that all stakeholders understand the current evidence base and why a controlled trial is needed.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>I think just kind of that discussion around “look, guys, you know how irritating these [alerts] are, we're not sure they're safe, so this is what we're thinking, and this is how we're going to measure it”. (site 3, participant 2)</p>
                    <p>Once I understood that basically there was equipoise between the two, that it probably didn't really matter which was the control arm and which was the treatment arm. (site 3, participant 5)</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This qualitative study revealed that hospital participation in controlled cluster trials of CDS is hindered by perceptions that adopting an EMR without CDS is risky for both patients and organisations. The allure of technology and the expected improvements in safety following CDS implementation are drivers for adopting an EMR, making it challenging and somewhat counterintuitive for hospitals to implement EMR without incorporating these safety features for the purposes of a research trial. Senior staff recommended clear communication of trial information to all relevant stakeholders as a key strategy for boosting hospital-level participation in trials.</p>
              <p>Previous research has shown that the primary reason for hospitals declining to participate in trials is limited resources to carry out the intervention,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> but this did not emerge as a result in our study. However, we uncovered similar concepts to those described in previous studies on individual recruitment into trials but found that these barriers manifested in a unique way for trials of CDS. For example, perceived risk of participation has been identified as a barrier to individual participant recruitment, with individuals less likely to take part in a trial if they perceive exposure to an experimental or untested intervention as too risky.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Risk emerged as a key theme in our results, however, we observed that the risks to patients, reputation and benefits realisation related to the absence of the intervention, not the intervention itself, reflecting participants’ underlying assumption that CDS alerts improve patient safety. Similarly, barriers related to the intervention in previous research typically relate to sites being unconvinced of the added value of an intervention, over and above usual care processes,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> however, we observed the reverse for CDS, with the value of CDS viewed as too great to participate in a trial as a control site.</p>
              <p>The perception that fewer alerts increase risk to patients, and concerns about the legal ramifications of this, have been identified as factors contributing to organisations overalerting users in EMRs.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This, and our findings, highlight the importance of consultation and clear communication between research teams and prospective organisations, particularly regarding the evidence base and rationale for controlled trials of CDS. Improved communication was the primary strategy proposed to boost hospital recruitment by participants in our study. This also aligns with a key facilitator to individual participant recruitment, as identified in previous research. Clear trial information delivered both face to face and in written format, by a trustworthy and knowledgeable individual with good communication skills, has been shown to increase individual participant recruitment into trials.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Implementation of CDS, like many digital health interventions, is often driven by the potential benefit achieved, rather than actual benefits demonstrated,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 23–26</xref> and increasing stakeholder awareness of this, and the equipoise that currently exists with respect to CDS effectiveness, may abate any major concerns held by both front-line clinicians and executive teams. We recommend engaging with organisations early and tailoring study information to highlight the potential benefits of trial participation to each user group. Understanding the needs and values of stakeholders is viewed as critical for successful recruitment into a trial.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A recent Delphi study recommended making clear to prospective participants not only the potential benefits and harms of trial participation but how these compare with what would happen if the participant did not take part in the trial.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

              <p>To minimise any risk to patients from the absence of CDS, participants suggested additional monitoring for adverse safety events by pharmacists and systems. Consistent with previous research,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> interviewees identified a risk of over-reliance on alerts by prescribers not being aware of which CDS functionalities are in place in the EMR. This study highlighted that this over-reliance is particularly a problem for controlled trials of CDS if a specific intervention is a frequently used form of CDS, like DDI alerts, or if the user has transferred from a different organisation, which is not uncommon. Ensuring end-users are aware of available CDS within an EMR, via good alert design (eg, visibility of available alerts in an EMR to end-users)<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and training, is critical for minimising inappropriate over-reliance on CDS.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study describes senior hospital staff’s perceptions of barriers to hospital recruitment. Not all participants were actively involved in their organisation’s decision to participate in our trial of DDI alerts. To preserve anonymity, limited demographic information was collected from participants, however, we acknowledge that some characteristics, like age and career experience, may have impacted the perceptions held and expressed by participants in this study. Complementing interviews with document review (eg, committee meeting decisions) and consultation with all stakeholders involved in trial participation decisions would strengthen these results and potentially identify other barriers to trial participation. Data were collected from senior staff at six Australian hospitals and findings may not be generalisable to other countries or stakeholders.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Barriers to hospital-level recruitment into controlled cluster trials of CDS related primarily to perceptions of risk associated with not implementing CDS as a control site. These perceived risks included reductions in patient safety, reputational risk and increased likelihood that benefits would not be realised following EMR implementation. To counteract these barriers, consultation and clear communication between research teams and prospective organisations are needed, particularly regarding the evidence base and rationale for conducting a controlled trial of CDS, and any ethical concerns surrounding trial participation.</p>
