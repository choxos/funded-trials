                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Children with cerebral palsy (CP) participate less in physical activities and have increased sedentary behaviour compared with typically developing peers. Participate CP is a participation-focused therapy intervention for children with CP with demonstrated efficacy in a phase II randomised controlled trial (RCT) to increase perceived performance of physical activity participation goals. This study will test the effectiveness of Participate CP in a multisite phase III RCT.</p>

                  <p>One hundred children with CP, aged 8â€“14 years, classified Gross Motor Function Classification System levels Iâ€“IV will be randomised to either (1) receive Participate CP once/week for 1â€‰hour for 12 weeks, or (2) waitlist control, usual care group. The waitlist group will then receive Participate CP following the 26-week retention time point. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and then 26 weeks post baseline. The primary outcomes are (1) self-reported participation goal performance on the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure at 12 weeks and (2) daily time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Secondary outcomes include home and community participation frequency, involvement and environmental supportiveness, contextual barriers to participation, quality of life, intrinsic motivation for physical activities, child perception of an autonomy-supportive climate for physical activities and physical literacy at 12 and 26 weeks post study entry.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In Australia, 35â€‰000 people are living with cerebral palsy (CP).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> People with CP have poorer health outcomes, are less physically active and have a 1.2-times to 1.6-times greater risk of chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and stroke compared with those without a disability.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> From as early as 3â€‰years of age, children with CP participate less in physically active leisure (eg, bicycle riding, team sports) compared with typically developing peers and participation reduces over time.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4â€“6</xref> Participation in physically active leisure is an important source of habitual physical activity (HPA) for children with CP.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Children with CP not only participate less often in physically active leisure (19% less likely to play sports or ride a bicycle),<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> but they participate with lower intensity,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and reduced diversity compared with their typically developing peers.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Owing to societal barriers, they are more likely to only have access to informal physical activities (eg, backyard games) than organised community sports (eg, swimming club).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Over and above their physical disability, children with CP experience more barriers to inclusion, including pain and fatigue, but also attitudinal and built-environment barriers.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11â€“14</xref> In a cross-sectional study of children and youth 5â€“17 years with (n=282) and without (n=294) disabilities, parents of children with disabilities reported that environmental factors (eg, physical access, attitudes of others, adequacy services, availability of equipment) consistently and directly influence involvement in and frequency of participation across home, school and community life.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Attitudes and the built-environment are modifiable treatment factors.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>Traditionally, therapy interventions for children with CP have targeted impairments (eg, spasticity) and activity limitations (eg, walking) with limited translation to enhanced participation in life roles (eg, mobility in all environments, education and leisure participation). Our systematic review<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> established that traditional interventions focusing on impairments and activity limitations are ineffective in improving participation in sports and other physical activities and overall physical activity levels. This highlighted that therapy models need to additionally consider contextual and environmental barriers in order to enable children to participate in their chosen leisure-time physical activities.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Potential barriers and facilitators to participation are individually unique and must be understood and targeted by intervention strategies in order to increase participation in physically active leisure and overall HPA.</p>
              <p>We developed Participate CP, a participation-focused therapy, that characterised physical activity as a health behaviour and was underpinned by theories of self-determination and behaviour change.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Participate CP is an 8-week, goal-directed, highly individualised and tailored intervention using a selection of behaviour change techniques guided by barriers to physically active leisure participation goals experienced by children and their families. In a phase II randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 37 children with CP, aged 8âˆ’12 years, classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Iâ€“III, children allocated to Participate CP, compared with usual care, had significantly greater gains in perceived performance of individualised participation goals on the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM, mean difference MD 3.6, 95%â€‰CI 2.2 to 5.0; p&lt;0.001) and reduced barriers to participation (MD 26.4, 95%â€‰CI 6.1 to 46.7; p=0.01). There were no between group differences on minutes per day spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), however for those participants not meeting physical activity guidelines at baseline, time spent in MVPA increased significantly by 6.0 (SD=12.2) min per day. The study, however, was not powered to determine a significant difference between groups for time spent in MVPA. Additionally, we found that 8â€‰weeks of intervention was not long enough to overcome barriers that were particularly related to sourcing equipment or funding to support sporting activities, therefore a longer intervention period may further enhance outcomes.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>We now aim to expand our work on Participate CP and conduct a phase III randomised waitlist-controlled trial with 100 children with CP, aged 8â€“14 years, GMFCS levels Iâ€“IV to determine if Participate CP is more effective than usual care to improve performance and satisfaction with individualised physically active leisure goals and daily time spent in MVPA.</p>

Cairns and the Hunter Valley represent two regional sites.

Participants will be excluded if the child has: (1) limited ability to communicate insight into preferred future (needs, wants, desires) in spoken English AND/OR through an interpreter or augmentative/alternative communication (ie, Communication Function Classification System Levels IVâ€“V), (2) significant intellectual disability (&lt;50), (3) uncontrolled epilepsy, (4) severe asthma exacerbated by exercise, not controlled with medication under an asthma management plan, (5) planned orthopaedic surgery 6 months prior to or throughout intervention/follow-up period, (6) was enrolled and previously received the intervention in the phase II study<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> in South-East Queensland (2016â€“2017).</p>

                <title>Random allocation and blinding</title>
                <p>A biostatistician not otherwise involved in participant contact, recruitment, assessment or intervention will create one central randomisation schedule using computer-generated random numbers (in random blocks of various sizes), to receive Participate CP immediately or to waitlist usual care in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will be stratified by site and GMFCS (I and II vs III and IV). The biostatistician will upload the randomisation schedule to an electronic database (Research Electronic Data Capture - REDCap)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> which will be used by study investigators to allocate participants using the randomisation module. Study staff are not able to access, view or download the schedule at any time. Group allocation will be concealed to the treating therapist, research team, the participant and their family until after all baseline measures (except 7-day accelerometry) are completed. Once randomisation is complete, it will be irrevocable.</p>
                <p>It is not possible to blind participants to which group they are allocated to (ie, treatment received) at T2â€“T3/T4. Therapists will not be aware of allocation until after all baseline assessments have been completed. Children and their caregivers complete questionnaires at home using REDCap and surveys are locked for editing after completion, so there is a reduced chance of therapist influence on these results. It is not possible to blind therapists to the treatment received at T2 and T3 for the main outcome (COPM) as it is an integral part of building rapport within the intervention and it is essential that the therapist who has been aware of the goal-progress to be the person who scores the goal collaboratively. Caregivers are blind to their previous COPM scores. Accelerometry data and physical literacy assessments will be blinded to the person analysing and scoring the data.</p>

                    <p>Participate CP is based on self-determination theory and conceptualises physical activity as a human health behaviour.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The hypothesised mechanism of action was supported by an analysis of predictors of the magnitude of response to the intervention.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We demonstrated that children who were more intrinsically motivated for physical activity at baseline had a greater response, and children who had an additional co-diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (and were therefore more likely to have extrinsic motivation for physical activity<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) had a reduced response to Participate CP compared with no diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Furthermore, a greater extent of overcoming barriers to participation during the intervention was associated with an increased response on both performance of physical activity goals and minutes per day MVPA.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Participate CP 2 has been optimised in response to these findings, with clinician training emphasising that moving children and families towards more intrinsic types of motivation is ideal, however recognising that it is natural for some children not to self-identify as being physically active and to require extrinsic motivation. In these cases, the clinician may consider careful application of behaviour change techniques involving rewards and incentives (which ordinarily are not recommended as they risk undermining intrinsic motivation).</p>

In a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation analysis, recognition accuracy for sedentary activities was 96%, 87% for standing utilitarian movements and 94% for comfortable or brisk paced walking. Model predictions will be mapped to traditional physical activity intensity categories as follows: sedentary windows were considered sedentary, standing utilitarian movement windows were considered light intensity physical activity and walking windows were considered MVPA.

                  <p>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is an objective method of quantifying goal attainment. Goals are scored on a Likert-type scale from âˆ’2 (representing no positive change at all from baseline/regression), âˆ’1 (a little less change than expected), 0 (attainment of goal at the expected level), +1 (a little more change than expected), to +2 (attainment of goal at much more than the expected level). Goals will be personally important to the individual (rather than standardised) with the distance between each increment representing a relatively equal amount of effort or improvement to achieve. Each GAS goal will describe a barrier to a primary COPM goal(s) at any level of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), or across any area of behaviour and motivation. Goals will be set collaboratively mid-intervention (rather than at the same time as COPM goals in the first session) as some change in goal content is expected due to the iterative nature of the process. As goal-setting forms an integral part of the intervention, the waitlist control group will not set GAS goals until they undertake their own intervention period and GAS scores will be analysed as paired samples (within groups).</p>

                <p>We will collect objective data on HPA, using the ActiGraph accelerometer device which is suitable for use with children. Four subjective measures will be collected from children and are appropriate to be used with children 8â€‰years and older. Three subjective measures will be collected from the childâ€™s primary caregiver. Screening measures will be collected from the childâ€™s primary caregiver which relate to personal, demographic and health information necessary for the conduct of the trial and data analysis. All data is re-identifiable. Data will be collected via paper forms, online survey platform (REDCap), devices (ActiGraph accelerometer and photo/video/audio recording devices) owned by sites/organisations (not personal devices). Data will be transferred securely in one of the following ways: (1) data collected on paper forms will be converted into an electronic format by the site therapist, forwarded using a secure file transfer service such as CloudStor and stored on the secure Queensland Cerebral Palsy Rehabilitation and Research Centre (QCPRRC) research server or uploaded directly to REDCap. Original paper files will be sent to QCPRRC via registered post or courier after being de-identified at the conclusion of the data collection phase; (2) data collected from devices will be downloaded by the site therapist, forwarded using a secure file transfer service and stored on the secure QCPRRC research server or uploaded directly to REDCap, then deleted. Data recorded on paper will be stored at the trial sites in locked filing cabinets during the data collection phase and within an archive box located in the locked filing cabinets of investigators in the Child Health Research Centre at South Brisbane Australia at the conclusion of the data collection phase. Data will be stored on secure Australian servers using REDCap (database) and the secure QCPRRC research server. Data will not be destroyed.</p>

                  <p>Analyses will follow standard principles for RCTs using two-group comparisons on all participants on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary comparison at 12â€‰weeks (T2 post) on COPM performance and satisfaction will be between treatment groups using linear regression with treatment group (Participate CP/waitlist control) included as the main effect and stratification factors as covariables. Effect estimates will be presented as mean difference and 95% CI. Secondary analyses will use similar methods to compare outcomes between groups at 12â€‰weeks for HPA level and sedentary behaviours, participation frequency, involvement and environmental supportiveness (PEM-CY) and self and parent-proxy reported quality of life (CP QOL Child). In cases where interval data cannot be transformed appropriately for regression analyses, non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney U) will be used for between-treatment comparisons. Recruitment bias will be assessed by comparing socio-demographic and clinical variables for consenters with non-consenters using t-tests (or Mann-Whitney U tests) for continuous variables and Ï‡<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables. Possible differential attrition will be assessed by comparing baseline characteristics of dropouts and continuing participants using t-tests (or Mann-Whitney U tests if appropriate) for continuous variables and Ï‡<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables. Sensitivity analyses of all outcomes will be conducted using multiple imputation techniques to investigate the effect of non-ignorable missing data during follow-up. For the PLAYfun, smallest detectable change, SE of measurement and intraclass correlation coefficients will be calculated for inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. Responsiveness will be assessed by comparing change scores (two-group comparison preâ€“post) to smallest detectable change.</p>

                  <p>By their nature, sports and active recreation activities may have small-to-moderate risks of injury associated with participation due to hazards present (some of which are integral parts of the activity and cannot be removed). There are also negligible to small risks of psychological harm associated with motivational interviewing/disclosure of personal/sensitive information. A risk assessment will be completed by the therapist in consultation with the childâ€™s parent/guardian and any relevant community members (such as coaches), prior to participation in activities considered to be high or extreme risk (eg, contact sports). High risk activities will require a documented risk assessment that is sent to the study coordinator.</p>

                <p>Ten parentâ€“child dyads were interviewed at the conclusion of the Participate CP pilot RCT and provided feedback on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention (Reedman S, ParticiPAte CP: a protocol of a randomised waitlist controlled trial of a motivational and behaviour change therapy intervention to increase physical activity through meaningful participation in children with CP). Parents and caregivers reflected that the intervention was highly feasible due to home and community visits during after-school hours, matched their needs well and was perceived to be highly effective. Their feedback was incorporated into the present trial design including: (1) increased emphasis on the social aspect of physical activity participation (encouraging participants to set some goals that involve participating in physical activities with others), and (2) increased length of the intervention to improve ability to address complex barriers. Patients and public were not otherwise involved in the design or conduct of this study. Participants and their families will be informed of progress and outcomes of this study via newsletter and conferences open to consumers.</p>

We hypothesise that the Participate CP intervention will lead to (1) significantly greater gains perceived performance and satisfaction with individualised physically active leisure participation goals, (2) increased daily time spent in MVPA, (3) increased home and community participation frequency and involvement, (4) increased home and community environmental supportiveness, (5) reduced number of contextual barriers to participation, (6) improved quality of life, (7) greater intrinsic motivation for physical activities, (8) increased child perception of an autonomy-supportive climate for physical activities (9) greater physical literacy immediately post intervention and retention at 26 weeks post baseline and (10) value for money for the health system.</p>
              <p>Based on results from our phase II RCT of Participate CP and incorporating consumer feedback, we have extended the intervention time from 8âˆ’12â€‰weeks in this current phase III trial. We have additionally added a measure of health literacy and health economic evaluation to understand the cost-effectiveness of Participate CP which will be important to inform implementation more broadly through the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme. As part of the fidelity framework for this study, we have developed standardised training and resources for interventionists which will provide a framework for later implementation of Participate CP into clinical practice should we find it is effective.</p>
              <p>One potential limitation of the study is the lack of blinding of outcome assessors. This was a pragmatic decision as primary outcome, the COPM is an integral component of the intervention and development of rapport between the child, family and interventionist. The second primary outcome, accelerometry data will be downloaded and analysed by ST who will be blinded to group allocation. Another limitation is that usual care will be highly variable and cannot be standardised as there are multiple service providers under pre-agreed funding packages through the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is possible that aspects of usual care may address participation goals. We will collect information from families on the therapies received by their child during the course of Participate CP so we can report usual care in as much detail as possible.</p>
              <p>The study has a number of strengths. The sample size has been calculated for the primary outcomes. The testing of Participate CP both in regional and metropolitan centres will increase the generalisation of findings to different environmental contexts. The inclusion of a health economic evaluation will inform policymakers of the cost, benefits of the intervention. It is recognised that participation and physical activity are of key importance to children with CP and their families,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> and there is currently a lack of high level studies focused on the effectiveness of interventions that specifically promote leisure participation. This study will address this evidence gap. We plan that results of this RCT will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences, relevant websites and through Facebook and other social media forums for youth with CP and their families.</p>
