                  <p id="Par4">Breastfeeding protects against a range of conditions in the infant, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), diarrhoea, respiratory infections and middle ear infections [1, 2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age, with continued breastfeeding recommended for at least two years and other complementary nutritious foods [3]. The 2017-18 National Health Survey (NHS) and 2018-19 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey (NATSIHS) reported that the proportion of breastfeeding in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants (0–2 years) were less than half that of non-Indigenous infants (21.2% vs. 45%, respectively)[4]. There is a lack of research on interventions supporting Aboriginal women to breastfeed, identifying an evaluation gap related to peer support interventions to encourage exclusive breastfeeding in Aboriginal women.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par8">We will evaluate the effect of scheduled breastfeeding peer support for and by Aboriginal women, on breastfeeding initiation and the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. This MRFF (Medical Research Future Fund) funded project is designed as a single-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial recruiting six sites across New South Wales, Australia, with three sites being randomised to employ a peer support worker or undertaking standard care. Forty pregnant women will be recruited each year from each of the six sites and will be surveyed during pregnancy, at six weeks, four and six months postnatally with a single text message at 12 months to ascertain breastfeeding rates. In-depth interviews via an Indigenous style of conversation and storytelling called ‘Yarning’ will be completed at pre- and post-intervention with five randomly recruited community members and five health professionals at each site” [5]. Yarns will be audio recorded, transcribed, coded and thematic analysis undertaken. Health economic analysis will be completed to assess the health system incremental cost and effects of the breastfeeding intervention relative to usual care.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>Evidence will be given on the effectiveness of Aboriginal peer support workers to promote the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding of Aboriginal babies. The findings of this study will provide evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of including peer support workers in postnatal care to promote breastfeeding practices.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par20">There is good evidence for including peer support interventions to support women’s decision to initiate breastfeeding and continue for a longer period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A Cochrane review of interventions to increase breastfeeding in infants born at term; had more than 83,246 mother-infant pairs from 73 studies that contributed data (58 individually-randomised trials and 15 cluster-randomised trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Overall, interventions increased exclusive breastfeeding rates and duration. Several factors that contributed to the successful interventions that encouraged exclusive breastfeeding included: advice offered as part of routine care by trained personnel during antenatal or postnatal care; ongoing scheduled visits; and advice that was tailored to the setting and needs of the specific population group. Other characteristics of successful strategies included interventions delivered with a face-to-face component, lay/ peer support, and a specific schedule of four to eight contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] identified that mixed mode interventions, combinations of face-to face and other media support, were effective when they start from pregnancy and continues to postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Support was more likely to be effective in settings that had already high breastfeeding initiation rates. One of the studies included in the Cochrane review, a cluster randomised controlled trial of motivational interviewing to extend the duration of lactation in 300 women in regional NSW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], showed a greater prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in the intervention group at four months (adjusted OR 1.88; 95%CI 1.01–3.50; p = 0.047). A rapid evidence review to inform the Australian Breastfeeding Strategy notes that evidence from the most recent comprehensive systematic reviews highlights that additional education or support for mothers of any kind within the healthcare system, compared with usual care, increases the likelihood of breastfeeding by 10–30%. Interventions that included peer counselling were more effective than those without peer counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies also confirmed that face-to-face care is more effective than other communication, for example printed materials. Nevertheless, interventions involving technology as an adjunct to other postnatal support have recently been found to increase exclusive breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par21">There is almost no research on interventions to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women to breastfeed, identifying an evaluation gap related to peer support interventions to encourage exclusive breastfeeding in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. There is a need for translational research and for capacity-building based on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of community-based social mobilisation and breastfeeding education activities. Our study addresses that evidence gap.</p>
                <p id="Par22">Successful breastfeeding interventions conducted in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in other countries include: peer counselling support, multifaceted components that are culturally appropriate; inclusion of social marketing techniques; provision of more baby-friendly healthcare services; inclusion of individual education and support; and targeting of family members including the grandmother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Australian, a review of current evidence points towards models of care that provide continuity of care, delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled organisations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health professionals and employed peer workers as most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par23">There is minimal published research internationally for the cost of peer support, or even professional support, for lactation support. In one trial, similar to our proposal, the FEeding Support Team (FEST), conducted a randomised, controlled feasibility trial of proactive and reactive telephone support for breastfeeding women living in disadvantaged areas in Scotland, with follow-up at six weeks. The incremental cost of providing proactive calls was £87 per additional woman breastfeeding and £91 per additional woman exclusively breastfeeding at 6–8 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

Following zero attendance at this lactation support group, we undertook a small qualitative research project (unpublished) to interview Aboriginal women with infants about the facilitators and barriers to breastfeeding. Women reported negative and positive feedback about their experiences related to breastfeeding advice that had been provided by health professionals. Some women found it difficult to access advice when they were experiencing difficulties with breastfeeding, including after-hours access for support. Women did not state that they were concerned about breastfeeding in public or about the effects of breastfeeding on their appearance. One participant noted that access to a face-to-face online resource was useful. However, most participants were unaware of this service, or reported that they could not afford to access a lactation consultant.</p>

                  <title>Sites/Setting</title>
                  <p id="Par32">The RCT will include six Aboriginal maternal and child health services in NSW (NSW Aboriginal Maternal and Infant Health Services, and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services).</p>
                  <p id="Par33">NSW was chosen as the geographical area to sample because Aboriginal women in NSW have the lowest initiation rates for breastfeeding and the highest decline in exclusive breastfeeding rates in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In NSW, much of the antenatal care for Aboriginal women is delivered through Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs) and through Aboriginal Maternal and Infant Health Service (AMIHS) via NSW Health. Some Aboriginal women access mainstream general practices, hospital antenatal clinics and private obstetricians. For the purpose of this study, we anticipate recruiting women attending antenatal care services that target Aboriginal communities specifically, including the maternal and child health services within the AMIHs network, which includes 40 services, as well as an independent community-controlled maternal and child health service. These services provide care to Aboriginal women, both antenatally and postnatally.</p>
                  <p id="Par34">Peer workers will be recruited at intervention sites, including via Aboriginal community networks. The workers will be employed by the University of Wollongong (UOW) but work within the partner organisations under a Memorandum of Understanding (prepared by the UOW legal team in conjunction with individual Local Health Districts or organisations), under the supervision of the UOW team.</p>
                  <p id="Par35">Participating sites will be offered compensation for involvement in the trial including funds for infrastructure support for the peer worker (including funding for fuel/ transport costs, and office infrastructure such as computer and phone). Sites are also offered funding to support workers including the peer worker and 1–2 other health care workers to attend annual training workshops/ seminars.</p>

                  <p id="Par65">We plan to recruit at least 360 participants and 306 participants completing 6 weeks in both of group 1 (intervention) and group 2 (control), with three sites in each group (120 participants and 102 completing 6 weeks per site assuming 15% drop out) providing 80.1% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.1500. The proportion in group 1 (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.2500 under the null hypothesis and 0.4000 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in group 2 (the control group) is 0.2500. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z-Test (Pooled), the intra-cluster correlation is 0.0100 and the significance level of the test is 0.050.</p>
                  <p id="Par66">At 6 weeks we expect a prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding to be 25% in the control group, based on breastfeeding prevalence of 26% seen at 6 weeks in the Gudaga study (Craig et al., 2011) while if effective we estimate prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in the intervention group to be 40% or more. A Cochrane review by McFadden et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported women in intervention groups were less likely to stop exclusive breastfeeding by 6 weeks (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89)., which applied to a base rate of 75% stopping breastfeeding leads to 15% higher absolute breastfeeding rates at 6 weeks (40% vs. 25%). However, we consider the current study intervention to be more intense than other studies included in that meta-analysis.</p>
                  <p id="Par67">Elliot-Rudder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] conducted a cluster RCT where health professionals were trained in motivational interviewing to support women to continue breastfeeding.
