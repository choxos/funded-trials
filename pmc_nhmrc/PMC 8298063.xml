                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Working in partnership with Indigenous communities in South Australia, we aimed to develop, pilot test and estimate utility scores for health states relating to cervical cancer screening, precancer, and invasive cervical cancer and precancer/cancer treatment among Indigenous women.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Development and pilot testing of hypothetical cervical cancer health states, specifically through the lens of being an Indigenous Australian woman, was done with an Indigenous Reference Group in conjunction with five female Indigenous community members. Six health states were developed. These included: (1) Screened: cytology normal; (2) human papillomaviruses (HPV) positive with cytology normal; (3) low grade cytology (LSIL);(4) high grade cytology (HSIL); (5) early stage cervical cancer and; (6) later stage cervical cancer. Utility scores were calculated using a two-stage standard gamble approach among a large cohort of Indigenous Australian women taking part in a broader study involving oral HPV infection. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the rank, percentage of respondents with a utility = 1 (perfect health) and utility score of each health state was summarised. Mean (SD) and medians and inter-quartile range (IQR) over 12 months and lifetime duration were calculated. Potential differences by age and residential location were assessed using the Wilcox Sum Rank test.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Data was obtained from 513 Indigenous women aged 19+ years. Mean utility scores were higher for the four non-cancer health states than for invasive cervical cancer states (p-values &lt;0.05). Lower mean utility scores were observed for late stage cervical cancer, with 0.69 at 12 months and 0.70 for lifetime duration (Intra-class correlation coefficients = 0.425). Higher utility scores were observed for the four non-cancer health states among non-metropolitan participants (ranged from 0.93 to 0.98) compared with metropolitan participants (ranged from 0.86 to 0.93) (p-values&lt;0.05).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Among a large cohort of Indigenous Australian women, the reduction in quality of life (which utilities reflect) was perceived to be greater with increasing severity of cervical cancer health states. There were differences observed by geographic location, with positive cervical screening and precursor cancer-related quality of life being much higher among non-metropolitan-dwelling participants. These utility values, from one of the largest such studies ever performed in any population will be uniquely able to inform modelled evaluations of the benefits and costs of cervical cancer prevention interventions in Indigenous women.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer among women globally [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is one of the major gynaecologic malignancies that threatens women’s health and quality of life. The 5-year relative cervical cancer survival rate is generally higher in developed countries, including the United Kingdom (63.8%), Australia (67.1%), Denmark (69.5%) and Japan (71.4%) [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] than in developing countries such as India (35%-60%), Chile (50.9%), South Africa (54.9%) and Brazil (61.1%) [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the vast majority of cases, cervical cancer, is caused by associated by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease through early and regular cervical screening (Pap Smears), HPV vaccination and timely treatment of precancerous lesions [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to lower levels of access to these proven interventions, in many high-income countries Indigenous women have a higher morbidity and mortality rate of cervical cancer than non-Indigenous women [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Indigenous women in Australia are those identifying as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Indigenous women constitute approximately 3.2% of the total female Australian population according to the Australian Census 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While the incidence rate of cervical cancer decreased from 18 to 7 per 10,000 Australian women between 1990 and 2015, and Indigenous women had 2.5 times higher (22.2 per 10,000 women) the incidence rate and 3 times higher mortality rate than non-Indigenous women aged 20–69 years between 2011–2015 [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These differences are likely to be due, in part, lower access to cervical cancer screening and vaccination among Indigenous women [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>Prevention of diseases is an effective way of reducing the burden of cervical cancer over the long term. Australia’s National Cervical Screening Program was established in 1991 and renewed in 2017 (including renew cervical screening from 2 to 5 years, age-range from 25 to 74 years old, and self-collection of a vaginal sample based on primary test for oncogenic type of HPV [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with the HPV vaccination via school-based immunisation program introduced for girls in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In general terms, evaluation of the benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of strategies for primary and secondary cancer prevention require an understanding of health state utilities. Health state utilities capture a given population’s preferences for a range of health states. Although cervical cancer health state utilities have been assessed in several populations [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the development of appropriate descriptions of the associated health states and their assessment in Indigenous women, in Australia or any other country, has not been described. The aims of this study were to thus, in partnership with Indigenous communities in South Australia, develop, pilot test and estimate utility scores for health states relating to cervical cancer screening, precursor cervical cancer, established cervical cancer and its treatment among Indigenous women aged 18 years and over.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This study developed six hypothetical health states from ten cervical cancer health states, then conducted pilot testing. A two-stage standard gamble (SG) approach was used to assess the health states. SG is grounded in expected utility theory, and often viewed as a gold standard to measure health utility [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="sec007">
                <title>Health state development</title>
                <p>In partnership with the study’s Indigenous Reference Group (IRG), which comprised several respected Indigenous adults with diverse backgrounds from across South Australia, ten hypothetical cervical cancer prevention and treatment health state scenarios were developed. The scenario descriptions were informed by relevant Australian cervical cancer screening and treatment guidelines, including the psychosocial literature in relation to Indigenous health, and incorporated the feedback from the IRG [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Domains that the IRG identified as being of fundamental importance in the health state preferences included: 1) racism/distrust/confusion of health sector (with anticipation of racism being very strong); 2) connection/responsibilities to family; 3) social determinants of health uniquely over represented in many Indigenous families (death, incarceration, child removal from family by state, poverty, domestic violence, addictions, food insecurity, loss and grief, hum-bugging (concept of ‘what’s yours is mine’); 4) connections with country (especially for remote-dwelling participants) and; 5) spiritual thought processes; acceptance that sickness is their lot, accepting cancer is being ‘sung to death’; going to the ancestors. The ten hypothetical health states included: 1) pap smear cytology normal; 2) HPV vaccination; 3) low-grade cytology; 4) low-grade cytology with colposcopy normal; 5) HPV positive with cytology normal; 6) HPV positive with colposcopy normal; 7) treated genital warts; 8) high grade cytology with histologically-confirmed Grade I cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; 9) high grade cytology with histologically-confirmed Grade II/III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and; 10) early stage cervical cancer. After pilot testing, it became apparent that the burden of valuing 10 health states in terms of the time taken to complete with a two-stage standard gamble was significant. The number of health states was thus reduced to six (<xref rid="pone.0254575.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>): 1) Screened: cytology normal; 2) HPV-positive with cytology normal; 3) low grade cytology; 4) high grade cytology; 5) early grade cervical cancer and; 6) late stage cervical cancer.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>The IRG considered it imperative to hire and train research officers who were able to respectfully engage in, and be responsive to, the cultural values of participants, so that participants felt comfortable during the interview and to ensure interviewer consistency. This was achieved by the IRG being actively involved in the recruitment and training of research officers. Valuations of the six health states were collected from 513 female Indigenous Australians aged 19+ (ranging from 19 to 78) years, residing in South Australia and taking part in a wider study examining oral HPV infection and oropharyngeal cancer in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Participants had been initially recruited through Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs), who were key stakeholders in the study between Feb 2018 and January 2019 [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Data for the cervical cancer health state utilities was collected during the parent study’s 12-month follow-up (suspended early because of covid-19 restrictions) from February 2019 to March 2020. Participants not enrolled during the original recruitment period will not be eligible to participate in the follow-up phases.</p>

                  <p>Data from the six hypothetical HPV-related cervical cancer health states were collected via face-to-face interviews by trained research officers. Each scenario was described in a narrative format with the use of visual prompts and aids. Participants were invited to ask as many questions as they liked for clarification purposes. Participants were then asked to rank the description of each health state relative to the others, from one to six (one being most desirable, six being least desirable; equal ranking was accepted). At no stage were participants asked if they, or anyone they knew, had experienced any of the health states. The participant interviews averaged one hour in duration (ranging from 45 minutes to one hour 20 minutes).

                  <p>A two-stage standard gamble approach (<xref rid="pone.0254575.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) was utilised [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This was to enable a ‘disutility’ of a health state to be calculated by observing an individual’s willingness to accept a certain risk of death in order to avoid the state. Participants were asked to imagine the five-temporary health states (from non-cancer to early cervical cancer) returning to full health after 12 months (Stage 1). For the late stage cervical cancer health state, where the probability of indifference between living with late stage cervical cancer is measured relative to the risky prospects associated with either perfect health or immediate death (Stage 2), two ‘time in state’ durations were used. The first was for 12 months followed by sudden and painless death, the second was from the present until age 85 years, followed by sudden and painless death. Participants therefore provided seven health state preference scores; five for each temporary health state and two for late stage cervical cancer.</p>

                <p>Demographic characteristics were described by number and percentage. Each health state was ranked, with the percentage of perfect health at 12 months estimated. The utility score of each health state was summarised using means and standard deviation (SD), as well as medians and inter-quartile range (IQR).

Utility scores transformed with ‘12 month’ and ‘lifetime’ durations were analysed separately for each demographic outcome.

Mean utility scores were higher for the four non-cancer health states than for ‘early and late stage cervical cancer’ (‘0.89–0.98’ vs ‘0.69–0.84’). Lower mean utility scores were observed for ‘late stage cervical cancer’ with 0.69 at 12 months and 0.70 for lifetime duration. Meanwhile, the interquartile range for the four non-cancer and early stage cervical cancer health states was ‘1.00 to 1.00’ when anchored to both 12-month and lifetime duration, compared with, for ‘late stage cervical cancer’, 0.00–1.00 for both 12-month and lifetime duration. This indicated heterogeneity in the valuation of late stage cervical cancer compared to other health states.</p>

              <p>Working in partnership with Indigenous communities in South Australia, this is the first study to develop, pilot test and estimate utility values for hypothetical cervical cancer health states from the perspectives of Indigenous Australian women. These utility values, from one of the largest such studies ever performed in any population will be uniquely able to inform modelled evaluations of the benefits and costs of cervical cancer prevention interventions in Indigenous women. Our findings demonstrated that both early and late cervical cancer health states were associated with lower utility scores, irrespective of the length of duration of the anchor state, compared with the four other non-cancer health states. The positive impact of hypothetical cervical screening and precursor cervical cancer on quality of life were much greater for Indigenous women living in non-metropolitan areas compared to those in metropolitan locations. Our findings indicate broadly lower utility scores for cervical cancer screening, abnormalities and cervical cancer health states among Indigenous Australian women compared with general population estimates of non-Indigenous Australian women [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Cervical cancer screening is an important and cost-effective strategy of reducing the prevalence and severity of cervical cancer. Comparing with a similar predicate study [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] with 10 cervical cancer health status among all Australian population, our findings suggest that Indigenous women may be less likely to participate in screening (Utility score: 0.95) than non-Indigenous women (Utility score: 0.99) in Australia. The trend of cervical cancer screening in our study is consistent with other practical studies in Indigenous populations at a global level, such as the First Nations people in Canada [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the Indigenous Peruvian women in Peru [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and American Indian women in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Negative attitudes about cancer treatment lead to decreased survival of cervical cancer [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our findings indicated that Indigenous women had lower utility scores for early- (0.83–0.84), and late-stage cervical cancer (0.69–0.70) than their non-Indigenous counterparts (0.97–0.99) [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] at both 12-months and lifetime duration. The findings are similar to a study involving American Indian women, who had a lower cancer survival rate than white women due to lower level of basic cancer screening knowledge and more negative attitudes about cancer treatment [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>It is interesting that higher scores were observed for the four non-cancer health states among non-metropolitan Indigenous women in our study (utility scores ranged from 0.93 to 0.98), compared with metropolitan participants (utility scores ranged from 0.86 to 0.93). The findings are certainly contrary to other cancer estimates among Indigenous populations in Australia, where higher burden of cancer and lower cervical screening are evidenced among those living in regional or remote locations compared to those living in urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254575.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, a current study [<xref rid="pone.0254575.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] has shown that the proportion of women cervical cancer screening was higher for the Indigenous Primary Health Care (PHC) centres in the very remote areas than for centres in other areas. Our findings may associate with the utility of specific models that PHC centres in very remote areas have implemented in order to improve quality of life.</p>
              <p>The strengths of this study include: 1) the extensive development, pilot testing and refinement of the health states conducted through an Indigenous Reference Group. This is considered essential in any stage of developing tools for use with and by Indigenous Australians; 2) the health states were then tested in a large sample of Indigenous South Australian women. The study had extremely good Indigenous community buy-in, with some participants going to considerable length to contact the research team to enquire what they needed to do to be involved; 3) a two-stage standard gamble approach was used to yield helpful data for cost effective and health economic analysis. Limitations include participants being based in South Australia only, meaning the findings may not be generalisable to the many other culturally and linguistically diverse Indigenous groups elsewhere in Australia. The findings, for the same reason, may also not be generalisable to other Indigenous groups in the world.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>We used culturally respectful processes to develop six cervical cancer health states representing cervical screening, HPV infection, screen-detected abnormalities, and early and late cervical cancer from the perspective of Indigenous Australian women. The reduction in quality of life was perceived to be greater with increasing severity of health states. There were differences observed by geographic location, with positive cervical screening and precursor cancer-related quality of life being much higher among non-metropolitan participants. Our findings are an important contribution to cost-utility and disease prevention strategies that seek to inform policies around reducing HPV infection and cervical cancer among all Australian women. The information could be used to directly calculate quality-adjusted life years and to, in turn, be translated into health policy regarding Indigenous patient journeys with primary and secondary prevention for HPV-related cervical cancer.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Ju,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Mar 04 2021 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>

              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>

              <p>Academic Editor</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Journal Requirements:</p>
              <p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
              <p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
              <p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>2. Data availability. Please note that PLOS journals require authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception. Unfortunately, your statement that "No- some restrictions will apply", is not in accordance with PLOS data availability policy. PLOS requires that a “minimal data set” is shared, defined as the data set used to reach the conclusions drawn in the manuscript with related metadata and methods, and any additional data required to replicate the reported study findings in their entirety. Authors do not need to submit their entire data set if only a portion of the data were used in the reported study. Also, authors do not need to submit the raw data collected during an investigation if the standard in the field is to share data that have been processed. Please submit the following data: The values behind the means, standard deviations and other measures reported; The values used to build graphs; The points extracted from images for analysis.” <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-faqs-for-data-policy" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-faqs-for-data-policy</ext-link>. If you are unable to share the data, this may result in manuscript rejection.</p>
              <p>3. We note that you have indicated that data from this study are available upon request. PLOS only allows data to be available upon request if there are legal or ethical restrictions on sharing data publicly. For information on unacceptable data access restrictions, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>In your revised cover letter, please address the following prompts:</p>
              <p>a) If there are ethical or legal restrictions on sharing a de-identified data set, please explain them in detail (e.g., data contain potentially identifying or sensitive patient information) and who has imposed them (e.g., an ethics committee). Please also provide contact information for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent.</p>
              <p>b) If there are no restrictions, please upload the minimal anonymized data set necessary to replicate your study findings as either Supporting Information files or to a stable, public repository and provide us with the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers. Please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long</ext-link> for guidelines on how to de-identify and prepare clinical data for publication. For a list of acceptable repositories, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We will update your Data Availability statement on your behalf to reflect the information you provide.</p>

              <p>1. Abstract: in results part should be added the statistical tests results in addition to description presentation.</p>
              <p>Thank you. We added the statistical tests results, such as p-values and Intra-class correlation coefficients, in the Results section (line 53-58, page 4).</p>
              <p>2. Methods: It should be explained why among the health utility measurement instruments; the single measurement instrument is chosen and why Standard Gamble is preferred in this study instead of other instruments.</p>
              <p>We added a sentence to explain why the ‘Standard Gamble’ as a single measurement instrument was chosen:</p>
              <p>1) ‘Standard Gamble is grounded in expected utility theory, and often viewed as a gold standard to measure health utility.’ (line 113-115, page 6). </p>
              <p>3. Methods: What are the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study participants?</p>
              <p>We added sentences to introduce the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study participants:</p>
              <p>1) ‘Valuations of the six health states were collected from 513 female Indigenous Australians aged 19+ (ranging from 19 to 78) years, residing in South Australia and taking part in a wider study examining oral HPV infection and oropharyngeal cancer in Australia.’ (line 147-150, page 8).</p>
              <p>2) ‘Participants not enrolled during the original recruitment period will not be eligible to participate in the follow-up phases.’ (line 155-156, page 8).</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: I do not have the expertise to judge the specific tools used for this study however I note that the study has followed proper process for engaging with Indigenous populations, which speaks to its success overall. I felt it read clearly and logically and only have minor comments/corrections.</p>
              <p>Comment:</p>
              <p>Short title: Needs to include the word 'Indigenous' as that is a major focus</p>
              <p>Minor corrections:</p>
              <p>Line 105:take out one ‘in’ before Indigenous</p>
              <p>Line 112: should the word ‘status’ actually be ‘states’ (appears twice in this line)</p>
              <p>Line 113: change conduced to ‘conducted’</p>
              <p>Line 198: separates should be ‘separate’ (singular)</p>
              <p>Line 282: “each health state” not states</p>
              <p>Line 328: add word to after similar- “similar to a study”</p>
              <p>Line 360: Indigenous Australian women (no ‘s’ necessary on Australian)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: The authors have addressed a significant area of research and this article will contribute significantly towards the existing literature for cervical cancer prevention program evaluation with regards to health services uptake among indigenous communities in Australia. Yet there are some points that need to be considered:</p>
              <p>1) Minor confusion exists in the abstract (Methods) line 40-41. Difference is not obvious between health states 2 and 3. Whereas it has been clearly indicated between S2 (HPV positive with cytology normal) and S3 (Low grade cytology) in the results section.</p>
              <p>2) The introduction section effectively gives the background of the research problem but careful proofreading would be beneficial for language errors. Similarly the discussion section has discussed the results in comparison to previous studies, yet some language errors are present.</p>
              <p>3) In the data collection section, the study referenced for description of sample size (19) does not explain the participants. The references need to be rearranged correctly.</p>
              <p>4) Statistical analytical techniques used are adequate, tables have been formed precisely and the main findings reported appropriately. However with my limited expertise in the field of Health Economics, I am unable to advise much.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: All comments have been addressed</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: </p>
              <p>1. I do not have the expertise to judge the specific tools used for this study however I note that the study has followed proper process for engaging with Indigenous populations, which speaks to its success overall. </p>
              <p>We appreciate this comment, thank you.</p>
              <p>2. I felt it read clearly and logically and only have minor comments/corrections:</p>
              <p>1). Short title: Needs to include the word 'Indigenous' as that is a major focus</p>
              <p>We have changed short title to: ‘Utility scores for HPV infection and cervical squamous cell carcinoma among Australian Indigenous women’</p>
              <p>2) corrections:</p>
              <p>(1). Line 105: take out one ‘in’ before Indigenous</p>
              <p>We have deleted ‘in’ (Line 105, page 6).</p>
              <p>(2) Line 112: should the word ‘status’ actually be ‘states’ (appears twice in this line)</p>
              <p>Thanks. We have changed the word ‘status’ to ‘states’ (Line 113-115, page 6)</p>
              <p>(3) Line 113: change conduced to ‘conducted’</p>
              <p>We have changed the word ‘conduced’ to ‘conducted’ (Line 113, page 6)</p>
              <p>(4) Line 198: separates should be ‘separate’ (singular)</p>
              <p>We have changed the ward ‘separates’ to ‘separate’ (Line 198, page 10)</p>
              <p>(5) Line 282: “each health state” not states</p>
              <p>We have deleted ‘s’ (Line 282, page 15)</p>
              <p>(6) Line 328: add word to after similar- “similar to a study”</p>
              <p>We have added a word ‘to’ (Line 328, page 17)</p>
              <p>(7) Line 360: Indigenous Australian women (no ‘s’ necessary on Australian)</p>
              <p>We have deleted ‘s’ (Line 361, page 18)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: </p>
              <p>The authors have addressed a significant area of research and this article will contribute significantly towards the existing literature for cervical cancer prevention program evaluation with regards to health services uptake among indigenous communities in Australia. Yet there are some points that need to be considered:</p>
              <p>1) Minor confusion exists in the abstract (Methods) line 40-41. Difference is not obvious between health states 2 and 3. Whereas it has been clearly indicated between S2 (HPV positive with cytology normal) and S3 (Low grade cytology) in the results section.</p>
              <p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. Health state 2 (S2) should be ‘HPV-positive with cytology normal’. We have corrected it in Abstract and Methods sections (Line 41, page 3; and Line 140, page 7)</p>
              <p>2) The introduction section effectively gives the background of the research problem but careful proofreading would be beneficial for language errors. Similarly the discussion section has discussed the results in comparison to previous studies, yet some language errors are present.</p>
              <p>Thanks. We have corrected language errors:</p>
              <p>(1). We deleted the word ‘in’ (Line 105, page 6)</p>
              <p>(2). We added the word ‘to’ in the sentence ‘The findings are similar a study….’ (Line 329, page 17)</p>
              <p>3) In the data collection section, the study referenced for description of sample size (19) does not explain the participants. The references need to be rearranged correctly.</p>
              <p>We have rearranged references (Line 150, page 8)</p>
              <p>4) Statistical analytical techniques used are adequate, tables have been formed precisely and the main findings reported appropriately. However, with my limited expertise in the field of Health Economics, I am unable to advise much.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
