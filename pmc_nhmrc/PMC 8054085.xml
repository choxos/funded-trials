                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are vital for the delivery of medical therapies, but up to 30% of PICCs are associated with complications such as deep vein thrombosis or infection. The integration of antimicrobial and hydrophobic catheter materials, and pressure-activated valves, into polyurethane PICCs are innovations designed to prevent infective and/or thrombotic complications.</p>

                  <p>A multicentre, parallel group, superiority randomised controlled trial with two experimental arms ((1) hydrophobic PICC (with pressure-activated valve); (2) chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated PICC (with external clamp)) and one control group ((3) conventional polyurethane PICC (with external clamp)). Recruitment of 1098 adult and paediatric patients will take place over 2 years at three tertiary-referral hospitals in Queensland, Australia. Patients are eligible for inclusion if their PICC is to be inserted for medical treatment, with a vascular size sufficient to support a 4-Fr PICC or larger, and with informed consent. The primary outcome is <italic>PICC failure</italic>, a composite of thrombotic (venous thrombosis, breakage and occlusion) and infective complications (PICC-associated bloodstream infection and local infection). Secondary outcomes include: all-cause PICC complication; thrombotic complications; infective complications; adverse events (local or systemic reaction); PICC dwell time; patient/parent satisfaction; and healthcare costs. Differences between both intervention groups and the control group will be compared using Cox proportional hazards regression. Effect estimates will be presented as HRs with corresponding 95% CI.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are inserted via deep peripheral veins, predominantly of the upper arm, into the central vasculature.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> PICCs are vital for many acute and chronic diagnoses requiring prolonged and/or frequent therapy, vesicant medications, irritant pH and osmolality infusions, for patients with limited veins in both outpatient and inpatient settings.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The last 40 years have seen rapid acceleration in PICC use, due to their relative safety, ease of use and cost-effectiveness compared with more invasive centrally inserted devices. However, it is now established that PICC-related complications are universally common, with up to 30% of PICCs failing prior to completion of treatment due to thrombotic (eg, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)) and infective complications (eg, catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CABSI) including those caused by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> Innovations that prevent these complications are necessary to reduce healthcare-associated harm for vulnerable patients.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>PICC materials</title>
                <p>Integrating antithrombotic and anti-infective technologies into the PICC materials are potential innovations to prevent complications. Several PICC materials have been developed since their inception in the 1970s<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; however, the majority of PICCs currently in use are made of relatively stiff, third-generation uncoated polyurethane that softens with body temperature and withstands pressures of &gt;300 pounds per square inch.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
                <p>Material technologies introduce antithrombotic and anti-infective properties in PICCs, with two major products entering the market over the last 5–10 years. The BioFlo PICC from AngioDynamics Inc (Queensbury, New York, USA) has hydrophobic (water repelling) properties, which has been achieved by the addition of ‘Endexo’ (a surface-modifying macromolecule based on the incorporation of fluorine atoms) during the moulding manufacture process. The fluorinated PICC material inhibits platelet adhesion, suppresses protein procoagulant conformation and potentially reduces thrombus formation in medical devices (based on platelet counts in manufacturer completed in vitro studies only).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Our pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) in a paediatric population (n=150) demonstrated the feasibility and potential for the hydrophobic BioFlo PICC to reduce PICC thrombotic and infective complications, but the study was not powered for clinical effectiveness (PICC failure: standard polyurethane 22% (16/72)) vs BioFlo 11% (8/72): risk ratio (RR) 0.50; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.09; p=0.07).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
                <p>Anti-infective properties impregnated into PICCs include antibiotics (eg, minocycline-rifampicin) and antiseptics (eg, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)). These technologies have been well studied in other central venous catheter types, with a Cochrane review<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> concluding there was high-quality evidence that antimicrobial (non-PICC) central venous catheters significantly reduced CABSI risk (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.74, n=10 405, 42 RCTs). Building on this indication, Teleflex Inc (Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA) developed the CHG-impregnated Arrowg+ard Blue Advance PICC. CHG is widely used in healthcare, due to its broad spectrum of germicidal activity against most CABSI-causing pathogens, especially <italic>S. aureus</italic>.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Some manufacturer-funded, laboratory studies also suggest CHG coating has a role in the prevention of thrombosis development, with in vivo ovine models demonstrating a significant reduction in fibrin sheath development after 30 days in situ, in comparison with uncoated catheters (median 0.05 g (CHG) vs 0.7 g (uncoated)).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, the effectiveness of CHG-coated PICCs to prevent thrombotic and infective complications has not been formally tested in clinical trials in humans.</p>

              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>PICC designs</title>
                <p>PICC design evolution has primarily focused on the integration of internal valves, replacing external clamps, with the aim of preventing thrombotic occlusion by reducing blood reflux.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> External clamps prevent gravity and pressure-related backflow of blood into and out of the PICC when not in use. Modern pressure-activated valves, such as those incorporated in the BioFlo PICC from AngioDynamics Inc (Queensbury, New York, USA), negate the need for external, clinician-initiated clamping during periods of disuse. The valves are incorporated at either the distal or proximal portion of the PICC and open with injection and aspiration pressure but remain closed during minor pressure fluctuations.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Despite the integration of valves into many PICCs, data regarding their performance in preventing complications in clinical trials are minimal. Only one RCT (n=180) of the pressure activated valve versus older PICC valve technologies has been published, and this RCT was stopped early due to safety concerns with an older valve (Becton Dickinson – Bard, Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
                <p>The ideal PICC would be: (A) soft and flexible to reduce procedural risks (including ease of insertion, patient discomfort and vessel irritation); (B) structurally strong to withstand pressure during rapid injection; (C) prevent microbial colonisation and adherence of blood components to reduce CABSI and DVT; and (D) cost-effective. Little research has been undertaken examining the safety and effectiveness of either hydrophobic or CHG PICCs, with or without valves, to meet these criteria, prevent thrombotic and infection complications and promote PICC function. The aim of this study is to compare two novel technologies (hydrophobic and CHG PICCs) with standard care (conventional polyurethane PICCs), to identify clinically effective and cost-effective methods to reduce the incidence of PICC failure, due to thrombotic and infectious complications.</p>

                <title>Recruitment, randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding</title>
                <p>Hospital-based research nurses (ReNs) are screening patients, gaining informed consent from patients/parents, randomising, educating clinical staff, patients and families, monitoring protocol compliance and collecting weekly data on patients ‘on trial’ plus final outcome data for completed patients. Patients are randomised via a central web-based service (Griffith University) immediately prior to each PICC insertion to ensure allocation concealment until study entry. Randomisation is at in a 1:1:1 ratio between groups, with randomly varied block sizes (up to 20) and stratification by: (1) hospital and (2) hypercoagulable state (adults: high risk of thrombosis as per Michigan Risk Score<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>; paediatrics: previous thrombosis or active cancer).</p>
                <p>PICC inserters have been provided training by the product manufacturers regarding the insertion of intervention PICCs, with additional resources available to support practice. The inserters are provided with the randomised PICC in prepacks, immediately prior to insertion, to ensure study fidelity. It is not possible to blind clinical staff, since they must insert, access and monitor PICCs, and they are visibly different. However, the outcome of PICC failure is objective, easily assessed and routinely assigned by clinical staff who are not investigators. Infectious disease physicians and radiologists are masked when determining infection and thrombosis outcomes, standardised definitions are used for these outcomes and the biostatistician will be masked to allocation when provided the dataset.</p>

                <p>Other than PICC type, all other PICC insertion, care and management have been standardised in accordance with Queensland Health clinical practice guidelines (at all study sites).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This includes skin preparation with 2% CHG in 70% alcohol prior to insertion, sterile insertion, ultrasound guidance for insertion, securement with sutureless securement devices and polyurethane dressings and removal as soon as clinically appropriate. Maintenance and removal will be by usual hospital staff, with existing guidelines in place. As a pragmatic trial, variations in such care are being noted but not considered as protocol violations. A protocol violation is the insertion of a non-randomised PICC.</p>

                <title>Microbiological substudy</title>
                <p>To determine the effect of (1) hydrophobic and (2) CHG PICCs on bacterial colonisation, PICC-associated infection and CHG resistance, compared with (3) conventional PICCs, catheter tips are being sent for further microbiological analysis in a selection of participants following PICC removal. This includes all PICC tips removed due to suspected infection, plus a control group of PICC tips from participants with no symptoms of infection (matched according to randomisation arm at a ratio of 2:1 cases to controls). All PICC tips are being cultured using the roll-plating method on blood agar, with quantification of cfus, species identification using Vitek-MS (BioMerieux) and susceptibility testing for a standard panel of antibiotics by Vitek 2 automated broth microdilution. In addition, CHG tolerance is being tested by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations against organisms isolated from PICC tips using broth microdilution (with an MIC ≥4 mg/L defining reduced susceptibility to CHG).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Genes known to be associated with CHG tolerance (eg, <italic>qacA/B</italic> and <italic>smr</italic>) are being confirmed by PCR. In patients with suspected CASBI and the same species grown in PICC tip cultures, organisms isolated from both blood and tip cultures are having DNA extracted and whole genome sequencing performed on the Illumina MiniSeq platform. Raw reads are being trimmed, checked for quality metrics, assembled and analysed using a custom pipeline to confirm species identification, define in silico multilocus sequence type and detect the presence of any antibiotic resistance genes. Other genes known to be associated with CHG tolerance and biofilm formation are being sought by BLAST against the assembled genomes. To confirm whether PICC tip and blood culture isolates are clonal, core genome differences between blood and PICC tip isolates are being determined by comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms.</p>

                <p>A subgroup of participants (n=120) are having blood collected on PICC insertion and, if possible, at the time of removal to assess haematological, coagulation profile and platelet activation. Blood samples are being collected via the PICC (from discard and whole blood aspirate) by ReN in sodium citrate and EDTA vacutainers (platelet/full blood count), and the samples will be analysed for full blood examination (including white blood cell differentiation), clotting times (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time), platelet activation studies (flow cytometry) and D-dimer. These analyses will link the theoretical proposed mechanism of action to the clinically reported outcomes, strengthening study outcomes.

Primary analyses will compare between-group device failure rates using Cox proportional hazards regression, with treatment group included as the main effect. Effect estimates will be presented for hydrophobic PICCs versus conventional polyurethane PICCs and for CHG-impregnated PICCs versus conventional polyurethane PICCS as HRs with corresponding 95% CIs. Time-to-event data will be displayed graphically using Kaplan-Meier curves, and the differences between each of the hydrophobic and CHG PICC treatment groups and the conventional polyurethane PICC group will be compared using the log-rank test. The cause of any missing data will be assessed, and sensitivity analyses to investigate the potential impact of missingness will be undertaken using multiple imputation techniques if appropriate. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations (ie, insertion of an unallocated PICC). P values ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant, except for the primary outcome (≤0.031), which has been chosen due to the two intervention arms being tested against a single control and to account for the two interim analyses of each intervention arm against control.</p>

                <title>Estimating cost parameters</title>
                <p>We hypothesise significantly reduced costs over control from a direct hospital perspective for the episode of care (2020 standardised $). We will quantify additional costs, cost offsets and net monetary benefit, considering PICC failure, reinsertions and treatment costs of complications per group. A microcosting or bottom-up approach will be used with detailed resource use for PICC insertion/removal recorded for 75 procedures selected at random (25/group). Staff wage costs for application, troubleshooting, replacement, consultation and equipment used will be recorded. Regression analysis of the total cost per patient as the dependent variable will be conducted using a generalised linear model with trial group allocation (either intervention or usual care) as the predictive variable and controlling possible confounders. A gamma family, log-link model has been assumed given the typically skewed nature of health cost data but will be further tested for appropriate model specification. To explore potential differences in health-related quality of life and patient experience, participants are being asked to complete both the EuroQol Five Dimension (EQ-5-D) multiattribute utility instrument at insertion and removal (including EQ-5D-Youth for 8–17 year-olds)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> and the Australian Hospital Patient Experience Question Set, developed by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> at removal.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>PICCs are a common medical device and an important component of modern healthcare, but the current failure rate of up to 30% is unacceptable and leads patients to experience multiple adverse events. As demonstrated in other vascular access types, innovations in PICC materials and design are an opportunity to reduce this preventable harm to patients and improve efficiencies in healthcare. These technologies are novel and potentially life-saving; however, this independent, sufficiently powered RCT is necessary to ascertain efficacy. Adoption of new technologies without evidence, including economic, may increase expenditure without increased value or cause unintended adverse events.</p>
