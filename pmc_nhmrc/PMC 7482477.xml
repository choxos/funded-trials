                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Peanut allergy is the the most common cause of life-threatening food-induced anaphylaxis. There is currently no effective long-term treatment. There is a pressing need for definitive treatments that improve the quality of life and prevent fatalities. Allergen oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a promising approach, which is effective at inducing desensitisation; however, OIT has a limited ability to induce sustained unresponsiveness (SU). We have previously shown that a novel treatment comprising a combination of the probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> CGMCC 1.3724 with peanut OIT (Probiotic Peanut Oral ImmunoTherapy (PPOIT)) is highly effective at inducing SU, with benefit persisting to 4 years after treatment cessation in the majority of initial treatment responders. Here we describe the protocol for a Phase IIb multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial (PPOIT-003) with dual primary objectives to evaluate the effectiveness of PPOIT at inducing SU (assessed at 8 weeks after treatment cessation) compared with placebo treatment and peanut OIT alone, in children with peanut allergy.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>200 children 1 to 10 years of age with current peanut allergy confirmed by failed double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) at study screening will be recruited from three tertiary paediatric hospitals in Australia. There are three intervention arms—PPOIT, peanut OIT alone or placebo. Interventions are administered once daily for 18 months. The dual primary outcomes are: (1) the proportion of children who attain 8-week SU in the PPOIT group versus placebo group and (2) the proportion of children who attain 8-week SU in the PPOIT group versus OIT group.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>The prevalence of food allergy in the paediatric population has risen exponentially in recent decades. Now affecting 8%<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> of children and 10% of infants,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> food allergy is a significant public health problem in Western countries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Peanut allergy affects 2% of children and is usually lifelong.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> Moreover, peanut is one of the the most common causes of anaphylaxis<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and death<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> from food allergy.</p>
                <p>There is currently no effective long-term treatment to modify the natural history of food allergy. Management involves avoidance of the food concerned, provision of an epinephrine autoinjector in some cases, and early recognition of allergic symptoms and initiation of appropriate emergency treatment. Accidental ingestion is common, causing frequent and sometimes severe reactions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Unpredictability of symptoms from unintentional ingestion cause significant psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life for patients and their families.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The ultimate goal is to develop immunomodulatory strategies that target the underlying immune dysregulation of allergic disease to induce a tolerant state, allowing allergic individuals to safely ingest foods on a lasting basis.</p>
                <p>Although the precise mechanisms are incompletely understood, in broad terms, the development and maintenance of oral tolerance appears to be an active and antigen-specific immune response that depends on both: (a) exposure to allergen which induces an allergen-specific immune response and (b) initial allergen presentation in an ambient immunological milieu which optimally favours regulatory immune responses. It is therefore logical to consider both elements in therapeutic and preventive strategies. This is the basis of our treatment approach which comprises administration of both allergen (peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT)) and an adjunctive immune response modifier (IRM), as discussed further below. So far, most immunotherapy studies have focussed on food allergen delivery alone, without associated IRM.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref>
</p>
                <p>Tolerance can be defined as the permanent state of immune unresponsiveness to food antigens that does not require any continuing food exposure.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Since assessing for permanent ‘tolerance’ is difficult within the time frame of clinical trials,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the ability to induce ‘sustained unresponsiveness (SU)’ is used as a surrogate measure of more prolonged protection in food immunotherapy studies. SU is defined as the ability to tolerate a food after a period of avoidance of at least weeks or months and is considered to reflect redirection of the underlying allergic response towards tolerance. SU is optimally measured by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), with a cumulative dose of peanut protein equivalent to the amount required for diagnosis or exclusion of peanut allergy in the clinical setting, performed at least several weeks after the cessation of treatment.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Another outcome that can be achieved with food immunotherapy is desensitisation, defined as a transient increase in reaction threshold that is only maintained with continuing and regular allergen exposure. Desensitisation reflects downregulation of effector cell/mast cell activation without redirection of the underlying allergic response.</p>
                <p>OIT has garnered intense interest as a potential food allergy treatment. OIT has been shown to consistently induce desensitisation in a high proportion of participants; however, effectiveness of OIT to induce SU appears to be modest.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 20</xref> Few studies have examined for SU following peanut OIT. The first uncontrolled open-label study of peanut OIT (maintenance dose 125 mg peanut protein for 22 months) reported SU in 13% (3/23) of treated children.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A second uncontrolled study (4 g peanut protein for 5 years) reported SU in 31% (12/39) of OIT-treated patients by intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) (or 50% (12/24) by per protocol analysis).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> As there was no control group in either of these studies, it is difficult to ascertain the benefit from OIT over and above natural resolution which can occur in ~20% of children within 5 years.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 22</xref> A third open-label controlled study of peanut OIT (4 g peanut protein for 2 years) in 43 patients 5 to 45 years of age reported SU in 30.4% (7/23) of the OIT group compared with 0% (0/20) of control patients.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The only double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of peanut OIT<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> that evaluated SU as an outcome randomised 120 peanut allergic patients (aged 7 to 55 years) to receive: (1) peanut OIT (maintenance 4 g) for 104 weeks followed by peanut discontinuation (peanut-0, n=60), (2) peanut OIT (maintenance 4 g) for 104 weeks followed by 300 mg peanut daily (peanut-300, n=35) or (3) oat flour for 104 weeks followed by peanut avoidance (placebo group, n=25). All participants were followed for 3 years (156 weeks). DBPCFC was performed at week 104, 117, 130, 143 and 156. The rate of SU (defined as those passing both the week 104 and 117 challenges) in the peanut-0 group was 35% (21/60), compared with 4% in the placebo group.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These studies show that while OIT can induce SU in some patients, effectiveness appears to be limited.</p>
                <p>Patients with ‘desensitisation’ (without evidence of SU) remain at risk of allergic reactions to allergen, including to previously tolerated doses, despite continuing with regular allergen exposure. Studies indicate that children who have been desensitised following OIT experience allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine treatment, more frequently than if they had continued with traditional food avoidance management strategies.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–28</xref> This highlights the importance of identifying an effective immunomodulatory therapy that can induce SU or tolerance, which are expected to provide greater benefit and safety to individuals with food allergy than is achieved by desensitisation.</p>
                <p>We postulated that IRM may enhance the ability of allergen OIT in inducing SU and tolerance. IRM are a class of tolerogenic compounds, typically of microbial origin, which modulate immune responses by acting on antigen-presenting cells through pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors. One well-characterised IRM is the probiotic bacteria <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG, with demonstrated immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo that can support acquisition of oral tolerance, including induction of T regulatory and Th1 cytokine responses.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29–32</xref> Furthermore, oral co-administration of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rhamnosus</italic> GG with antigen has been shown to enhance antigen-specific IgA responses, which are also known to promote oral tolerance.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref>
</p>
                <p>In a landmark forerunner study to the current trial, we reported the first randomised controlled trial (RCT)<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> evaluating a combination of probiotic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rhamnosus</italic> CGMCC 1.3724 (which is genetically indistinguishable from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rhamnosus</italic> GG) together with probiotic and peanut OIT (Probiotic Peanut Oral ImmunoTherapy (PPOIT)).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Sixty-two children with peanut allergy were randomised to receive either PPOIT or placebo for 18 months. The probiotic <italic>L</italic>. <italic>rhamnosus</italic> CGMCC 1.3724 was administered as a fixed daily dose (2×10<sup>10</sup> cfu), while the peanut OIT was a daily dose of peanut protein starting at low doses and increasing to a maintenance dose of 2 g peanut protein. SU was assessed by DBPCFC performed 4 (±2) weeks after cessation of treatment. Eighty-two per cent of PPOIT-treated participants achieved SU to peanut compared with only 3.6% of placebo-treated children. PPOIT treatment was also associated with reduced peanut SPT and specific IgE (sIgE), and increased peanut specific IgG4 (sIgG4), suggesting modulation of the underlying allergic response to peanut. Furthermore, the clinical benefit of PPOIT was shown to be long-lasting, with 70% of PPOIT-treated children who achieved SU at the end of treatment still having challenge-confirmed SU at 4 years after end of treatment (assessed by DBPCFC performed following 8 weeks of peanut elimination).<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> For logistic reasons, this preliminary study did not compare PPOIT with OIT alone. Having demonstrated that PPOIT is highly effective at inducing long-lasting SU in children with peanut allergy, it is now imperative to examine whether the combined PPOIT treatment is more effective than peanut OIT at inducing SU, and hence to determine if the probiotic IRM does indeed offer added benefit over and above peanut OIT alone. It is also necessary to confirm the previous findings in a larger multicentre randomised trial.</p>
                <p>This paper reports the research protocol for a Phase IIb multicentre, double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial evaluating the efficacy of PPOIT at inducing SU compared with both placebo and peanut OIT alone.</p>

                  <p>Participants who are identified as potentially being suitable to participate in the study and their parents will be sent an Information Statement and Consent Form as approved by the RCH and local site Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) and Research Governance Office.</p>
                  <p>Prior to full study enrolment and gathering any further study-specific personal information or performing any study-specific procedures (eg, screening DBPCFC), a signed consent form will be obtained from the parent(s) or guardian of the participant. Randomisation and enrolment will take place up to 1 week prior to the Rush Induction visit (initiation of study treatment). The Rush Induction visit may be delayed up to 3 months after screening visit.</p>

                  <title>Randomisation and concealment mechanism</title>
                  <p>Participants will be enrolled and randomised up to 1 week prior to Rush Induction, and within 3 months of their screening appointment. Randomisation will be to PPOIT, OIT or placebo groups, with an allocation ratio of 2:2:1. Randomisation will be stratified by study site (RCH, PCH and WCH), by age (1 to 5 years; 6 to 10 years) and by peanut SPT weal size (≤10 mm; &gt;10 mm). Stratification by age and SPT weal size is necessary for data analysis because younger age and smaller SPT size are associated with a greater likelihood of natural resolution. Each study site will have their own randomisation list stratified by age and peanut SPT weal size. Randomisation will be in randomly permuted blocks of variable length. An independent statistician in the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit (CEBU) at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) will provide the randomisation schedules to hospital pharmacies at each site.</p>
                  <p>Participant eligibility will be established prior to enrolment and randomisation. A unique participant screening number will be allocated to each consenting participant prior to proceeding with study screening. Participants who are confirmed as eligible for the study after the screening visit (including having failed the screening DBPCFC) will have an appointment made for Rush Induction and study personnel will notify the pharmacist that the participant is eligible for enrolment and randomisation.</p>
                  <p>Participants will be enrolled into the trial in strict sequence as their eligibility for enrolment is determined. Randomisation and enrolment will only be performed up to 1 week prior to Rush Induction—a small number of participants who are eligible for the study at study screening may decide not to proceed with the study between the challenge and the Rush Induction day.</p>
                  <p>The pharmacist will assign the next available unique randomisation number for the participant’s appropriate stratum using the randomisation list and notify the trial personnel of that number. This randomisation number will be recorded on the participant’s CRF (case report form). The pharmacist will prepare the participant’s allocated study treatment and label the treatment with the participant’s randomisation number. Participants, outcome assessors, other research staff, treating clinicians, investigators and statistical analyst will be blinded to treatment allocation.</p>

Participants will be able to record any concern or adverse event in the diary for review at each study visit. Causality will be assessed by study doctors, using the following categories: unrelated, unlikely to be related, possibly related and probably related. The severity of an adverse event will be assessed and categorised according to whether the event is an allergic reaction or a non-allergic reaction. If the adverse event is an allergic reaction, the severity of the event will be categorised based on criteria adapted from the NIAID Consortium for Food Allergy Research-specific grading system for allergic reactions. For all other adverse events (ie, events which are not allergic reactions), the severity of the event will be classified according to the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines.</p>

                  <title>Sample size and power calculation</title>
                  <p>The study sample size will be 200 participants, randomly allocated in a 2:2:1 ratio to PPOIT (n=80), OIT (n=80) and placebo (n=40). Since the study aims to assess two primary treatment comparisons, a hierarchical ‘fixed-sequence’ testing strategy will be used to maintain a global type I error of 5% for the study.</p>
                  <p>For the first treatment comparison, PPOIT versus placebo, we conservatively estimate a proportion of 60% of participants will achieve SU with PPOIT based on the results of our previous RCT;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and the natural rate of resolution of peanut allergy is conservatively assumed to be equal to or below 15%.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Applying a 2:1 ratio for randomisation to PPOIT and placebo arms, sample sizes of n=70 and n=35 will provide &gt;99% power with two-tailed 0.05 significance level for the Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test to detect the difference between 60% SU in the PPOIT group and 15% in the placebo group.</p>
                  <p>For the second treatment comparison, PPOIT versus OIT, a pilot study of peanut OIT reported SU in 30% of participants.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A sample size of n=70 in PPOIT and n=70 in OIT groups will provide 85% power with two-tailed 0.05 significance level to detect the difference between 60% SU in the PPOIT group and 35% in the OIT group.</p>
                  <p>Allowing for a 12.5% loss to follow-up, we will recruit 200 children, resulting in approximately 80 children in each of the PPOIT and OIT groups, and 40 in the placebo group. In our completed RCT, loss to follow-up was 10%.</p>

                  <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                  <p>Data handling, verification and analysis will be performed by an independent clinical research organisation, Datapharm Australia, in collaboration with the CEBU at MCRI. Statistical analysis will follow standard methods for randomised trials and the primary analysis will be by ITT.</p>
                  <p>All available data from all participants who received any investigational product will be included in the analysis of the safety data.</p>
                  <p>All demographic and baseline continuous outcomes will be presented as mean and standard deviation (or medians and IQRs for skewed data), while categorical outcomes will be presented as absolute and relative frequencies in the three groups.</p>
                  <p>Unless specified otherwise, statistical tests will be conducted at the 5% significance level (alpha) and all CIs will be reported as 95%.</p>
                  <p>The primary analysis will be conducted when all participants have either completed the T2 visit or terminated the study prior to their T2 DBPCFC. At the completion of the last T2 visit, database lock and statistical analyses on the primary and secondary outcomes to the T2 time point will be conducted by an independent unblinded statistician (Datapharm Australia). Participants and study staff will remain blinded to treatment allocation and will continue onto the Monitoring (non-treatment) phase. When all participants have either completed the T3 visit or terminated the study prior to T3, the final database lock will occur and statistical analyses on the secondary outcomes to T3 time point and exploratory outcomes will be performed.</p>
                  <sec id="s3-13-2-1">
                    <title>Primary outcomes</title>
                    <p>The primary endpoint is whether a participant has SU (passed T1 and T2 challenges). Results will be summarised as the number and proportion of participants with SU in the three treatment groups. Comparison between PPOIT with placebo as well as between PPOIT with OIT will be presented as risk differences and relative risks, accompanied by their 95% CI, with the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups tested using Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> statistic. Moreover, logistic regression analysis with adjustment for the stratification variables (centre, age category and SPT weal size category) used in the randomisation, will be conducted and ORs with respective CIs reported.</p>

                    <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                    <p>Group comparisons (PPOIT versus placebo; PPOIT versus OIT; and OIT versus placebo) regarding dichotomous outcomes will be presented as risk differences and relative risks, accompanied by their 95% CI, as well as using OR estimates with 95% CIs, obtained from a logistic regression analysis with adjustment for the stratification variables used in the randomisation.</p>
                    <p>If normally distributed, continuous outcomes will be compared using differences between mean values, estimated from linear regression models. In particular, peanut SPT weal size, sIgE and sIgG4 levels will be reported as mean and SD by treatment group, and presented at the end of treatment (T1), at T2 and at the end of study (T3). The difference in mean between groups and the corresponding 95% CIs (PPOIT versus placebo; PPOIT versus OIT; and OIT versus placebo) will be obtained by using an unadjusted and adjusted (by stratification variables used in the randomisation) linear regression and the hypothesis of no difference between the groups tested with a t-test. Analogously, quality of life continuous outcome measures will be summarised by treatment group at the end of treatment (T1) and the end of study (T3) and presented as a difference in means between groups and the corresponding 95% CI (PPOIT versus placebo and PPOIT versus OIT), obtained by using unadjusted and adjusted linear regression. If continuous outcomes do not follow normal distributions, they will be summarised as median and IQR in the three groups, and comparison between groups will be performed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test. The cumulative tolerated dose at the T1, which is inherently non-normally distributed, will be will be presented as medians and IQR by treatment groups and compared between treatment groups in pairwise fashion using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
                    <p>A per-protocol analysis will also be performed whereby participants will be excluded if they completed less than 68 weeks of study treatment, or are recorded to have intake of probiotic supplements or products containing the probiotic <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG on 30 or more days of the active treatment period, or are recorded to have intake of peanut on 30 or more days of the active treatment period or do not have the primary outcome data available or treatment compliance is not between 80% and 120% for both the buildup and maintenance phases of the study.</p>
                    <p>Safety tables will present the frequency and percentage of participants with an adverse event and the number of events, by relationship to study drug (unrelated, unlikely to be related, possibly related and probably related), by severity, by study phase and according to whether the event is an allergic reaction or a non-allergic reaction. Similar separate summaries of serious adverse events (SAEs) will also be provided.</p>
                    <p>Full details of the primary and secondary statistical analyses will be specified in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be finalised before study database lock. The SAP will detail covariates to be considered in the primary analysis model as well as subgroup and sensitivity analyses to be performed. The SAP will also outline the imputation strategy to handle missing data.</p>
