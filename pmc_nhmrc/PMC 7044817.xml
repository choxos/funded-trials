                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Depression is a common and debilitating condition. In Australia, general practitioners (GPs) are the key providers of depression care. However, available evidence suggests that case finding for depression in primary care is poor. This study will examine whether a systematic approach to screening for depression and assessing patient preferences for depression care improves depression outcomes among primary care patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A cluster randomised controlled design will be used with general practice clinics randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=12) or usual care group (n=12). Patients who are aged 18 and older, presenting for general practice care, will be eligible to participate. Eighty-three participants will be recruited at each clinic. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline survey administered on a touch screen computer at their GP clinic, and then a follow-up survey at 3, 6 and 12 months. Those attending usual care practices will receive standard care. GPs at intervention practices will complete an online Clinical e-Audit, and will be provided with provider and patient-directed resources for depression care. Patients recruited at intervention practices who score 10 or above on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 will have feedback regarding their depression screening results and preferences for care provided to their GP. The primary analysis will compare the number of cases of depression between the intervention and control groups.</p>

                  <p>The study has been approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee, and registered with Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of Wollongong, Monash University and University of New South Wales. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications and conference presentations.</p>

              <p>Depression affects 350 million people worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It can have a profound impact on quality of life and is associated with unemployment and economic disadvantage.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Depression and anxiety are the second highest causes of disease burden in Australia, with mental disorders costing over $6.38 billion annually in direct and indirect costs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In 2015–2016, depression was the fourth most common problem managed by general practitioners (GPs), accounting for 4.2 in every 100 encounters<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and depression accounts for 12% of primary care initiated referrals to allied health providers.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
              <p>Available evidence suggests one barrier to improving depression outcomes is poor case finding in the primary care setting. Mitchell’s meta-analysis of 41 studies indicated that there was agreement between GPs’ unassisted diagnoses of depression among primary care patients and diagnoses from structured interviews in only 47% of cases.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Our study, conducted with 51 GPs and over 1500 primary care patients, also demonstrated that GP unassisted diagnosis was highly specific (87%), but poor in terms of sensitivity (51%) compared with a standardised instrument, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Several reviews have addressed the question of whether providing GPs with feedback about patients’ scores on a standardised assessment of depression is effective in improving outcomes in the primary care setting.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> The most recent systematic review identified just five studies relevant to the general adult primary care population.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Of the five trials, three reported no intervention effect.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> Notably, the two studies which reported a positive impact also included additional staff support to assist with managing depression. In the first study, 47% of those newly identified with depression achieved remission in the intervention group, compared with 28% in the usual care group at 12 months.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In the second, 58% of people newly and previously identified as cases achieved remission in the intervention group, compared with 49% in the usual care group at 12 months.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite the relative simplicity and potential benefits of providing feedback to GPs on patients’ depression scores, there is a lack of methodologically adequate research to inform practice. Studies are characterised by a lack of power and high attrition.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Four out of five studies in O’Connor’s review<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> were conducted in the USA, and no Australian trials have been conducted. Therefore, the applicability of available evidence to the Australian context is unknown.</p>
              <p>Primary care patients who receive treatment that matches their preference recover more quickly<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and are less likely to drop out of treatment<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> than those who perceive a mismatch between their preferred and received treatment. Therefore, information about patients’ perceived needs and preferences for treatment are likely to be an important adjunct to information on severity of depressive symptoms. This study will examine the effectiveness of an intervention providing GPs with feedback about their patients’ depressive symptoms, preferences and perceived need for help.</p>

                <p>A two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial with general practices as the unit of allocation (please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Consenting practices will be randomly allocated to either: (1) usual care or (2) intervention. Patient outcomes will be collected at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of likely ‘cases’ of depression at a 12-month follow-up, as measured by the PHQ-9. Cost-effectiveness and delivery of depression care will be assessed using data that reflects the resources used to deliver the intervention, including implementation costs and health service utilisation, specifically the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). Utilisation data will be obtained for the 12 months preceding patient recruitment and 12 months postrecruitment for consenting participants. Results will be reported in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials recommendations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

A number of quality assurance processes will be used to endure data entry is accurate. First, programming of SAS will restrict the number of valid entries for a given question, thus alerting to a potential error if data outside these values is entered. A random sample of 20% will be double entered. Finally, data cleaning will take place to identify anomalies in the data that may require cross-checking with original surveys. Survey data from baseline and each follow-up will be linked for each participant. These data will be linked to data obtained from the Department of Human Services on the use of MBS services and medications obtained via the PBS.</p>

                    <p>For the primary outcome, a PHQ-9 score of less than 10 at 12 months, we will test for group differences using a generalised linear mixed effects regression model, with a log link and a binomial distribution. The dichotomous outcome at each follow-up (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months) is the dependent variable. The model will include fixed effect for baseline history of depression, treatment group (intervention vs usual care), time, and treatment*time interaction, and a random intercept for each practice (assumed to be normally distributed) to account for the hierarchical structure in the data of patients nested within practices. Treatment group comparisons at postbaseline each visit will be estimated by differences in LS means from the treatment*visit interaction and will be presented as risk ratios with accompanying p values and 95% CIs, with the primary comparison being that at 12 months. We will investigate various variance–covariance structures for the within-subject repeated measures (such as autoregressive, unstructured and compound symmetric) and choose the model with the best fit according to the smallest Akaike information criteria. As a sensitivity analysis, we will perform analyses under a variety of plausible assumptions regarding the missing data mechanism to investigate the impact of departures from the missing data assumptions.</p>

                    <p>A sample of 720 patients per treatment arm (~60 per practice) at 12 months follow-up will give the study 80% power to detect a 10% decrease in the proportion of patients who score more than 10 on the PHQ-9 in the experimental group compared with usual care at a significance level of 5%. This calculation assumes, based on data from our prior study, an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.04, and 20% of the patients in the usual care group will have PHQ-9 scores of more than 10. Allowing for 10% attrition at each follow-up, we will need to recruit 2000 eligible consenting patients (~83 per practice). Prior trials of depression screening interventions among general adult populations in primary care have demonstrated differences between study arms in depression outcomes of between 10% and 20%,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> therefore, an effect size of 10% was considered feasible for this study. The study outcome, a score of 10 or more on the PHQ-9, was selected because this threshold has been shown to identify clinically significant depressive symptoms with a high degree of accuracy.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Therefore, a reduction of the proportion of people experiencing clinically relevant symptoms of depression of 10% may be considered clinically important, not only for the individuals affected but also on a population level.</p>

                <p>The economic study will be based on a cost-effectiveness analysis using within-trial outcomes and will be undertaken from a healthcare provider perspective. The study will capture the costs and consequences from the intervention and compare them to usual care. Costs will be estimated based on the additional resources required for intervention delivery, as well as net costs associated with healthcare utilisation. Unit cost data for all resources associated with an intervention will be collated based on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee manual of resource items<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and the Medicare Schedule, measured in real prices for the selected reference year. The measure of effect will be QALYs. QALYs will be calculated from SF-6D, a multiattribute utility instrument that can be derived from the responses to the SF-12. The costs and health outcomes will be used to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, reflecting the additional cost per QALY gained. Cost-effectiveness and acceptability will be assessed against commonly accepted willingness to pay estimates per QALY. The economic results will be considered in the context of decision-making criteria: strength of evidence; capacity of the intervention to reduce inequity; acceptability to stakeholders; feasibility and sustainability. The analysis will conform to National Health and Medical Research Council protocols for economic evaluations.</p>

Patients have not been directly involved in the design of the study. Patients will be asked to participate in the study via the procedures outlined previously. On consenting the study, participants will be asked if they would like to receive a summary of the study findings at the completion of the study. Objective data obtained through Medicare will allow us to quantify differences in healthcare contacts attributable to the intervention, thus providing an indication of participant burden. GPs will be asked to self-report their views about the impact of the intervention on practice functioning. Processes measures including consent rates, and drop-out rates will be used to monitor acceptability.</p>
