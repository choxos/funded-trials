                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Accessing quality mental health care poses significant challenges for persons affected by adversity, especially in low- and middle-income countries where resources are scarce. To mitigate this, the World Health Organization has developed group problem management plus (gPM+), a low-intensity psychological intervention for adults experiencing psychological distress. gPM+ is a group-based intervention consisting of five-sessions, and can be delivered by non-specialist providers. This paper outlines the study protocol for a trial of gPM+ in Jordan.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will conduct a single-blind, two-arm, randomized controlled trial in a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. We aim to enrol 480 adults into the trial. Participants will be eligible for the trial if they screen positive for levels of psychological distress. Following screening, those eligible will be randomly assigned to receive the gPM+ intervention or enhanced treatment as usual. The primary outcome is reduction in levels of psychological distress at 3-months post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, depression, prodromal psychotic symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief, daily functioning, economic effectiveness, and change in parenting behaviour. Secondary outcomes also include the reduction in psychological distress of the participant’s child.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">Globally, there are currently more than 70 million displaced people, with over 25 million refugees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Refugees are exposed to many distressing and potentially traumatic events, including war, sexual violence, torture, dangers faced while fleeing their homeland, and risks associated with being confined in camps or detention centers. It is not surprising that refugees have been shown to experience elevated rates of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicide risk, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and somatic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The largest population of refugees are Syrians who have fled from the 2011 Syrian civil war. UNHCR projections indicate that 15–20% of Syrians will experience mental health conditions in the aftermath of the adversity they have faced, thus highlighting a need for effective interventions for conflict-affected populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Evidence-based mental health programs have been shown to be efficacious in refugee populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], with meta-analysis indicating they have a moderate effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Despite the potential of these interventions, there are often obstacles to implementation of these programs in countries hosting refugees. These programs have generally not been scaled up in many settings of humanitarian crises, or in those hosting large numbers of refugees, because these interventions: (a) tend to only target a single diagnostic outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], (b) are generally resource intensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and (c) require professionals or extensively trained and supervised lay therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Like most humanitarian settings, countries hosting a vast number of refugees are often not adequately resourced to provide the services necessary to address the mental health needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In response, there has been a move towards ‘task-shifting’ programs that train non-specialists in simple mental health programs to increase the workforce capacity to implement mental health programs in low and middle income countries (LMIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of task-shifting programs indicated they yielded a moderate effect size in reducing psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">In line with its Mental Health Gap Action Programme, the World Health Organization (WHO) utilised a task-shifting approach to inform the development of an intervention that could be delivered in an affordable manner in under-resourced settings by trained lay providers. The transdiagnostic intervention aimed to effectively reduce common mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This program, Problem Management Plus (PM+), comprises five sessions that teach participants strategies in problem-solving, behavioral activation, arousal reduction, and accessing social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This program has been subjected to multiple large-scale randomised controlled trials, and has been shown to be effective when delivered in individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and small-group formats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although PM+ has been shown to be effective across different populations (survivors of civil unrest and gender-based violence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], it has yet to be shown to be effective in alleviating distress in refugees. Accordingly, one goal of the current trial is to assess how efficacious group-based PM+ is in reducing psychological distress in refugees. This study focused on refugees in a camp environment because this setting can involve specific stressors, including detention, lack of employment opportunities, and restriction to one’s social network (including internet access).</p>
              <p id="Par27">A second goal of the study is to index the extent to which PM+ administered to adult refugees may have beneficial effects on their children. Most of the world’s refugees are under 18 years of age, and they are at risk for elevated rates of psychological difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This pattern is also observed in the context of Syrian refugees, of whom more than 50% are youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. One major factor that can impact a refugee child’s mental health is the psychological status of their parents or caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Specifically, psychological difficulties can adversely affect parenting behavior, which can in turn contribute to psychological impairment in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Accordingly, although PM+ is only administered to adult refugees, this study aimed to assess the extent to which PM+ administered to caregivers also improved the mental health of the participants’ child.</p>

We will conduct a two-arm, single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing Group Problem Management Plus (gPM+) to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) in 480 study participants. See Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for an overview of the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a locally adapted version of gPM+ on symptoms of psychological distress in male and female Syrian refugee adults in Jordan. The secondary aims are to assess (1) the extent to which gPM+ improves the mental health of the participants’ child, and (2) to assess the effectiveness of gPM+ on a range of other measures of adult mental health. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and three and 12 month follow-ups. The primary outcome time point is the 3-month assessment.

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p id="Par33">Assessors hired and trained by UNSW/International Medical Corps (IMC) will identify participants through door-to-door screening in the camp. The assessors will be randomly assigned pre-specified areas within the camps villages. At each caravan, assessors will provide a short explanation of the study and purposes of screening, then ask whether there is an adult who would be willing to participate. After consent has been provided, the assessor will record socio-demographic data and ask the participant to complete the WHODAS 2.0, K10, and a brief prolonged grief screener (PG-S). The assessor will additionally screen for imminent risk of suicide and neurological impairment.</p>
                <p id="Par34">All screenings will be conducted face-to-face in the participant’s home unless the assessor deems the location unsuitable due to privacy, in which case they will conduct the screening in pre-determined secure locations. If participants are not selected because they score below the cut-offs for the WHODAS 2.0 or the K10, they will be provided feedback on their test outcomes and reasons why they are not eligible for the study will be explained to them. If participants meet any of the exclusion criteria, assessors will refer cases to their clinical supervisor who will subsequently refer them to specialised services in accordance to interagency standard operating procedures. If participants screen positively and are not excluded due to neurological impairment or suicide ideation, assessors will schedule a follow up appointment to obtain consent to participate in the trail and administer the pre-assessment. Pre-assessment consists of the following instruments: Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], Traumatic Events Checklist (TEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], Post-Migration Living Difficulties (PMLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], Psychological Outcome Profiles (PSYCHLOPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], Access to Health Care Services (AHCS), Client-Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], the Prodromal Questionnaire – Brief (PQ-B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], Prolonged Grief-13 scale (PG-13) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. If the participant’s child provides assent, we will additionally ask them to complete the child-reported version of the Pediatric Symptoms Checklist-35 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">The post-intervention assessment is scheduled 7 weeks after the pre-intervention assessment (i.e., 1 week after the 5th PM+ session), and the follow-up assessment is scheduled at 3 months after the post-intervention assessment (i.e. 20 weeks after inclusion, in line with the timing of the follow-up assessment for the PM+ participants).

                  <title>The group problem management plus (gPM+) programme</title>
                  <p id="Par39">The WHO PM+ programme involves a set of a brief psychological interventions that seek to ameliorate symptoms of common mental health problems (e.g. depression, anxiety). The intervention protocol was written by a consultant at the University of New South Wales, Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par40">The PM+ manual then underwent a comprehensive cultural and contextual adaptation process to ensure it would be appropriate for Syrian refugees, and then further refined to the local sociocultural context of the lives of Syrians residing in Jordan. The manual was translated into Arabic, after which the translation was reviewed in cultural adaptation workshops.</p>
                  <p id="Par41">PM+ integrates problem-solving and behavioural treatment techniques that demonstrate amenability to low-intensity delivery and are evidence-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. gPM+ is delivered over 5 weekly sessions of 120 min duration. Clients are systematically taught four strategies, including stress management, problem management, behavioural activation, and skills to strengthen social support. In the current RCT, the group PM+ format will be tested in anticipated group size of 8–10 participants. Groups are conducted separately for men and women.</p>
                  <p id="Par42">Each session will be conducted by two gPM+ providers; a facilitator and a co-facilitator. The gPM+ providers will be non-specialists, who are recruited by IMC, Jordan. gPM + providers will hold a bachelor degree in a psychology or a field related to health (form 4 level of education or above) and have proficiency in Arabic. In addition, one local supervisor who works within the camp will be employed. The facilitators will receive 8 days of training in the delivery of the group PM+ intervention as well as basic counselling skills and group facilitation skills. Following training, the gPM+ providers will be required to complete two practice cycles, as a lead facilitator and as a co-facilitator, under close supervision.</p>
                  <p id="Par43">Protocol adherence will be ensured by the supervisors and weekly group supervisions of the facilitators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Supervisors will receive weekly supervision and on-the-job training in supervision skills by a PM+ master trainer to ensure treatment adherence and to provide additional supervisory support as needed.</p>
                  <p id="Par44">To evaluate treatment fidelity, 10% of all PM+ sessions will be attended by the supervisor, using a checklist to ensure basic elements of the PM+ intervention have been followed as required. Facilitators will also complete self-evaluation forms and discuss challenges with the supervisor.</p>

It consists of four questions that encompass three domains: problems (2 questions), functioning (1 question) and wellbeing (1 question). Participants are asked to give free text responses to the problem and function domains. Responses are scored on an ordinal six-point scale producing a maximum score of 20 (5 points per question. The PSYCHLOPS version administered at posttreatment and follow-up also includes an overall valuation question (determining self-rated outcome ranging from “much better” to “much worse”). PSYCHLOPS has been validated in primary care populations across several countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par52">Parenting behaviours will be assessed using the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire-42 (APQ-42). The APQ consists of 42 items measuring various disciplinary practices. Five constructs are measured: (1) involvement, (2) supervision and monitoring, (3) positive parenting, (4) consistent discipline, and (5) corporal punishment. Additional items not utilized in the five constructs assess other forms of disciplinary measures. All items are rated on a 5-point scale (1 = never, 5 = always). Construct scores are calculated by summing item scores.</p>

Each symptom is rated on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 5 = <italic>overwhelmingly</italic>). It is the most widely used measure of PGD, represents a unidimensional scale, and has been shown to index grief-related impairment. The PG-13 items converge with ICD-11 criteria for PGD.</p>

All adverse events will be reported by assessors or PM+ facilitators to this committee, who will ensure that appropriate action is taken by referral to local services. Serious adverse events will be entered in the Castor EDC trial monitoring software and reported to the Study Safety Committee and also to the STRENGTHS Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects within 7 days (in case of death or life-threatening situation) or 15 days (all other events). A Data Monitoring Committee is not formed because multiple trials of PM+ indicate that it is a safe program and will not cause harm. Accordingly, there is no likelihood that the trial will need to be halted prior to its completion.</p>
                <p id="Par58">A total number of 480 participants will be included in the trial.

Bryant and an independent statistical consultant will independently have access to the data and conduct analyses after the blind is broken after the 3-month follow-up. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis will be conducted to assess differential change over time in HSCL-25 scores between groups. For each outcome, the effects of time of measurement, group, and the group-by-time interaction will be analyzed. HLM presumes intent-to-treat analyses as HLM allows the number of observations to vary between participants and effectively handles missing data. Time (linear and quadratic), treatment condition, and their interaction will be included in the models. Fixed effects parameters will be tested at 95%CI. The Level 1 model will represent within-patient change over time, and the Level 2 model will predict variation in within-patient change over time and encompass between-patient variables.

              <p id="Par61">In the context of the increasing number of refugees across the world, there is an ongoing need to evaluate scalable programs that can reduce the common mental disorders that are well-documented in refugees. The specific challenges of living in a refugee camp, in addition to the many adversities experienced by those who have fled war and persecution, highlights the need for programs that can assist people to psychologically cope in these settings. In recognition that most countries hosting refugees have limited resources, it is imperative that any psychosocial programs are affordable in the context of countries’ available resources. It is to this end that this project aims to extend current endeavors in task-shifting to evaluate the extent to which PM+ can reduce distress and improve functioning in Syrian refugees in this camp environment. For this reason these results will be published in in international journals, and disseminated in Arabic to local providers in Jordan. Moreover, there is potentially great opportunities to improve parenting behavior and children’s mental health by enhancing the psychological well-being of parents and caregivers.</p>

              <p id="Par62">The project has been approved locally by the institutional review board at the King Hussein Cancer Centre in Amman, Jordan, and the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent entails a two-step procedure: 1) informed consent to conduct the screening and 2) informed consent for taking part in the gPM+ trial. The latter is only required for participants meeting the inclusion criteria following screening. For each step, participating respondents will be asked to complete a written consent form. For participants who are illiterate, witnessed oral consent will be collected, in line with recommendations from the WHO.</p>
