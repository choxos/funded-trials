                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Evaluations of Intimate Partner Abuse training for general practitioners is limited. The Women’s Evaluation of Abuse and Violence Care study trialled in Australia was a primary care intervention that included delivering the Health Relationships training, a program that educates practitioners on how to provide supportive counselling and assistance to women afraid of an intimate partner. We report on effectiveness of the Healthy Relationships training program within a cluster-randomised controlled trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">General practitioners filled out a baseline survey and surveys before and after training, including quantitative and open-text questions on barriers and enablers to supporting victim-survivors. The Physician Readiness to Manage Intimate Partner Violence Survey (PREMIS) tool, a validated measure, was included to assess practitioner knowledge, skills, confidence, and attitudes. General linear model repeated analysis of variance tested the difference between trial groups over time.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Fifty-two general practitioners completed the baseline demographic survey, with 65% (19 intervention, 18 comparison) completing both pre-and-post-training surveys. There were no between-group differences in baseline characteristics. Post-training, the intervention group had significantly higher average scores than the comparison on perceived preparation to address abuse (<italic>p</italic> = .000), perceived knowledge (<italic>p</italic> = .000), actual knowledge (<italic>p</italic> = .03), and greater awareness of practice-related issues (<italic>p</italic> = .000). There were no between-group differences in PREMIS opinion domain scores on workplace issues, self-efficacy and understanding of victims. Post-training, the qualitative data indicated that the intervention practitioners (<italic>n</italic> = 24) reported increased knowledge, awareness, and confidence, while time pressures and lack of referral options impeded addressing abuse.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The Healthy Relationships Training program for general practitioners increased aspects of practitioner knowledge, skills, and confidence. However, more support is needed to change opinions and support victim-survivors sustainably.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par8">Intimate partner abuse (IPA) is a global public health issue that disproportionately affects women and girls, violating their human rights and overall health and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and South African Medical Research Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] define IPA as any behaviour or action perpetrated by a current or former partner that causes physical, psychological/emotional, sexual, or economic harm. The most common form of IPA is within heterosexual relationships, with men using violence against women and their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While gender is a common element of IPA, some groups’ experiences are compounded by various intersecting factors, such as disability, indigeneity, gender identity, immigration status, and poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Victim-survivors of IPA experience poor physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health, increasing their utilisation of healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>IPA and Healthcare</title>
                <p id="Par9">Because IPA is a significant health issue, victim-survivors experience poor health compared to non-affected persons, including physical injuries, chronic pain, mental health problems (post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety) and reproductive health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Healthcare services that provide care to women and their children, particularly primary care services, are ideally positioned to identify and respond to IPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although evidence from high-income countries indicates that women who experience IPA frequently attend primary care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], few are identified by general practitioners (GPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As victim-survivors most often disclose to GPs, it is essential that they are equipped to support and improve outcomes for patients experiencing IPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par10">Healthcare has a crucial role as the first point of contact for many victim-survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and South African Medical Research Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] recommend that health providers routinely assess high-risk groups for IPA, be trained in IPA risk assessment and be able to provide supportive counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A Cochrane systematic review of 19 trials of health practitioner training for IPA, mostly from the USA, found that the strength of evidence was low to very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There was some evidence that training health practitioners to respond to IPA may impact practitioners’ self-reported attitudes, knowledge, and readiness to respond to IPA. However, training interventions may make little to no difference on practitioner’s referral practice and there are uncertain effects on well-being and health outcomes of victim-survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The authors of the review call for further research to assess impacts of IPA training.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>WEAVE intervention</title>
                <p id="Par11">The Women’s Evaluation of Abuse and Violence Care (WEAVE) study was the first in Australia to determine if a multifaceted intervention in primary care could increase the quality of life, mental health and safety behaviours for women experiencing IPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The WEAVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], cluster randomised control trial (RCT), provided a professional intervention (WEAVE Healthy Relationships Training) to GPs in Victoria, Australia, on how to respond to IPA when women experiencing abuse were identified, and to support them with brief counselling sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The study addressed the evidence gap in how to improve outcomes for women experiencing IPA through a structured intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par12">The WEAVE intervention utilised a combination of methods to develop the Healthy Relationships Training and brief counselling sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The counselling sessions were designed based on the Psychosocial Readiness Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], systematic reviews of healthcare-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] of qualitative studies and international consensus IPA primary care guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The Healthy Relationships training developed from this evidence base has laid the foundation for IPA guidelines and training for GPs in Victoria and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], as well as being adapted as part of other Australian IPA primary care interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The overall trial findings reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] showed that the intervention did not change women’s quality of life. Nevertheless, women’s depression symptoms improved and this was mediated by the level of GP inquiry and GP support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the impact of the WEAVE training on GPs’ self-reported IPA knowledge, confidence, attitudes, and skills in identifying and responding to women are yet to be explored. Therefore, this analysis of the Healthy Relationships training program aims to highlight the impact of this program on GP knowledge of IPA and their ability to improve outcomes for women experiencing IPA.</p>

                <p id="Par13">This paper outlines the evaluation of the Healthy Relationships Training program included in the WEAVE project. WEAVE, a cluster RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], recruited Victorian GPs and their female patients (aged 16–50 years) who screened positive for being afraid of their partner or ex-partner. GPs from both urban and rural areas were recruited between January 2008-January 2010 and randomised between September 2008-June 2010. Eligibility included working three or more sessions per week; used electronic records and that 70% or more of their patients spoke English (based on GP’s self-report and medical records). GPs and their patients were randomly allocated to intervention and comparison groups once all baseline data had been collected. The WEAVE intervention method is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but in brief it included researchers inviting and training GPs to participate in the RCT, researchers inviting female patients via mail to complete a brief survey, screening them for a positive result and then notifying GPs when a female patient screened that they were afraid of their partner and then inviting them for brief GP counselling for relationship and emotional health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">The GPs in the intervention group received the Healthy Relationships Training program that aimed to train practitioners to respond to victim-survivors of IPA and deliver a brief counselling intervention, encourage safety planning and referral. The training included four hours of self-directed learning, two hours of teleconferences and two one-hour in-practice sessions delivered by a GP academic facilitator with a simulated patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Post recruitment, the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was completed with the intervention group over six weeks during December 2008-January 2011 and included:</p>

The brief intervention included discussing the option of referral and collaborative patient care with other health and social services.

Results indicate that post-training, the intervention group had higher mean scores on perceived and actual IPA knowledge(see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This means the intervention groups perceived knowledge, what they felt they knew about IPA identification and management and their actual knowledge about IPA identification and management, increased. See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref> for more information on perceived and actual knowledge measures. The repeated measures MANOVA, with time as the within-subjects variable, revealed a significant difference in perceived knowledge between intervention and comparison group (<italic>F</italic>(1,32) = 19.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>partial eta squared</italic> = 0.379).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par59">The WEAVE Healthy Relationship Training program delivered to GPs in Victoria has formed the foundation of IPA education for primary care services over the last decade and more recently has been rolled out nationally in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This analysis has identified that the WEAVE IPA training was successful in increasing the perceived and actual knowledge of GPs in the intervention group and is consistent with other studies on healthcare provider training to address IPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The intervention group’s greater awareness of practice issues in the post-training survey, highlights that GPs changed their actual practice with an increase in appropriate responses to IPA questions. This included: situations in which GPs ask about IPA, actions undertaken when IPA is disclosed/identified, IPA resources in the clinic and knowledge of IPA services in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Increased knowledge and awareness of these practice issues is essential when managing IPA victim-survivors, and can address healthcare providers’ knowledge gaps, attitudes, and negative responses to IPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given that victim-survivors of IPA expect healthcare practitioners to provide non-judgemental care and offer practical support, such as referrals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], increasing GPs perceived and actual knowledge is critical.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Since the WEAVE training was completed, the Victorian State Government and Australian Federal Government actively engaged in rolling out IPA training to GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While there has been an increase in IPA awareness in the health sector, the issues highlighted in the qualitative analysis convey the GP and system level barriers and enablers to providing quality IPA care and support. Barriers to GPs include lack of time and perceived poor remuneration for engaging in IPA prevention and response. This limits GP self-efficacy and remuneration generally remains a controversial topic in current primary care policy. At a system level, a lack of ongoing training and education in identification and management of IPA patients also challenges the sustainability of the current gains in a complex GP clinic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is a serious ongoing systematic issue. Without primary healthcare service reform, including IPA medical education and ongoing IPA professional development requirements, there is unlikely to be significant and sustainable change to GPs’ ability and willingness to identify and manage patients experiencing IPA. Wider systematic changes to the healthcare sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], in particular primary care, are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] to enable health practitioners to strengthen their readiness to address IPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par61">This paper provides analysis of the WEAVE trial’s training data, with the overall evaluation of the WEAVE trial completed in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It provides the context for which most GP IPA training in Australia has been based. The training’s success in increasing perceived, actual knowledge and understanding of practice issues, which includes identifying more IPA patients and asking more frequently when indicators of IPA occur, highlights why this training has continued to be rolled out or adapted in the primary care setting. The research is limited by the available sample size of GPs who completed the pre-and post-surveys. However, the statistical significance of some of the PREMIS quantitative analysis and the supportive qualitative themes strengthen this research. The WEAVE training of GPs has contributed to further studies in which the training content is adapted to be culturally safe and inclusive care for migrant and refugee communities in the light of Australia’s diverse ethnic populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par62">It is essential for the wider healthcare sector and its funders, the Australian State and Federal Governments, to address the individual and systemic barriers impacting GPs ability to address IPA with the community. Without adequate time and perceived appropriate remuneration, and without increased knowledge and ongoing education in IPA identification and response, GPs will continue to struggle to safely and sustainability identify and support victim-survivors of IPA.</p>
