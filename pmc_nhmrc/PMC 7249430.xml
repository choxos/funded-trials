                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Delayed graft function, the requirement for dialysis due to poor kidney function post-transplant, is a frequent complication of deceased donor kidney transplantation and is associated with inferior outcomes and higher costs. Intravenous fluids given during and after transplantation may affect the risk of poor kidney function after transplant. The most commonly used fluid, isotonic sodium chloride (0.9% saline), contains a high chloride concentration, which may be associated with acute kidney injury, and could increase the risk of delayed graft function. Whether using a balanced, low-chloride fluid instead of 0.9% saline is safe and improves kidney function after deceased donor kidney transplantation is unknown.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">BEST-Fluids is an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, registry-based, multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The primary objective is to compare the effect of intravenous Plasma-Lyte 148 (Plasmalyte), a balanced, low-chloride solution, with the effect of 0.9% saline on the incidence of delayed graft function in deceased donor kidney transplant recipients. From January 2018 onwards, 800 participants admitted for deceased donor kidney transplantation will be recruited over 3 years in Australia and New Zealand. Participants are randomized 1:1 to either intravenous Plasmalyte or 0.9% saline peri-operatively and until 48 h post-transplant, or until fluid is no longer required; whichever comes first. Follow up is for 1 year. The primary outcome is the incidence of delayed graft function, defined as dialysis in the first 7 days post-transplant. Secondary outcomes include early kidney transplant function (composite of dialysis duration and rate of improvement in graft function when dialysis is not required), hyperkalemia, mortality, graft survival, graft function, quality of life, healthcare resource use, and cost-effectiveness. Participants are enrolled, randomized, and followed up using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">If using Plasmalyte instead of 0.9% saline is effective at reducing delayed graft function and improves other clinical outcomes in deceased donor kidney transplantation, this simple, inexpensive change to using a balanced low-chloride intravenous fluid at the time of transplantation could be easily implemented in the vast majority of transplant settings worldwide.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par32">End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a significant public health problem worldwide and its treatment imposes a high healthcare burden and cost. Kidney transplantation is considered the best treatment for ESKD, offering improved survival and quality of life at significantly lower cost than dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, there is a shortage of available donor organs, and many kidney transplants fail prematurely due in part to injury sustained around the time of transplantation.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Delayed graft function (DGF), the requirement for dialysis due to poor kidney function in the early post-operative period, is an increasingly frequent complication of deceased donor kidney transplantation, with a current estimated incidence of 30% or greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition to a longer length of hospital stay, higher costs, and an increased risk of acute rejection in the immediate post-transplant period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], DGF is associated with reduced graft function and inferior graft and patient survival in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par34">DGF reflects acute kidney injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury during transplantation, and is driven by donor, recipient, and transplant factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It results from hypoxia and inflammation induced by hypotension, vasospasm, cytokine release and activation of the innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and it can occur prior to and during organ procurement, during storage and transport, and in the recipient following reperfusion of the graft. Interventions that have reduced the incidence of DGF include treatment of the deceased organ donor with hypothermia or dopamine prior to retrieval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and machine perfusion of the donor kidney during transport and storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, logistics and high costs remain significant barriers to the widespread application of these approaches, and there are currently no established interventions in the recipient that can reduce the incidence of DGF.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Intravenous fluid therapy is a critical, albeit inexpensive, aspect of peri-operative care for the transplant recipient that is required to maintain intravascular volume and optimize graft perfusion and function. Isotonic sodium chloride (“normal” or 0.9% saline) is the standard crystalloid solution utilized at most centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, 0.9% saline may be harmful due to its high chloride concentration relative to plasma (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which causes hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. This in turn may lead to acute kidney injury and DGF as a result of renal vasoconstriction and kidney tissue edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, metabolic acidosis frequently leads to hyperkalemia, increasing the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac instability, further exacerbating kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, utilizing a balanced low-chloride crystalloid solution, such as Plasma-Lyte 148 (Plasmalyte) as an alternative to 0.9% saline may result in improved outcomes after kidney transplantation.

                <p id="Par36">Studies in surgical and intensive care patients administered relatively low volumes of fluid have shown modest reductions in measures of acute kidney injury and dialysis, with balanced low-chloride crystalloids compared with 0.9% saline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In kidney transplantation, studies have shown reduced acidosis with low-chloride solutions compared with 0.9% saline, however, they have been insufficiently powered to detect important differences between the groups for DGF and other transplant outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, these results are not necessarily generalizable to the typical deceased donor kidney transplant setting, as two thirds of studies involved recipients of living donor kidneys (at very low risk of DGF), and trial fluids were only given intra-operatively in relatively low volumes. However, in a recent blinded randomized trial conducted in deceased donor kidney transplant recipients who received fluid volumes more typical of clinical practice (median 6–7 L from surgery until post-operative day two), the incidence of hyperkalemia was significantly lower with Plasmalyte compared with 0.9% saline, and a post-hoc analysis showed improvements in several measures of graft function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Definitive trials in high-risk populations, including deceased donor kidney transplant recipients, are therefore still required.</p>
                <p id="Par37">The Better Evidence for Selecting Transplant Fluids (BEST-Fluids) trial is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that intravenous (IV) fluid therapy with a balanced low-chloride crystalloid solution, Plasmalyte, compared with 0.9% saline, will reduce the incidence and severity of acute kidney injury and delayed graft function in deceased donor kidney transplant recipients.</p>

                <p id="Par39">The secondary objectives are to determine whether peri-operative IV therapy using Plasmalyte, compared with 0.9% saline, (1) improves the recovery of graft function in the first week after transplantation; (2) reduces the number of dialysis treatments required and the duration of dialysis dependence after transplantation; (3) reduces the incidence and severity of hyperkalemia; (4) improves graft survival and death-censored graft survival at 12 months; (5) improves graft function up to 12 months post-transplant; (6) improves health-related quality of life; (7) reduces hospital length of stay and health-related costs; and (8) is cost-effective.</p>

Small children, particularly those under 20 kg in weight, are more susceptible to electrolyte imbalances due to the volumes of IV fluid therapy required post-transplantation, and they have been excluded for safety reasons.

                <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                <p id="Par57">There is physiological and clinical evidence to support the hypothesis that using a balanced low-chloride solution, such as Plasmalyte, as IV therapy in deceased donor kidney transplantation may reduce the potential for adverse effects, including acute kidney injury and DGF, which could occur due to the high-chloride content of 0.9% saline. Available low-chloride solutions that could be utilized as IV crystalloid therapy in transplantation include Plasmalyte, Hartmanns or Ringers Lactate, and Elomel Isoton (Fresenius Kabi). Hartmanns/Ringers Lactate has been used intra-operatively in trials involving transplant recipients, but has the disadvantage of being a hypotonic solution (osmolality 254 mOsm/kg), increasing the risk of post-operative hyponatremia, especially when used in significant volumes as occurs in transplantation. Elomel Isoton, which has been used in a trial of deceased donor transplant recipients, is similar to Plasmalyte, except that acetate is the sole buffer (Plasmalyte contains both acetate and gluconate buffers); however, it is not currently licensed in Australia and New Zealand. Plasmalyte is licensed in Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries, is readily available and already in use at many centers, and was recently evaluated for safety and potential efficacy in a small trial involving deceased donor kidney transplant recipients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus, Plasmalyte was selected as the experimental low-chloride crystalloid fluid therapy for this trial.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Numerous observational studies in the surgical setting have associated the use of 0.9% saline with an increased risk of acute kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, as with all observational studies, these findings may be affected by selection bias and residual confounding, making causal inferences problematic. Two prospective pilot studies (the SPLIT-ICU and SALT trials) in the intensive care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] evaluating the effects of buffered crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline reported no differences between patient groups in the rate of major adverse kidney events. More recently, in two large multiple crossover cluster trials involving &gt; 20,000 non-critically ill and critically ill adult patients, the use of Hartmann’s solution or Plasmalyte resulted in a lower rate of major adverse kidney events when compared to 0.9% saline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Importantly, these studies did not discriminate between patients undergoing kidney transplant and other patients and did not involve individual blinding of the treatment assignments.</p>
                <p id="Par59">In the context of major surgery, the effects of restricting peri-operative use of IV chloride on kidney injury were examined in the LICRA and SOLAR trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In both studies, there was no clinically meaningful difference in the risk of a composite of in-hospital mortality and major post-operative complications, including acute kidney injury. Patients undergoing kidney transplantation were excluded. Accordingly, there are no current guidelines on which crystalloid solution should be used in deceased donor kidney transplantation.</p>
                <p id="Par60">Currently, IV therapy with 0.9% saline is the standard of care at the majority of transplant centers in Australia and New Zealand. In a 2016 survey of 22 renal transplant centers conducted by several of the authors (MC, MF, DR, CH, and SC), 64% reported using 0.9% saline intra-operatively and 87% reported using it post-operatively (unpublished observations), which is similar to published studies from other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Hence, 0.9% saline was chosen as the standard of care to use as the control therapy in this trial.</p>

                <p id="Par64">The allocated trial fluid is administered blinded as the routine IV fluid therapy for all maintenance, replacement, and resuscitation purposes. The fluid is administered from randomization onwards pre-operatively, intra-operatively, and post-operatively, until either IV fluid therapy is no longer required or until 48 h post-transplant, whichever is earliest. The rate and volume of fluid administration are not mandated by the study protocol and are prescribed by treating physicians according to usual center practice.</p>
                <p id="Par65">Participants are each allocated an individual box containing 12 × 1000 mL bags of blinded trial fluid labelled with a unique 4-digit study code (treatment pack number). The treatment pack number is provided by the randomization system (accessed via ANZDATA), corresponding with an available box at the study site. The box of allocated fluids remains physically with the participant during their hospital stay, and is transported with them to the operating theatre and other hospital locations as required. A further two boxes of 12 × 1000 mL fluid bags can be allocated by the randomization system prior to 48 h post-transplant, allowing up to 36 L of trial fluid to be used per participant if required. Each uniquely labelled box can be allocated to one participant only.</p>

                <p id="Par67">Once the 48-h post-transplant timepoint is reached, participants who continue to require IV fluids may be continued on trial fluids beyond 48 h, until the stock of fluid bags within a previously allocated box is exhausted. Alternatively, participants may be converted to open-label fluids prescribed by the treating physician at their discretion.</p>

Presentations on the trial were typically given by site investigators at meetings of clinicians involved in transplant peri-operative care, including transplant and anesthesia departments, to maximize awareness and engagement. Monitoring visits by the staff from the trial coordinating center are conducted periodically to evaluate risk mitigation strategies and confirm adequate study fluid supplies, training, and resources to meet site needs.</p>

                <p id="Par91">The sample size for the BEST-Fluids trial (800 participants) is based on a comparison between two independent groups of the proportions of participants experiencing the primary outcome measure of DGF. The effect size, or minimum clinically important difference, was determined by considering that a relative risk (RR) reduction of approximately 25% (RR of 0.75) for the incidence of the primary outcome would be both clinically meaningful and within the range of biological plausibility for the association between DGF and Plasmalyte versus 0.9% saline. The latter is based on trends observed in (1) the Weinberg trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]: RR of dialysis within 48 h post-transplant of 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.28) and (2) a recently published before-and-after non-randomized interventional study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]: RR for dialysis within 48 h of 0.3 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.97; adjusted odds ratio 0.14; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.48), as the most current and relevant data available.</p>
                <p id="Par92">A sample size of 722 participants (361 per group) will have 80% power at a 5% two-sided significance level to show an estimated absolute difference between the groups of 10% (41% versus 31%), with an estimated overall incidence of DGF of 36% and RR for Plasmalyte versus 0.9% saline of 0.76. Allowing for 4.0% non-adherence (estimated 2% drop-out from the Plasmalyte group and 2% drop-in) and up to 1% loss to follow up for the primary outcome measure (e.g. due to death or withdrawal of consent within 7 days), an adjusted sample size of 792 participants is required. To allow for fluctuations in these estimates, a total of 800 participants will be recruited.</p>
                <p id="Par93">While the target recruitment allows for 1% loss to follow up, it is expected that loss to follow-up in this study for both the primary outcome (7 days) and secondary outcomes (up to 12 months) will be close to zero due to (1) the very close clinical follow up that renal transplant recipients routinely receive, (2) the short timeframe for ascertainment of the primary outcome (7 days post-transplant), and (3) the fact that transplant recipients are highly motivated patients who typically maintain strong engagement with their care providers.</p>

                <p id="Par94">BEST-Fluids is being conducted at 13 adult hospitals and 3 children’s hospitals that perform kidney transplants in Australia and New Zealand. Collectively these hospitals performed more than 500 deceased donor kidney transplants annually in the year prior to trial commencement; thus, approximately 50–55% of eligible patients overall need to be enrolled to meet the target sample size of 800 over 3 years.</p>
                <p id="Par95">Strategies have been implemented to achieve optimal participant enrolment: comprehensive site engagement with members of the multi-disciplinary clinical team prior to initiation of the trial, a pragmatic trial design with broad eligibility criteria, recruitment of participants by clinical staff who usually undertake the pre-operative assessments prior to transplant at each site, consent forms written in plain English (with interpreters available where required), a simple, rapid randomization process accessed online using ANZDATA, and the alignment of trial processes and the study intervention with usual clinical care. Each site has been provided with training on and resources for the trial, including short online randomization training videos to familiarize them with the ANZDATA Registry web-based platform used for enrolment. With few exceptions, participants are already being treated with dialysis and are registered in the ANZDATA Registry prior to being admitted for transplant, which greatly simplifies the process of enrolment. On-call 24-h telephone support is provided to clinical staff who are enrolling participants, with the ability to access assistance for enrolment and randomization from an investigator on the coordinating committee.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par130">Interventions that reduce the impact of delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney transplantation have the potential to improve transplant outcomes and reduce costs. This multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, pragmatic trial has been designed to determine whether the type of fluid therapy used peri-operatively in transplantation is important, specifically whether 0.9% saline given to a recipient exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion-injury-associated acute kidney injury and DGF, and whether using a balanced low-chloride alternative could prevent these adverse effects. Given that IV fluid therapy is both inexpensive and a critically important aspect of kidney transplant care, evidence for the superiority of Plasmalyte over 0.9% saline from this trial would provide strong justification for a change in clinical practice to using balanced crystalloids as the standard of care. Given the relatively large sample size and the expected generalizability of results to other transplant populations, a finding of no significant difference between the groups for the primary and key secondary outcomes with clinically important differences outside the bounds of the confidence intervals for effect estimates would imply that any benefit with balanced low-chloride crystalloids over 0.9% saline either does not exist, or is not clinically important for the majority of deceased donor kidney transplant recipients. Similarly, although the results of previous trials would make such findings unexpected, better outcomes with 0.9% saline would justify continuing with this type of fluid as the standard of care. Regardless, BEST-Fluids will provide important data on the relative safety of these two fluid types, particularly in relation to any electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia, or other peri-operative complications.</p>
              <p id="Par131">In keeping with the pragmatic study design, and to maximize the generalizability of the study findings, eligibility criteria were designed to enroll a broad range of deceased donor kidney transplant recipients, with an estimated incidence of DGF of 30–40%. It is estimated that &gt; 95% of deceased donor transplant recipients are eligible for this trial. Trial processes have been designed to be integrated into routine clinical care at participating hospitals, with multiple pragmatic aspects enabling transplant clinicians to easily enroll their patients without necessarily requiring the presence of research staff, and to prescribe the trial fluid intervention with maximum flexibility while maintaining a blinded treatment allocation. All data collected, apart from the quality of life questionnaires, are either already routinely collected or readily available in the clinical record; no additional laboratory tests or procedures are required for the trial.</p>
              <p id="Par132">By using a registry-based trial design, we sought to align trial processes with clinical practice using established registry data collection practices. Registry trial designs have a number of potential advantages in terms of increased efficiency, lower costs, alignment with standard clinical care, and reduction in investigator burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Staff at participating hospitals in BEST-Fluids are familiar with ANZDATA and the requirements of its data collection; 100% of renal units in Australia and New Zealand contribute data on patients treated with a kidney transplant. A purpose-built point-of-care data entry system for ANZDATA was rolled out to staff in renal units at around the time that recruitment commenced in the BEST-Fluids study; trial processes including enrolment, randomization and data collection have been incorporated into this system with the use of an additional integrated software module.</p>
              <p id="Par133">There are two other significant advantages of using the registry-based design. First, because ANZDATA contains data on all kidney transplant recipients in Australia and New Zealand, it will be possible to directly compare BEST-Fluids participants with the population of transplant recipients who are non-participants (who either had their transplant at a center not involved in the trial or who underwent transplantation at a participating hospital but are not enrolled for other reasons). This will enable an assessment of external validity and generalizability of the study findings through a comparison of patient characteristics and outcomes between these two groups. Second, all participants will continue to have data submitted to ANZDATA by local renal unit staff as per usual practice for death, graft failure, and other outcomes after the 12-month trial follow up ends, which will facilitate long-term follow up of trial participants at minimal cost.</p>
              <p id="Par134">An important consideration in the design for this trial was whether or not to exclude patients found to have hyperkalemia prior to enrolment. Pre-operative hyperkalemia is a not infrequent occurrence in patients with ESKD who are admitted for surgery, including transplantation. Some previous trials of low-chloride solutions versus 0.9% saline in transplant recipients have excluded patients with hyperkalemia (pre-operative serum potassium &gt; 5.5 mmol/L) due to concerns about the potassium content of low-chloride fluids (Plasmalyte, Ringers Lactate, and/or Elomel Isoton) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, the manufacturer of Plasmalyte recommends caution with its use in patients with hyperkalemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, these concerns have not been borne out in studies to date, which have not demonstrated increased hyperkalemia in patients receiving balanced low-chloride solutions. In the Weinberg trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], there was significantly less hyperkalemia in the Plasmalyte group, despite this study only excluding patients with untreated pre-operative potassium &gt; 6.0 mmol/L. It therefore seems likely that Plasmalyte does not cause clinically significant hyperkalemia despite its potassium content (5 mmol/L, similar to plasma). Moreover, the low-chloride concentration may confer a protective effect, even in the setting of poor graft function and oliguria, due to avoidance of hyperchloremic acidosis combined with the inclusion of gluconate and acetate anions as bicarbonate precursors. Potential trial participants with pre-operative hyperkalemia are therefore not excluded from BEST-Fluids, which is consistent with the pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria and will ensure maximum applicability of the trial findings. The protocol recommends that treating physicians actively manage and treat pre-operative hyperkalemia &gt; 6.0 mmol/L prior to transplant surgery (as would be considered usual clinical practice), thereby minimizing the potential risk. Hyperkalemia will be reported as an important secondary outcome for the trial.</p>
              <p id="Par135">In the protocol for BEST-Fluids originally approved by ethics committees and in operation at the time enrolment commenced in January 2018 (protocol version 2.0, 13 June 2017), the primary outcome measure was Early Kidney Transplant Function<italic>;</italic> a novel outcome measure incorporating two commonly used measures of DGF: (1) the duration of DGF in days in participants requiring dialysis and (2) the rate of transplant graft function recovery measured by creatinine reduction ratio on day 2 (CRR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] for participants who do not receive dialysis. After a review of the rates of recruitment, protocol adherence and DGF in the first 113 trial participants, the study protocol was amended in 2018 (Protocol version 3.0, 22 October 2018) to change the primary outcome to a binary outcome measure based simply on the incidence of DGF (defined as dialysis within 7 days of transplant) and increase the sample size from the original number of 574 to the current sample size of 800 participants. These changes were made to align the trial primary outcome with other, similar contemporary trials of interventions for DGF, and to make it easier for clinicians to interpret the trial results, with the ultimate goal of facilitating a rapid translation of the trial findings into practice. The original primary outcome has been retained as a key secondary outcome measure; further details of this outcome measure and the original sample size calculation are provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p>
              <p id="Par136">A particular strength of BEST-Fluids is its randomized, blinded design, with the use of minimization to ensure balance between treatment groups for relevant factors that impact the risk of the primary outcome of DGF. Blinding is particularly important for avoidance of bias in a trial of this type, where the primary outcome (DGF, the requirement for dialysis in the first post-transplant week) involves a clinical decision made by physicians caring for the patient. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in the incidence of DGF between centers, even after adjustment for patient-level and center-level characteristics, suggesting that local transplant practices and clinician propensity to utilize dialysis during the post-transplant period vary considerably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par137">There are some limitations that need to be considered. By design, BEST-Fluids does not mandate any specific approaches to the volume of IV fluid therapy to use either during surgery or in the post-operative period, and fluid volume may be an important risk factor for the development of DGF. In a recent trial of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, a liberal approach to fluid therapy was associated with a reduced risk of acute kidney injury compared with a more restrictive approach, in contrast to previous studies that had suggested that liberal fluid therapy was associated with inferior outcomes due to tissue edema, fluid overload, and other post-operative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Data on fluid volume and weight change are being collected in BEST-Fluids. Both the duration of cold ischemic time (from retrieval until implantation commences) and warm ischemic time (from rewarming to reperfusion of the graft following completion of vascular anastomoses) are major factors that affect the risk of DGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which are not incorporated into the randomization allocation algorithm as this information is not available at the time of enrolment into the study. However, the primary analysis of the effects of treatment on the primary outcome will be adjusted for total ischemic time, in addition to the minimization variables. Additional pre-specified analyses of the primary and key secondary outcomes will include separate adjustment for cold and warm ischemic times, fluid volume, and change in weight as a measure of fluid overload.</p>
              <p id="Par138">In conclusion, BEST-Fluids is an ongoing randomized, controlled, pragmatic, registry-based trial that will provide the most definitive comparative effectiveness data to date on DGF and other important clinical outcomes, using Plasmalyte versus 0.9% saline in deceased donor kidney transplantation. If the hypothesis that Plasmalye is superior to 0.9% saline is proven, this will provide an important and inexpensive means to improve transplant outcomes, which can be rapidly implemented into clinical practice.</p>
