                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a common mode of conception. Understanding the long-term implications for these children is important. The aim of this study was to determine the causal effect of IVF conception on primary school-age childhood developmental and educational outcomes, compared with outcomes following spontaneous conception.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>Causal inference methods were used to analyse observational data in a way that emulates a target randomised clinical trial. The study cohort comprised statewide linked maternal and childhood administrative data. Participants included singleton infants conceived spontaneously or via IVF, born in Victoria, Australia between 2005 and 2014 and who had school-age developmental and educational outcomes assessed. The exposure examined was conception via IVF, with spontaneous conception the control condition. Two outcome measures were assessed. The first, childhood developmental vulnerability at school entry (age 4 to 6), was assessed using the Australian Early Developmental Census (AEDC) (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 173,200) and defined as scoring &lt;10th percentile in ≥2/5 developmental domains (physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, communication skills, and general knowledge). The second, educational outcome at age 7 to 9, was assessed using National Assessment Program–Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) data (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 342,311) and defined by overall z-score across 5 domains (grammar and punctuation, reading, writing, spelling, and numeracy). Inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment was used to estimate population average causal effects.</p>
                  <p>The study included 412,713 children across the 2 outcome cohorts. Linked records were available for 4,697 IVF-conceived cases and 168,503 controls for AEDC, and 8,976 cases and 333,335 controls for NAPLAN. There was no causal effect of IVF-conception on the risk of developmental vulnerability at school-entry compared with spontaneously conceived children (AEDC metrics), with an adjusted risk difference of −0.3% (95% CI −3.7% to 3.1%) and an adjusted risk ratio of 0.97 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.25). At age 7 to 9 years, there was no causal effect of IVF-conception on the NAPLAN overall z-score, with an adjusted mean difference of 0.030 (95% CI −0.018 to 0.077) between IVF- and spontaneously conceived children. The models were adjusted for sex at birth, age at assessment, language background other than English, socioeconomic status, maternal age, parity, and education. Study limitations included the use of observational data, the potential for unmeasured confounding, the presence of missing data, and the necessary restriction of the cohort to children attending school.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In this analysis, under the given causal assumptions, the school-age developmental and educational outcomes for children conceived by IVF are equivalent to those of spontaneously conceived children. These findings provide important reassurance for current and prospective parents and for clinicians.</p>

              <p>In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a common mode of conception worldwide [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since the first successful IVF birth in 1978, more than 8 million babies have been born globally following IVF conception [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Australia, it is now estimated that 1 in 20 babies are born following IVF conception [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>As the number of children born following IVF conception continues to rise, a deeper understanding of the long-term implications for these children is important. It is well established that there are increased risks of maternal and perinatal complications following IVF conception [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Large cohort studies have suggested an increase in the frequency of congenital abnormalities, autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and intellectual disability in children conceived via IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) techniques [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, reports detailing longer term outcomes after IVF beyond the neonatal period remain sparse.</p>
              <p>Educational and cognitive outcomes following IVF conception have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Several small cohort studies [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have reported conflicting results. One large population-based study suggested a small difference in school performance in favour of spontaneous conception [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another population study recently concluded that school performance was not adversely affected by the process of IVF but, rather, the condition of subfertility [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Parents of IVF- and spontaneously conceived children possess inherently different health and sociodemographic characteristics [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Factors such as increased maternal age and higher education are known to be associated with both the use of fertility treatment and better early childhood outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is thus critical that such factors are appropriately acknowledged when examining the association between mode of conception and childhood outcomes. Proper adjustment in any statistical analysis is required before any association can be given a causal interpretation.</p>
              <p>Our study aimed to overcome some of the limitations of the analysis of observational (non-randomised) data by using a causal inference approach that seeks to emulate the results of a randomised comparison in a clinical trial (<xref rid="pmed.1004148.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This analytical approach attempts to simulate a randomised trial by (1) requiring an a priori statistical analysis protocol; (2) addressing a causal question reflecting the effect of an intervention at a specific clinical decision point on a prespecified outcome; and (3) using inverse probability weighting via propensity score (PS) models to balance the outcome propensity differences between exposed and control populations, with the aim of producing exchangeable comparison groups [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This allowed us to estimate the population-average effect of mode of conception (IVF versus spontaneous conception) on childhood developmental and educational outcomes with a causal interpretation. Our study aims to estimate the total causal effect of IVF conception on school-age childhood developmental and educational outcomes using a causal inference approach and employing the necessary assumptions.</p>

                  <p>The exposure was conception via IVF compared with spontaneous conception. The term “IVF” is used collectively to include both conventional IVF, IVF with ICSI, and associated laboratory techniques. IVF cases were identified through the IVF database. Victorian births not identified in the IVF database were allocated to the control group. Pregnancies recorded as “IVF conception” in the VPDC but not identified within the IVF database were excluded, ensuring the control group did not contain any IVF conceptions. These cases likely represent overseas or interstate IVF conceptions, Victorian IVF conceptions not captured by our database, or failed linkages between the IVF database and state birth records.</p>

The study cohort’s grade 3 NAPLAN (fourth year of primary school) results were investigated. For this study, an overall z-score was calculated and used as the primary outcome, with the individual domain z-scores examined as secondary outcomes. By a priori consensus, a mean z-score difference of 0.2 standard deviations was considered to be clinically relevant. Individual domain scores below the published national minimum standard (NMS) NAPLAN scores for each year and for each domain were analysed as secondary (binary) outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Covariates to be considered for inclusion in the statistical analysis models were decided a priori by the authorship team whose expertise included epidemiology, perinatology, reproductive endocrinology, and education. These covariates included child’s sex (as assigned at birth), child’s age in years at assessment, language background other than English (LBOTE), maternal age (at birth of the child), parity and both maternal and paternal highest obtained level of education, and socioeconomic status [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Gestational age at birth, mode of delivery, and birthweight were considered to be mediators on the causal pathways of interest and therefore not adjusted for in this analysis. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was created to describe the structure of the relationships between all variables and identify the adjustment variable set, in line with the methodology recommendations of Tennant and colleagues [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Data linkage was performed by the Centre for Victorian Data Linkage (CVDL), a third-party government-funded data linkage unit [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Probabilistic linkage was performed between the 5 individual databases—birth records, birthing outcomes, IVF records, AEDC, and NAPLAN. Post-linkage data were manually screened for false matches using secondary variables (e.g., residential postcode).

                <title>Causal assumptions</title>
                <p>The ATE (average treatment effect) estimand used in this study is based upon the Potential Outcomes Framework. If a set of assumptions is met, then causal interpretation can be made. The causal assumptions are counterfactual consistency, ignorability (conditional exchangeability), and positivity. Counterfactual consistency means that the definition of exposure is consistent for all individuals. Ignorability states that treatment assignment can be considered random after controlling for, conditioning on, a set of covariates [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. By identifying confounding variables, and importantly, the structure of the relationships between variables, via a DAG (<xref rid="pmed.1004148.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) and by performing appropriate statistical modelling to balance the population (for example, inverse probability weighting), observed populations can be considered exchangeable or “unconfounded.” Exchangeability requires that there are no important unmeasured confounders; this assertion is untestable. The positivity assumption means that for all observations, the conditional probability of being exposed (receiving treatment/no treatment) is greater than zero. This is likely violated if overlap of the control and exposed populations is poor [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
                <p>To best emulate a target trial, it must be possible for all participants to potentially receive both treatments. To ensure the assumptions underlying our causal approach were as robust as possible, we considered our observational data in direct comparison with the conditions of a target trial (<xref rid="pmed.1004148.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)</p>

                <title>Handling of missing data</title>
                <p>The proportions of missing data are described in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Data were missing for outcomes and covariates; there were no missing exposure data. Missing covariates and outcomes that were considered to either be missing completely at random or missing at random were imputed. Children identified as having special needs are not allocated an AEDC domain category and thus their outcome data is missing. Likewise, children who attend school but have a disability that precludes them from being able to appropriately participate in the NAPLAN are exempt from sitting the test; by definition, these children are below the NAPLAN national minimum standard for each domain from which they have been excluded. Outcome data for these children for both AEDC domain categories and NAPLAN z-scores was considered missing not at random. In the analysis of all primary and secondary AEDC outcomes, children with special needs have been included and assumed to be “developmentally vulnerable.” In the analysis of NAPLAN outcomes, “exempt” children have also been included and allocated either the lowest possible test z-score or deemed to be below the national minimum standard for binary NAPLAN domain outcomes.</p>

                <p>All covariates in the analysis model that had missing data were imputed, even if missing was very low. For the AEDC analysis, imputed covariates included parity, age at assessment, maternal education, Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA), and outcome score. For the NAPLAN analysis, imputed covariates included parity, age at assessment, maternal education, paternal education, SEIFA, and outcome score. Maternal body mass index (BMI) was excluded from imputation and analysis because the missingness was too high (&gt;50%). For AEDC imputation models, second parent education level (42% missing) was excluded due to non-convergence when included in the imputation model.</p>
                <p>Multiple imputation of missing data was performed under a fully conditional specification using a predictive mean model for continuous and unordered categorical covariates and a logistic model for binary covariates, with standard errors (SEs) accounting for maternal clustering (Methods, <xref rid="pmed.1004148.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and Figs A–C in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 File</xref>). The model contained outcome, exposure, model covariates, and auxiliary variables (AEDC: remote locality, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) status, and maternal country of origin; NAPLAN: ATSI status and maternal country of origin) along with interaction terms (exposure-parity, exposure-maternal age, exposure-age at assessment, gender-age at testing) and 1 higher order term (test age<sup>2</sup>). At 20 imputations, the Monte Carlo errors were less than 10% of corresponding SE for all covariates. Each imputation model was subjected to the recommended diagnostic tests [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>

                  <p>For each of the imputed datasets, the predicted probability of exposure or PS and associated inverse probability weight (IPW = 1/PS) were estimated using a logistic regression model, conditional on all analysis model covariates [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These weights were then stabilised by including as a factor in the numerator the proportion of each treatment group within the population, i.e., the prevalence of IVF and spontaneous conception [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Diagnostic tests performed after planned treatment effect modelling (Figs A–D in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 File</xref>) demonstrated poor overlap of exposed and non-exposed cohorts. We therefore restricted our analysis to the IVF population whose weights overlapped with the control group to ensure that the overlap (“positivity”) assumption was not violated. This reduced the IVF cases to 31.6% of the original AEDC cohort and 22.3% of the NAPLAN cohort. For each covariate, the standardised mean difference between the exposure arms was calculated to assess if balance between weighted pseudo-populations was achieved (Figs A and B in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 File</xref>).</p>
                  <p>For each imputed dataset, a doubly robust inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) model [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] was then used to estimate the respective potential outcome means (POM) followed by (1) the risk difference (RD) and relative risk (RR) for binary outcomes (AEDC and NAPLAN); and (2) mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes (NAPLAN z-score).</p>
                  <p>Finally, estimates for each imputed dataset were pooled to provide overall ATE with associated 95% confidence limits using Rubin’s method.</p>
                  <p>Provided the assumptions outlined above are satisfied, the estimates generated from these analyses can be interpreted as the population average causal effect, that is, the mean effect on the outcome if the treatment was applied to the entire population and contrasted with the outcome if the entire population received the control condition.</p>

                  <p>Sensitivity analyses were also performed to address identified sources of potential bias. For both AEDC (special needs status) and NAPLAN (exempt status) cohorts, sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) by excluding these cases completely; and (2) by imputing their outcomes (Fig A in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 File</xref>). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) modelling (a machine learning ensemble that is less sensitive to violations of positivity and does not require data distribution assumptions) was undertaken for comparison [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

              <p>The total cohort included 585,659 singleton births in Victoria between 2005 and 2014. Among this cohort, 173,200 children, including 4,697 IVF births, were linked to AEDC outcome data. Additionally, 342,331 children, including 8,976 IVF births, were linked to NAPLAN data (<xref rid="pmed.1004148.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Overall, a total of 11,059 IVF-conceived children and 401,654 spontaneously conceived children were included in the study (2,614 IVF cases and 100,184 controls were in both study arms). We estimate that our study cohort includes &gt;95% of IVF conceptions during the study timeframe (Tables A and B in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>). Analysis of the linked and non-linked cases showed little evidence of association between linkage and exposure status (Chi<sup>2</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.80); that is, IVF cases were just as likely to be included in the final linked cohort as controls. There were no births from 2014 that linked to outcome data.</p>

              <p>Baseline population characteristics differed considerably between the 2 exposure groups (<xref rid="pmed.1004148.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Compared with spontaneously conceived controls, children conceived via IVF had older, more highly educated parents and mothers with lower parity. IVF-conceived children resided in postal areas with higher socioeconomic ranking and were less likely to be from non-English speaking backgrounds. Age at assessment was similar between the exposure groups.</p>

                <p>Our findings suggest no causal effect of IVF conception on developmental vulnerability, with 13.6% of IVF-conceived children predicted to be developmentally vulnerable (&lt;10th percentile in 2 or more domains of the 5 AEDC domains) compared with 13.9% of spontaneously conceived children. The adjusted RD was at −0.3%, indicating that 0.3% fewer children who were conceived by IVF were developmentally vulnerable compared with those conceived spontaneously. However, the 95% CI (−3.7% to 3.1%), indicates this result is indistinguishable from zero. Similarly, the adjusted relative risk showed no detectable difference in risk of developmental vulnerability, where IVF-conceived children were 3.0% less likely to be developmentally vulnerable than spontaneously conceived children (RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.25) (<xref rid="pmed.1004148.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>Outcome data were missing for 5.6% of the AEDC-linked cohort. The vast majority (92%) of these missing cases were children with special needs (5.2% of overall cohort). There was no evidence of an association between the presence of missing outcome and exposure status (Chi<sup>2</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.68). Sensitivity analysis was performed by (1) excluding children with special needs; and (2) including these children, with multiple imputation of their missing outcomes (Tables A and B in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 File</xref>). Most covariates had minimal or no missing data (&lt;1.0%). Maternal education level was missing for 30.5% and maternal post-school education was missing for 31.6%.</p>

IVF-conceived children performed better on average in measures of writing than their spontaneously conceived peers with a z-score mean difference of 0.068 (95% CI 0.004 to 0.132), but this is unlikely to be a clinically important difference. The estimated effect is less than 0.07 of a standard deviation, and a difference of 0.2 standard deviations or greater was determined a priori as representing a finding of importance.</p>
                <p>Additionally, for each domain, a binary outcome (domain scores above or below the national minimum standard) was examined. In 4 of 5 domains (numeracy, reading, spelling, and writing), IVF-conceived children were less likely to be below the national minimum standard compared with their spontaneously conceived peers (<xref rid="pmed.1004148.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). For these 4 domains, the RD was between −0.7% and −1.25%. In absolute terms, this equates to approximately 1 additional IVF-conceived child, for every 100, predicted to score above the national minimum standard compared with their spontaneously conceived peers.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Using a causal inference approach, we found no effect of IVF conception on developmental vulnerability at school entry in Victorian children born between 2005 and 2014. Additionally, IVF-conceived children performed as well as their spontaneously conceived peers in school-based psychometric testing at age 7 to 9 years.</p>
              <p>For the first time, our study has estimated the causal effect of IVF conception on global childhood development at school entry and educational outcomes at primary school, under the assumptions of causal inference. Using an updated epidemiological approach [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], this study provides robust evidence about the longer term implications of IVF conception. The findings of this study offer timely reassurance about the impact of IVF conception on the developmental and educational outcomes at primary school age of the children conceived. Neither the outcomes of developmental vulnerability at school entry nor educational achievement at age 7 to 9 differed substantially between IVF- and spontaneously conceived children. Among 4 out of 5 NAPLAN individual domain national minimum standard results, there was a trend towards better performance in the IVF cases, but the clinical and social implications of these findings are difficult to quantify.</p>
              <p>Two large Scandinavian studies have reported on childhood outcomes following IVF conception. Norrman and colleagues found that IVF-conceived children perform worse on school-based assessment in year 9 [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], among their cohort of just over 8,000 IVF-conceived children. Wienecke and colleagues reported that IVF-conceived children had poorer school performance than controls and that spontaneously conceived children of subfertile parents also had poorer outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By examining a subpopulation of spontaneously conceived children of subfertile parents, the authors of this Danish study concluded that the IVF process itself was not responsible for the differences demonstrated [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>These past studies are limited by examining historical birth cohorts dating back prior to the year 2001. Our study examines a more contemporary birth cohort (2005 to 2014), which is important given the advances in artificial reproductive techniques that have occurred since the turn of the century. IVF technologies that have evolved since this time include the introduction of blastocyst culture, vitrification, and single-embryo transfer [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, our study findings are more generalisable to contemporary fertility practice. Importantly, our use of updated epidemiological and statistical methods ensures that we have estimated effects that have a causal interpretation. It is important that our methods are replicated in future studies to strengthen the existing evidence base.</p>
              <p>Given the use of observational data, there were missing data and inherent differences in the covariate profile of the exposure cohorts. An a priori SAP was developed to overcome these limitations. First, inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment was used to mimic exchangeable treatment and control comparison groups, similar to those that would be generated by randomisation in a controlled trial. The success of this procedure is demonstrated by achieving adequate covariate balance and thus sufficient overlap of covariate distributions between exposure groups after inverse probability weighting (Figs A–D in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 File</xref>). Second, we sought to mitigate the potential biases resulting from missing data. In order to do this, we performed multiple imputation of covariates included in our model and then compared the results of analyses that were based on complete cases with those of multiply imputed datasets (Tables A and B in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 File</xref>).</p>
              <p>It is possible that unmeasured common cause confounders may have led to bias in estimating the ATEs. Many important factors (socioeconomic status, maternal age, and education) were identified a priori, measured, and included in the estimation procedure. Potential known but unmeasured sources of bias include subfertility and maternal BMI. Current evidence suggests that subfertility is likely to be associated with poorer childhood outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consequently, if this variable were able to be measured and included in our causal model, correcting for it is likely to have favoured IVF-conceived children in our analysis. Maternal BMI is also likely to have followed the same trend with higher average BMI among the IVF group (after accounting for socioeconomic position) and high BMI being associated with poorer perinatal and childhood outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
              <p>Unmeasured variables may have had an impact on the outcome. Factors such as childcare attendance or grandparent involvement will be preceded on causal pathways by covariates that were measured and included in the model, such as maternal age and socioeconomic status [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These factors were therefore considered to mediate rather than confound the relationship between these covariates and the outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed to further evaluate unmeasured confounding, with E-values calculated for AEDC and NAPLAN primary outcomes. Within the limitation of E-values, these analyses indicate that it is unlikely an unknown bias exists without our knowledge and with the necessary magnitude of effect and prevalence to change our conclusions (Figs A and B in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 File</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
              <p>Generalisation of our findings to all IVF births is a potential study limitation. As described in our Methods, observations with non-overlapping PSs were excluded from analysis in order to meet the assumption of positivity, required for causal inference under the potential outcomes framework. Generalisation of our findings to all IVF births therefore requires the consideration that the baseline characteristics of the population of interest are comparable to the IVF cases analysed in our final cohort.</p>
              <p>Due to the use of school-based outcome assessments, our cohort was limited to children attending school. AEDC, as a triennial assessment, limited our sample to children captured during assessment years, and the later years of our birth cohort had not yet reached the assessment age for NAPLAN outcomes to be captured. However, our study included 70% of the relevant birth cohort for the study timeframe and in the years where both AEDC and NAPLAN data were available, over 95% of the Victorian birth cohort was sampled (Table A in <xref rid="pmed.1004148.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>). The remaining approximately 5% of children not sampled represent failed linkages as well as excluded IVF conceptions (due to non-Victorian IVF or non-IVF-assisted reproduction). A small percentage will also represent children with a disability significant enough not to attend mainstream school, introducing potential selection bias. Importantly, however, our study was not designed to assess severe disability or developmental delay, but rather an overall measure of global development and school achievement.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, through the examination of school-based outcomes, our study was inherently designed to examine outcomes for liveborn children. “Live birth bias” as it is known, is a recognised limitation of observational studies that investigate periconception and antenatal exposures [<xref rid="pmed.1004148.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For the purposes of this research question, the outcomes of failed conception, miscarriage, stillbirth are considered alternative endpoints and less relevant to the research question that aims to compare the school-age outcomes of children born following IVF conception with those who were conceived without assistance.</p>
              <p>Under the specified assumptions, this analysis has demonstrated that there is no causal effect within the population studied of IVF conception on early childhood developmental vulnerability and school-age educational outcomes. Compared with spontaneously conceived children, children conceived by IVF were no more likely to be developmentally vulnerable at school entry and had equivalent numeracy and literacy performance by age 7 to 9 years. These findings provide important reassurance for current and prospective parents and their treating clinicians.</p>

              <p>GENERAL</p>
              <p>in the context of the reviewer comments below, it might be necessary to revise your title</p>
              <p>Please do so according to PLOS Medicine's style. Your title must be nondeclarative and not a question. It should begin with main concept if possible. "Effect of" should be used only if causality can be inferred, i.e., for an RCT. Please place the study design ("A randomized controlled trial," "A retrospective study," "A modelling study," etc.) in the subtitle (ie, after a colon) </p>
              <p>Please ensure that the study is reported according to the STROBE guideline and include the completed STROBE checklist as Supporting Information. Please add the following statement, or similar, to the Methods: "This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (S1 Checklist)." The STROBE guideline can be found here: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/</ext-link> When completing the checklist, please use section and paragraph numbers, rather than page numbers.</p>
              <p>Thank you for including a prospective analysis plan, please include any changes made to the analyses-- including those made in response to peer review comments-- in the Methods section of the paper, with rationale.</p>
              <p>In the manuscript text, please indicate: (1) the specific hypotheses you intended to test, (2) the analytical methods by which you planned to test them, (3) the analyses you actually performed, and (4) when reported analyses differ from those that were planned, transparent explanations for differences that affect the reliability of the study's results. If a reported analysis was performed based on an interesting but unanticipated pattern in the data, please be clear that the analysis was data-driven.</p>
              <p>DISCUSSION</p>
              <p>Please remove sub-headings such that the discussion is presented follows: a short, clear summary of the article's findings; what the study adds to existing research and where and why the results may differ from previous research; strengths and limitations of the study; implications and next steps for research, clinical practice, and/or public policy; one-paragraph conclusion.</p>
              <p>Comments from the academic editor:</p>
              <p>1. I do not buy the causal language. All observational studies have potential for unmeasured confounders. I think the use and emphasis of causal language could actually distract attention from the main message, which I think is important. In fact, the unadjusted data indicate an apparent protective effect of IVF which disappears on adjustment (Table 2). It would be good to add 95% CI to the unadjusted analysis to see if this was beyond the play of chance. But it is apparent that measured parental characteristics are associated with an increased chance of using IVF and a decreased risk of poor educational outcome. Hence, it follows that unmeasured parental characteristics associated with an increased chance of using IVF and a decreased risk of poor educational outcome could be masking an adverse effect of IVF and the use of causal language is wrong.</p>
              <p>2. It would be good to have a positive control, i.e. data on a factor which we know is associated with educational outcome. That way we know their methods can detect an association if there is one there. Preterm birth is an obvious one. Perhaps an easy way to do this is to provide coefficients for all the covariables that they included in adjustment.</p>
              <p>3. It would actually be quite interesting to see what the results are if they applied a more commonly used method of multivariate adjustment, such as logistic regression or propensity score analysis just to see how different (if at all) the results are with the method they employ. Comments 2 and 3 could be addressed by providing a supplementary table of unadjusted and adjusted ORs from logistic regression to allow comparison.</p>
              <p>4. I agree with the comments of the statistician. But it is reassuring that their overall assessment is positive.</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1 (methodological reviewer): This aim of this study was to determine the causal effect of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) conception on primary schoolage childhood developmental and educational outcomes, compared with outcomes following spontaneous conception.</p>
              <p>Comments:</p>
              <p>"Covariates to be considered for inclusion in the statistical analysis models were decided a priori by the authorship team whose expertise included epidemiology, perinatology, reproductive endocrinology and education"</p>
              <p>The authors have satisfactorily adjusted for potential confounding in the analysis.</p>
              <p>"For the pre-specified statistical analysis plan (SAP) and the directed acyclic graph (DAG), see supplementary file (eFigure 1 in S3)."</p>
              <p>The authors have suitably provided the DAG in the supplementary material.</p>
              <p>Can the authors also please provide a copy of the SAP in the supplementary material (it is not currently clear if or where this is attached to the file)?</p>
              <p>"A doubly robust inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) model43,44 was used..."</p>
              <p>The authors have applied technically appropriate and rigorous statistical methods within the context of this research.</p>
              <p>"Provided assumptions are satisfied, the estimates generated from these routines can be interpreted as the population average causal effect"</p>
              <p>Can the authors please include a transparent and thorough discussion on the assumptions that are required for causal inferences to be drawn?</p>
              <p>"Analysis involved detailed examination of missing data, consideration of missing outcome data, multiple imputation of missing covariate data, consideration of clustering within mothers and adjustments to effect size modelling. Finally, sensitivity analysis was also performed to address identified sources of potential bias."</p>
              <p>Can the authors please provide more detail on these important analyses within the main article here?</p>
              <p>"Overall, a total of 11,059 IVF-conceived children and 401,654 spontaneously conceived children were included in the study (2,614 IVF cases and 100,184 controls were in both study arms)."</p>
              <p>Whilst the authors have examined that "Analysis of the linked and nonlinked cases showed little evidence of association between linkage and exposure status (p = 0.80); that is, IVF cases were just as likely to be included in the final linked cohort as controls", can the authors please further comment on whether the final included samples analysed in this study can be considered to be representative of the wider populations of interest within the context of this research?</p>
              <p>"Outcome data were missing for 5.6% of the AEDC-linked cohort. The vast majority (92%) of these missing cases were children with special needs (5.2% of overall cohort). There was no evidence of an association between the presence of missing outcome and exposure status (p = 0.68). Sensitivity analysis was performed by 1) excluding children with special needs and 2) including these children, with multiple imputation of their missing outcomes (see supplementary file: eTable 4 and 5 - Sensitivity Analysis (AEDC) in S11 and s12). "</p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p>"Spontaneously conceived children were more likely to have missing NAPLAN data (7.6%) than IVF-conceived children (5.9%, p&lt;0.001). During the primary analysis, missing outcomes related to a child being absent or withdrawing from the test, were imputed. The results presented include 7,222 children who were exempt from sitting the NAPLAN, with their results set to the lowest possible outcome score. Sensitivity analysis was performed by 1) excluding these children and 2) including the exempt cases, with multiple imputation of their missing outcomes. There was no meaningful difference in the results (see supplementary file: eTable 6 and 7 - Sensitivity Analysis (NAPLAN) in S13 and S14). "</p>
              <p>The authors have appropriately communicated and handled missing outcome data within the analysis.</p>
              <p>"Maternal education level was missing for 30.5% and maternal post-school education was missing for 31.6%."</p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p>"Second parent school education level was missing in 13.8% of cases and post-school education missing in 15.4% of cases. "</p>
              <p>Whilst the authors discuss missing data in the discussion of the study limitations, can the authors please clarify and expand on how they dealt with missing covariate data in the Methods and Results sections?</p>
              <p>Overall, the results are presented clearly and the main study limitations have been thoroughly addressed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors report the lack of an association of IVF with later childhood educational outcomes using routinely collected data from Australia. This is an extremely well conducted and well written study, with robust and appropriate sensitivity analyses which adds substantially to the field and will reassures many parents. </p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>The authors make a big deal of the causal analysis, and I would suggest statistical review to confirm the appropriateness of the methodology and causal claims. I am conscious that the same used to be said regarding matching and that has now shown to be incorrect. I was not convicned that teh paper would materially suffer by removing the "casual anlaysis" claims in the title or intorudction etc. </p>
              <p>I wondered if graphical representation of the results would further enhance the paper. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This study examined associations of ART conception with School-age outcomes using register data from Australia. The authors should be commended for trying to provide more reliable causal evidence from observational data, something we should all be doing. I have only a few minor comments</p>
              <p>eTable 1 should be brought into the main paper and / or a separate section in the methods should be added on the target trial emulation procedure</p>
              <p>Where is the study protocol published / date it was published?</p>
              <p>In line with the glossary, the exposure of interest should be referred to as ART rather than IVF</p>
              <p>The aim of the study was to emulate a target trial however, baseline characteristics differed considerably between the treatment groups. Can you describe the implications of this. Does it mean that trial emulation failed? Is there a way you can try to fix this?</p>
              <p>If data are available, it would be of interest to present results separately for fresh and frozen embryo transfers. Please consider this.</p>

              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Many thanks to the authors for satisfactorily considering and responding to each comment in turn, suitably amending the manuscript as requested.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I would stand by my comments that removal of the causal claim in the title would improve the paper, I am not a fan of playing different referees of each other several of us have highlighted that the causal language may be overstated. </p>
              <p>"School-age outcomes among IVF-conceived children" is snappier and cuts to the chase.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: I am grateful for the opportunity to review this interesting and innovative study that seeks to estimate the total causal effect of conception by assisted reproductive technology on educational outcomes in school-age children. I was approached to provide a methodological review of the appropriateness and accuracy of the causal inference methods as well as the reporting and use of language. My review will focus primarily on these points.</p>
              <p>Overall, I believe the study is has been well conducted and the research team should be commended for their hard work and diligence. I believe the research is scientifically sound but I believe the quality of the manuscript could be improved with some language and presentational changes as detailed below.</p>
              <p>1) TITLE: 'a causal inference analysis' is a vague term. I think it would be better for the study to be described more precisely as something like, 'a target trial emulation study using augmented inverse probability of treatment weighting'.</p>
              <p>2) INTRODUCTION, METHODS, AND RESULTS: A causal inference approach encourages a focus on interval estimation rather than (null) hypothesis testing. I therefore find it somewhat strange that the study states a null hypothesis at the end of the introduction and goes on to report null-distribution p-values. I think it would be less jarring if the authors instead described their aim/s as something more like 'to estimate the total causal effect of conception by IVF on the risk of developmental vulnerability'. Similar language would apply in the methods and results, e.g. rather than saying that 'The null hypothesis of no causal effect of IVF conception on developmental vulnerability was supported by our findings…' the study would simply report something like 'the estimated total causal effect of conception by IVF on the risk of developmental vulnerability was indistinguishable from zero (risk difference = -0.3%, 95% CI: -3.7% to 3.1%)'. </p>
              <p>3) INTRODUCTION (lines 127-140): Although a target trial emulation study is indeed designed to 'mimic' a randomized controlled trial, I think this wording is likely to raise unfortunate associations among readers familiar with poorly-conducted propensity score analyses as 'mimicking randomised controlled trials'. I would therefore recommend toning down the language a little and simply stating that the study aimed to emulate a target trial by using the method introduced by Hernan et al with the augmented inverse probability of treatment weighting estimator. Similarly, I don't particularly like the language of achieving 'balance' in the distribution of baseline characteristic, in part because this is not what propensity score methods do (they aim to balance the outcome propensities, not the covariates). Comments about how this is 'similar to what occurs when participants are randomised' may be theoretically true, but this is unlikely to ever be achieved in practice. That said, I commend the authors for being clear about their causal aims. As outlined by Haber et al 2022 (Causal and Associational Language in Observational Health Research: A Systematic Evaluation) it is important for researchers to be clear where they seek to estimate a causal effect. It is just not necessary to 'over egg' this ambition or the methods used to achieve this aim. Thus, it is good to state an aim to 'estimate the total causal effect of conception by IVF on developmental vulnerability', and interpret the results as 'estimates of' this total causal effect, but perhaps not so good to start talking about 'mimicking randomised controlled trials'.</p>
              <p>4) METHODS: I would prefer the target trial emulation table to be presented in the main manuscript. I believe Plos Medicine is an online-only journal, so I see no reason why this should not be possible. </p>
              <p>5) METHODS: There is a gap between the allocation and completion of the treatment because the conception must survive until live birth to be counted as belonging to either exposure group. In the target trial, what would happen to the pregnancies that don't result in live birth? I expect there will be an unequal chance of surviving to live birth between the in-vivo and in-vitro conceptions, creating the chance of selection bias. This ought to be acknowledged as a potential source of bias or, ideally, accounted for as competing events. </p>
              <p>6) METHODS: In terms of exclusion criteria, what happened to the twins and other multiple pregnancies? I cannot see them described in the exclusion criteria. </p>
              <p>7) METHODS: Regarding the target trial table, I think the authors could be more explicit in both the target trial and (in particular) the emulation study columns. I know it seems strange, but where the details of the emulation study are identical to the target trial, this really ought to be explicitly stated (either by repeating the details or simply saying 'same as for the target trial'). For example, if the inclusion criteria for the trial are 'all couples wanting to conceive and weight the ability to conceive' then the emulation column should repeat the same. In general, the emulation column does not really seem to state the expected criteria. E.g. the assignment procedures box should summarise your method for achieving conditional exchangeability and your causal contrasts box should start the target estimands. The recent paper by Matthews et al in the BMJ (Target trial emulation: applying principles of randomised trials to observational studies) offers a little help here about what should be mentioned in the table.</p>
              <p>8) METHODS: I think that the supplementary methods should be included in the main manuscript, which is currently rather light on details.</p>
              <p>9) METHODS, RESULTS, and throughout: Since this study uses a DAG, I believe it would benefit from following the reporting recommendations outlined in Tennant et al 2021 (Use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to identify confounders in applied health research: review and recommendations). </p>
              <p>10) METHODS and RESULTS: The authors present 'crude' associations in the non-weighted sample. I believe these results may have been added on the instruction of a previous reviewer, as per traditional. Alas, these associations should not be reported as they are likely to be extremely biased and prone to misinterpretation. Only the best estimate of the target estimands should be reported in the main manuscript. All sub-analyses involving alternative estimators (whether unweighted logistic regression, TLME, or - if absolutely necessary - the unweighted and unconditional analyses) should be reserved for the supplementary materials. </p>
              <p>11) RESULTS: Null hypothesis significance testing is strongly discouraged in epidemiological analyses. The null-distribution p-values are therefore unnecessary and do not need to be reported. The authors may wish to present their E-values alongside the point estimates and confidence intervals instead.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Lindquist,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "School-age outcomes among IVF-conceived children." (PMEDICINE-D-22-02257R3) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with my colleagues and the academic editor and it was also seen again by 1 reviewer. I am pleased to say that provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.  </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript by Nov 17 2022 11:59PM.   </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>1) Thank you for revising your title in context of previous reviewer comments. With these in mind, please revise your title according to PLOS Medicine's style. Your title must be nondeclarative and not a question. It should begin with main concept if possible. "Effect of" should be used only if causality can be inferred, i.e., for an RCT. Please place the study design ("A randomized controlled trial," "A retrospective study," "A modelling study," etc.) in the subtitle (ie, after a colon).</p>
              <p>2) Where you report adjusted analyses in data tables 3, 4 and 5 of the main manuscript, please also include the unadjusted analyses, either within an additional column in the existing tables or as additional supplementary files.</p>
              <p>3) Thank you for updating your data availability statement. Please ensure that the URL is placed in the manuscript submission form when you re-submit your manuscript.</p>
              <p>4) Thank you for including twitter handles. Please also ensure that these are placed in the manuscript submission form when you re-submit your manuscript.</p>
              <p>5) Please remove the COI and data availability statements from the end of the main manuscript and include only in the manuscript submission form</p>
              <p>6) Throughout, please replace "Fig" with "Figure", including in the supplementary files</p>
              <p>7) Please define DV2 in supplementary figures 13 and 14 - please check throughout and ensure all abbreviations are clearly defined within relevant capitions.</p>
              <p>Comments from the Academic Editor:</p>
              <p>The authors have done a nice job with revisions and happy to move to accept</p>

              <p>2) Please add the following statement, or similar, to the Methods: "This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (S1 Checklist)." When you re-submit please indicate where in the manuscript this sentence has been placed.</p>
              <p>3) In addition please remove spaces between in text reference callouts (e.g. line 99 "...conception [2, 3]." should read, "...conception [2,3]."</p>
              <p>4) Please define all abbreviations in figure 1 in an appropriate figure caption</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email.
