              <abstract>
                <p>Given the growing evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the etiology of depression, a ‘lifestyle medicine’ approach can be potentially safe and cost-effective to prevent or treat depression. To examine the effects and acceptability of a group-based, integrative lifestyle medicine intervention as a standalone treatment for managing depressive symptoms, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in a Chinese adult population in 2018. Participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31) with PHQ-9 score above the cut-off of ≥ 10, which was indicative of moderate to severe depression, were recruited from the general community in Hong Kong and randomly assigned to lifestyle medicine group (LM group) or care-as-usual group (CAU group) in a ratio of 1:1. Participants in the LM group received 2-hour group sessions once per week for six consecutive weeks, which covered diet, exercise, mindfulness, psychoeducation, and sleep management. Linear mixed-effects model analyses showed that the LM group had a significant reduction in PHQ-9 scores compared to the CAU group at immediate posttreatment and 12-week posttreatment follow-up (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.69 and 0.73, respectively). Moreover, there were significantly greater improvements in anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms (measured by DASS-21 and ISI) at all time points in the LM group (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.42–1.16). The results suggests that our 6-week group-based, integrative lifestyle intervention program is effective in lowering depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms in the Chinese population. Further studies in clinical populations with a larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Depression is a common mental disorder which is characterized by a prolonged depressed mood, loss of interest, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, poor concentration, and recurring thoughts of suicide [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Depression significantly reduces an individual’s quality of life and is associated with higher mortality [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It was estimated that over 300 million people suffered from depression, equivalent to 4.4% of the world’s population [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A recent 10-year prospective cohort study by Ni et al. suggested that the prevalence of probable depression had risen from 6.5% in 2017 to 11.2% in 2019 in the Hong Kong adult population [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], depression has a major impact on health and society and is projected to be one of the three leading causes of global disease burden by 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Lifestyle factors are increasingly recognized as important to mental health, in which healthy lifestyles have a positive impact on improving depression and anxiety as shown in prospective studies [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258059.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Some researchers have begun to explore the effectiveness of lifestyle medicine (LM) for promoting mental health. LM is a relatively new medical specialty, which is generally defined as the prevention and treatment of disease by changing personal habits and behavioral choices of individuals in order to address the underlying causes [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the past, LM mainly focused on the prevention, management, and treatment of physical diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258059.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Within the last decade, growing evidence has found that depression has a significant lifestyle-driven component [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and sleep, are found to be significant mediating factors for the development, progression, and treatment of depression [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A review by Berk and colleagues (2013) also reported that lifestyle factors, such as poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, smoking and substance abuse, contribute to depression risk [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to the review by Sarris et al., lifestyle elements that have sound evidentiary support for managing depression include good dietary and sleep quality, adequate physical activity and mindfulness-based practice, and avoidance of harmful substances (e.g., smoking, alcohol, or illicit substances) [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>Specifically, recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrated that healthy diet patterns, usually characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables, fish, and whole grains, were significantly associated with a reduced depression risk [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A meta-analysis conducted by Firth et al. demonstrated that dietary interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The effect of physical activity as a treatment for depression was reported in several reviews [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In a recent meta-analysis of 27 systematic reviews (including 16 meta-analyses representing 152 RCTs) which investigated exercise interventions with aerobic exercise, high-intensity exercise, and resistance training, reported that exercise reduced depression in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) across different age groups [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, studies also demonstrated that the effect of exercise as a treatment for depression was comparable to first-line treatments, such as medications and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Treatment for insomnia is usually recommended as part of the treatment for depression, given the high co-occurrence of insomnia and depression [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A review study of several meta-analyses demonstrated that CBT for both insomnia and depressive symptoms was safe and effective, and its efficacy exerted stable long-term effects as evidenced by longitudinal follow-ups [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Mindfulness is another lifestyle element that has growing evidence for its efficacy in treating depression. A comprehensive meta-analysis of RCTs of Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) in patients who experienced a current episode of MDD reported that participants receiving MBIs showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms at post-intervention assessment, compared to the control group [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another meta-analysis of 142 RCTs demonstrated strong evidence that the effects of MBI were equivalent to those of existing evidence-based treatments for depression [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>Supported by the growing evidence which acknowledges the significance of lifestyle factors associated with depression, it is proposed that LM could offer a potentially safe and cost-effective treatment option for the prevention, management, and treatment of depression [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258059.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Nonetheless, existing studies on lifestyle modifications for depression are largely limited to individual lifestyle components or either cross-sectional or longitudinal data. Thus, interventional clinical trials using a multi-component integrative LM approach for depression is very limited. Previous RCTs have only examined the effects of LM interventions delivered merely through written recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258059.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Other RCTs were conducted among depressed older-adults through individual calls and visits [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258059.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Recently, some researchers started to develop integrated lifestyle programs, such as Healthy Body Healthy Mind (HBHM) [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, there is no RCT investigating a group-based, integrative LM intervention in the adult population for depression.</p>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first pilot RCT of an integrative, group-based lifestyle intervention for depressed adults not on current treatment. The aims of this study were to (1) examine the effects and acceptability of an integrative LM intervention for the management of depressive symptoms in a Chinese adult population and (2) inform the study design and sample size calculation for future fully powered trials.</p>

                <p>This prospective study was a pilot RCT on the effects of lifestyle medicine as a standalone treatment for managing depressive symptoms. Thirty-one eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the lifestyle medicine group (LM group) or the care-as-usual group (CAU group) in a ratio of 1:1. The study was reviewed and approved by the Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee (SBREC) of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Reference No. SBRE-18-055). The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT03720145), and the RCT followed Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for non-pharmacological interventions.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited from the community through social media sites and university mass mails from October 2018 to November 2018. Eligible participants were screened on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: (1) aged 18 or above; (2) Hong Kong residents with proficiency in Cantonese; (3) Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score above the cut-off of ≥ 10 [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; and (4) a willingness to provide informed consent and comply with the trial protocol. Participants were excluded if they (1) were pregnant; (2) had suicidal ideations based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) Item 9 score ≥ 2 (referral information to professional services was provided to those who endorsed items on suicidal ideation); (3) were using medication or psychotherapy for depression; or (4) were diagnosed with having any major psychiatric, medical or neurocognitive disorder(s) that made participation unsuitable, or interfered with the adherence to the lifestyle modification where exercise or a change in diet were not recommended by physicians.</p>

                <title>Study procedure</title>
                <p>Potential participants were enrolled by providing online informed consent and completing an online screening survey using the Qualtrics platform. Eligible participants were then contacted by a research assistant to explain the screening results and study procedures and confirm their availability to participate in the group treatment. Those who were available for the study were randomly assigned to either the LM group or the CAU group. Block randomization with a block size of 4 was performed by an independent assessor using a computer-generated list of numbers in Excel. Allocation concealment was achieved by storing the randomization sequence in a secure electronic file which was inaccessible to the study investigators and therapists. Due to the study nature, blinding of participants and therapists was not possible. Participants in the LM group received the 2-hour group lifestyle intervention at the Chinese University of Hong Kong once per week for 6 consecutive weeks from November to December of 2018. They did not receive other care during the study period; however, referral was provided to those who need more intensive interventions based on the team’s clinical judgment. The CAU group did not receive the lifestyle intervention but continued receiving care as usual, defined broadly as anything patients would normally receive. There were no restrictions regarding the care they received during the study. A list of mental health services available in the community (e.g., regional psychiatric centres and non-governmental organizations), public hospitals, and emergency contact were provided to the participants. Both the LM group and the CAU group completed the same set of online questionnaires at 3 time points: baseline (Week 0), immediate posttreatment (Week 6), and 12-week posttreatment follow-up (Week 18). All data were collected using an in-house smartphone application called Longitudinax. For the participants who have completed all outcome assessments, a cash incentive of HKD 100 was offered for each participant after completing all study procedures.</p>

                <p>The intervention protocol was modified and enhanced from the Healthy Body Healthy Mind (HBHM) integrative lifestyle program, which was designed to integrate five evidence-based lifestyle components, including diet, exercise, mindfulness, psychoeducation, and sleep management, alongside motivational and goal setting skills and lifestyle psychoeducation [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The program consisted of 2-hour group sessions conducted in person once per week for six consecutive weeks. Moreover, the intervention protocol used in this pilot study was adapted to the local culture and lifestyle, particularly on diet. For example, Chinese dietary recommendations were primarily based on Guangdong dishes, soups, and herbal tea. Handouts which consisted of treatment content of each session, exercises (e.g., QR codes that linked to relaxation and mindfulness), and record forms were distributed to the LM group and the CAU group during each session and at the end of the study, respectively. The content outline is summarized in <xref rid="pone.0258059.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. The group treatment was primarily delivered by a clinical psychology trainee under the on-site supervision of a clinical psychologist. Other instructors included a dietitian, a physical instructor, and a Chinese medicine practitioner. Prior to the beginning of and during the 6-week treatment period, a research assistant encouraged treatment compliance and daily practices of lifestyle modifications by sending text reminders to participants between sessions.</p>

The between-group difference in the proportion of participants who attained clinically significant improvement was performed by the Fisher’s Exact Test. Linear mixed-effects models (LMM) were used to compare the treatment effect between the LM group and CAU group from baseline (Week 0) to immediate posttreatment (Week 6) and 12-week follow-up assessments (Week 18). Fundamental assumptions of LMM (e.g., normality, validity of the model, independence of data points) were tested to ensure the accuracy of test results. In the sensitivity analysis, only participants who had completed at least 80% of the sessions (i.e., at least 5 out of 6 sessions) were included for testing the effects of the lifestyle intervention.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this was the first RCT to explore the effects of a truly integrative LM intervention in a group basis on adults with depressive symptoms who were not on current medication or psychological treatment. The present study aimed to examine the effects and acceptability of a group-based, integrative LM intervention in a Chinese (Hong Kong) sample of adults with depressive symptoms, and provided estimates of effect sizes for future fully powered studies. Our findings tentatively suggested that the LM intervention, compared to CAU, could effectively reduce depressive symptoms. The effect sizes at both the end of the intervention and the follow up time point were medium, thereby indicating a notable clinical effect. Using different assessments of clinically significant improvement (50% reduction or 5-point drop from baseline PHQ-9 scores), our findings showed mixed results. For 50% score reduction, there was an insignificant difference in the proportion of participants achieved clinically meaningful improvement between the LM group and the CAU group at both immediate posttreatment (Week 6) and 12-week follow-up assessment (Week 18). In contrast, 5-point drop from baseline PHQ-9 score revealed significantly higher proportions of participants achieving clinical improvements at immediate posttreatment. However, on a cautionary note, the sample size was small (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31), which limited the interpretation of these findings. Taken into account of the small sample size, we proposed the following explanations. The absence of clinically significant difference using 50% score reduction between the two groups from baseline to immediate posttreatment (Week 6) assessments may be explained by the readiness and commitment to change personal habits. Lifestyle modifications take time to implement and turn into habits or daily routine, thus it is expected that the impacts of lifestyle modifications on depression are likely to occur gradually if an individual persists over a longer period of time. Significant improvements were also found in anxiety and stress symptoms as well as insomnia severity. Encouragingly, no adverse effects resulting from the LM intervention were reported in this study. In line with the meta-analysis and recent RCTs, we showed that LM interventions were superior to CAU in managing depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258059.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
              <p>In alignment with results of previous RCTs examining LM interventions for depressed adults, the results of the current study also supported that LM is a safe and effective standalone treatment for depression. Our result (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.73 at the 12-week follow-up assessment) was comparable to the 12-week multi-domain lifestyle modification intervention delivered through home visits and telephone calls for depressed older adults, which reported that the LM group resulted in a greater reduction of depressive symptoms among depressed older adults than their counterparts who received usual care (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.70) [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although another RCT with four hygienic-dietary recommendations including exercise, diet, sun exposure and sleep as an add-on treatment of depression demonstrated a larger effect size at the 6-month follow-up (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.89) [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the findings could not be replicated by an RCT with a larger sample size and longer follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The researchers suggested that the intervention, in which the lifestyle recommendations were solely delivered in written form and without any monitoring systems of their implementation, could be too limited in motivating depressed patients to accomplish the lifestyle changes. On the other hand, one of the key factors that contributed to the significant improvement in depressive symptoms in our study could be the goal-setting strategies employed in the intervention. Strong evidence indicated that by setting specific and realistic goals, discussing problem-solving skills to remove barriers, and providing some levels of supervision, depressed patients would be more likely to adopt the proposed behavioral changes [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, techniques such as motivational interviewing are likely to be effective in engaging depressed patients to move toward desirable lifestyle changes [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the current treatment protocol, we have integrated elements of motivational interviewing and SMART goal-setting in each treatment session. After learning the rationale and practical recommendations for lifestyle modifications, participants were guided to explore their ambivalence to change, learn practical problem-solving skills to overcome potential barriers, and set specific and achievable goals for the coming week. Log sheets were provided to encourage participants to record their daily practice of lifestyle modifications. In the last session, participants were guided to set short-, medium-, and long-term goals for continuous implementation or maintenance of the lifestyle modifications. These goal-setting strategies were believed to continuously motivate and engage our participants in lifestyle modifications throughout the study.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the results of the present study are also in line with a meta-analysis that supported the effectiveness of group therapy for depression (<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> = 0.68) [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Researchers have highlighted many advantages of group psychotherapy, such as normalizing one’s experiences through identification with others, positive reinforcement, vicarious learning in a safe environment, and the experience of mastery through suggesting solutions for other group members [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Lewinsohn and Clarke (1999) suggested that, by observing others undertaking certain changes, other group members would be more likely to attempt [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Our study was conducted in groups, participants were encouraged to participate in interactive group discussions in every treatment session. It was observed that participants were in general willing to share their experience of implementing lifestyle changes in their daily lives and were able to support each other through normalization and exchange of supportive feedback. Thus, one’s success story could positively reinforce behavioral changes in others. We believe these therapeutic factors of group therapy have also contributed to the effects of our group-based LM intervention. Lastly, group-based LM interventions have a huge advantage over individual interventions in terms of cost-effectiveness as they represented only 8–17% of the cost of individual therapies [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p>
              <p>Regarding the completion rate of the treatment, only 12.5%, 37.5% and 80% of the participants in the LM group achieved 100%, 80% and 50% attendance rate, respectively. Reasons of absence included busy at work or study, time clash with other activities, and feeling physically unwell. It is reflected by some of our participants that as our 6-week treatment overlapped with the university’s examination period, they encountered difficulties in sparing time for the treatment sessions. The venue of the treatment (i.e., the university), which was away from the city centre, could also be one of the barriers for attending treatment sessions. One participant commented that it took much travel time to attend the sessions, which eventually led to her decision to drop out during the treatment. It is recommended that future studies shall take the mode of delivery (such as delivering remotely via online or smartphone app) into considerations in order to facilitate a higher level of adherence. Moreover, it may also encourage treatment adherence by decreasing the duration or the number of treatment sessions.</p>
              <p>Given the large variance of attendance rate, a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the treatment effects among participants who had higher adherence rate (i.e., at least 5 out of 6 treatment sessions). This group of participants showed large effect sizes at the two time points. Effect sizes of anxiety, stress, and insomnia were also larger in this group. Besides, significant improvements in health-related quality of life and functioning were only found in this group. This preliminary result suggested that treatment adherence is crucial in the treatment effects of LM. While a low level of motivation is one of the common symptoms of depression that could hinder treatment adherence and in turn decrease treatment effectiveness, it is suggested that motivational strategies, such as motivational interviewing, goal-setting and behavioral activation, should be considered as standard to encourage participation in future studies.</p>
              <p>Lastly, treatment credibility and expectancy were measured and analyzed in the present study. It was found that treatment credibility, as measured by “how believable, convincing, and logical the treatment is”, significantly increased after the intervention. This indicated that the participants in general became more convinced of the treatment rationale and more confident in recommending LM interventions to friends who also experience depressive symptoms. However, no significant changes were found from pre-treatment to post-treatment regarding participants’ subjective beliefs and feelings about the improvements in their functioning through the LM intervention. It indicated that participants’ expectancy on the intervention generally remained unchanged across the treatment.</p>

                <title>Limitations and future directions</title>
                <p>Besides the small sample size due to the pilot nature of this trial that required cautious interpretations, there were other limitations in this study. First of all, we opted to use PHQ-9 as a screening tool instead of an independent clinical evaluation by a clinician. The majority of our participants were students, whose depressive symptoms as measured by PHQ-9 could have been induced by stress from temporary study workload and resolved on its own in due time. Therefore, regression to the mean could have occurred that resulted in the detected clinical improvement. The improvement in the CAU group also pointed to this phenomenon. To eliminate this confounding variable, we proposed that future replication studies could consider applying PHQ-9 screening a second time after the initial screening for reliability. Only participants who consistently showed increased PHQ-9 levels would be recruited. With respect to the association of treatment adherence to treatment effects, we did not ask our participants to report their applications of lifestyle modifications (e.g., the amount of time doing exercise or mindfulness practice) in their daily life. While adherence to lifestyle interventions that include behavior changes in daily life can influence the effects of such interventions, it is recommended that common objective measures of adherence, including pedometers and other physiological measurement tools such as heart rate monitors, could be included in future studies to examine the relationship of treatment adherence with treatment effects [<xref rid="pone.0258059.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The low completion rate and attendance rate in the present study were also one of the limitations. Future studies are advised to incorporate additional motivational strategies and eliminate possible barriers to treatment to enhance treatment adherence. In order to systematically investigate potential factors related to treatment adherence and reasons for dropout, independent assessments by third party or focus group discussions may be considered in future studies. Given that lifestyle modifications take time to integrate into daily routine naturally, and their impacts on depressive symptoms through complex physiological mechanisms could also take time to realize, it would be of interest to provide a potentially longer (flexible) intervention, with a longer follow up period and multiple time points to examine the sustained effects of LM modifications for the management of depression.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In conclusion, to our best knowledge, our study was the first pilot RCT to examine the effects of integrated LM intervention in managing depressive symptoms in the Chinese population. We demonstrated that the group-based, integrated LM intervention could be an effective and acceptable treatment option for depressed adults. Further evaluation of fully powered RCTs is warranted to evaluate the robustness of LM interventions for depression (potentially via an online or smartphone app delivery). With further support from future studies, LM interventions could well be considered as a safe and cost-effective treatment option for the prevention, management, and treatment of depression in community mental health services.</p>
