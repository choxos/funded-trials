                  <p id="Par1">Cardiotocography is almost ubiquitous in its use in intrapartum care. Although it has been demonstrated that there is some benefit from continuous intrapartum fetal monitoring using cardiotocography, there is also an increased risk of caesarean section which is accompanied by short-term and long-term risks to the mother and child. There is considerable potential to reduce unnecessary operative delivery with up to a 60% false positive diagnosis of fetal distress using cardiotocography alone. ST analysis of the fetal electrocardiogram is a promising adjunct to cardiotocography alone, and permits detection of metabolic acidosis of the fetus, potentially reducing false positive diagnosis of fetal distress.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study will be a single-centre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, conducted over 3 years. The primary hypothesis will be that the proportion of women with an emergency caesarean section on ST analysis will not equal that for women on cardiotocography monitoring alone. Participants will be recruited at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital, a high-risk specialty facility with approximately 5000 deliveries per annum. A total of 1818 women will be randomised to the treatment or conventional arm with an allocation ratio of 1:1, stratified by parity. The primary outcome is emergency caesarean section (yes/no). Statistical analysis will follow standard methods for randomised trials and will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes will also be analysed. Additional study outcomes include psychosocial outcomes, patient preferences and cost-effectiveness.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Approximately 20% of Australian babies are delivered by emergency caesarean section. This will be the first Australian trial to examine ST analysis of the fetal electrocardiogram as an adjunct to cardiotocography as a potential method for reducing this proportion. The trial will be among the first to comprehensively examine ST analysis, taking into account the impact on psychosocial well-being as well as cost-effectiveness. This research will provide Australian evidence for clinical practice and guideline development as well as for policy-makers and consumers to make informed, evidence-based choices about care in labour.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par21">Use of cardiotocography (CTG) is almost ubiquitous in intrapartum care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In fact, continuous CTG is one of the most common procedures undertaken during labour, with routine data collection and other reports from Australia, the setting for STan Australian Randomised controlled Trial (START), showing that it is applied in 60–70% of all labours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While systematic reviews demonstrate benefit from such monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], important shortcomings exist, notably in relation to risk of increased rates of caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] which in turn can be accompanied by short-term and long-term risks to the mother and child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One-third of Australian women now deliver via caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with emergency caesarean section rates of between 18 and 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. While CTG is also associated with an increase in instrumental vaginal birth when compared with intermittent auscultation, it shows no improvement in overall perinatal death rates or cerebral palsy rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">A promising adjunct to CTG is electronic fetal monitoring which also incorporates ST analysis (STan) of the fetal electrocardiogram. This approach permits detection of metabolic acidosis of the fetus by identifying changes to the ST segment of the unborn baby’s ECG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] which are correlated with a simultaneously performed CTG, potentially reducing false positive diagnosis of fetal distress. With up to a 60% false positive diagnosis of fetal distress using CTG alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], there is considerable potential to reduce unnecessary operative delivery.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The main potential benefit for STan monitoring lies in the associated reduction in use of scalp pH sampling in low emergency caesarean section environments. While the most recent Cochrane meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found no significant reduction in caesarean section rate in low caesarean section environments, where arguably fewer unnecessary caesarean sections are performed, a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk of women having scalp pH samples was demonstrated. This finding has subsequently been supported in an individual patient data meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">This has crucial implications for Australian practice, as the indications for a decision for emergency caesarean section are the same as those for deciding to undertake scalp pH sampling. The specific relevance to our trial is that scalp pH testing is variably used in Australia, as its clinical utility has been seriously questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, it can be reasonably argued that if fetal blood sampling was indicated in a European context, a caesarean section would have been indicated in the Australian context.</p>
              <p id="Par25">There are additional factors which suggest that the European trials, as well as the recently published multicentre US study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] which also showed no reduction in caesarean section, have limited generalisability to Australian practice. Firstly, the four European trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] included in the Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which included women having STan for standard indications, had an overall emergency caesarean section rate of 10.6%, in contrast to the emergency caesarean section rate in Australia of approximately 18–20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given that Australia has a higher rate of potentially avoidable caesarean sections, this would enhance the degree to which a reduction in such unnecessary caesarean section is possible. Also, US fetal monitoring practice is fundamentally different to that in Australia. The US study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] included women at low risk for caesarean section who would not be offered CTG monitoring in Australia, and would have a low background risk of caesarean section regardless of monitoring type.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Further, delivery decisions for observed STan events were set at a lower threshold in the US study relative to the European guidelines and the clinical protocol that we report here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additionally, the use of STan in the US study did not result in fewer caesarean sections in an environment where the alternative to this intervention at full dilatation (i.e. instrumental vaginal delivery) is much less common. Instrumental vaginal delivery occurred in only about 6% of cases in the US study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], compared to 14% at the study hospital for the current trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">A ‘culture change’ may also be necessary for effective implementation of STan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A programme of continuing education and feedback, involving all of the labour-ward midwives and medical staff, is a strong feature of institutions where STan has been successfully implemented, such as in Norwegian clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While an education programme was implemented at the beginning of the US trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], STan monitoring was applied to an average of only 1.4 women per week in each of the study hospitals, providing exceptionally limited opportunities for development and maintenance of skills. This scenario is exacerbated in an organisational culture where changeover of doctors and midwives, and hence loss of trained STan expertise due to clinical rotations, would be common.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The most recent meta analyses at the time of this publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] showed that the use of STan is associated with no difference in the risk of caesarean section (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78–1.12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or operative vaginal deliveries for fetal distress (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.74–1.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] but did show a 36% reduction in metabolic acidosis (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46–0.88) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, the concurrence of a low background emergency caesarean section rate (in the European trials) and the use of fetal monitoring in a low-risk population (in the US trial), along with infrequent use and thus less experience and training of clinical staff, suggests that a reduction in caesarean section may be possible in an Australian setting. In fact, our pilot trial of 162 women indicated a 21.2% emergency caesarean section rate for the CTG group, and a 13.4% emergency caesarean section rate for the STan group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The proposed study presents the ideal opportunity to examine STan in an adequately powered randomised controlled trial, the first of its kind in Australia and the first comprehensive trial worldwide.</p>

                <title>Hypotheses</title>
                <p id="Par29">We believe that STan monitoring (cardiotocographic electronic fetal monitoring (CTG) plus analysis of the ST segment of the fetal electrocardiogram) of labouring women will result in a reduction in the proportion of emergency caesarean sections when compared with CTG monitoring alone, from 17% to 12%. The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of emergency caesarean sections for women on STan will not be equal to that for women on CTG monitoring alone. The study will be powered to detect an absolute difference of 5% with a conservative two-sided alternative. Our secondary hypotheses are that: there will be similarity in neonatal and maternal clinical outcomes in both treatment arms; STan monitoring will result in improved psychosocial outcomes; STan monitoring will be cost-effective compared to CTG alone; and STan monitoring will be preferred by women and they will be willing to trade-off the disadvantages, such as reduced mobility and the need for a fetal scalp electrode (FSE), in order to obtain advantages such as reduced chance of caesarean section.</p>

A total of 1818 women who have antepartum or intrapartum risk factors that increase the risk of fetal compromise for which continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour is recommended will be randomised for the study. Participants will be recruited at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital, a high-risk specialty facility with approximately 5000 deliveries per annum. Women are eligible for the trial if they meet the following inclusion criteria: 18 years or older; capable of informed consent; literate in English; and singleton fetus in cephalic presentation. Women will be excluded from participating if: they are less than 36 weeks gestation; they are planning a caesarean birth or require a caesarean due to placenta previa or vasa previa; they have contraindications for use of a fetal scalp electrode; they do not require continuous electronic fetal monitoring; they have participated in the study in a previous pregnancy; or there are known fetal structural or functional cardiac conditions.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par32">Considering the results of our pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], current hospital rates for emergency caesarean section and electronic fetal monitoring, and the results of previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we powered the primary hypothesis on a reduction of emergency caesarean section from 17% to 12%, (i.e. a 5% absolute difference), with 80% power and a conservative two-sided α = 0.05. To detect this absolute difference between the treatment groups, a total sample size of 1634 women is required. After allowing for a very conservative 10% dropout after consent and a further 22% attrition after consent due to no clinical indication for fetal monitoring in labour, and a possible further 5% non-compliance in the STan + CTG arm, consent would need to be gained from at least 2588 women. Given a recruitment period of about 2 years, we estimated that it would be possible to consent 2588 women, of whom 1818 will be subsequently randomised. This sample size would also provide power to detect clinically meaningful differences in the secondary outcomes of interest.</p>
                <p id="Par33">This is achievable at the study hospital. Of 5000 women per year birthing at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital, 12% have elective caesarean sections and do not labour, and approximately 8% are born pre-term, leaving 80% of women to labour at term (4000 women per year). Of these women, approximately 80% have electronic fetal monitoring (3200 women per year). The US study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported a consent and randomisation rate of 25.6%. Assuming a conservative consent and randomisation rate of only 20% of the over 9600 women thus eligible over a 3-year period, 1920 women would be consented and randomised. Given the 1818 consented and randomised women required in our sample size calculation, this sample size should be achievable.</p>

                  <p id="Par45">Women are invited to complete a psychosocial questionnaire which they will receive approximately 7 weeks after delivery, with the exception of women with severe adverse outcomes (e.g. fetal or neonatal death). The questionnaire has been constructed using several measures to examine satisfaction with continuous electronic fetal monitoring, birth satisfaction, general health, postnatal depression and infant feeding practices. These tools have robust psychometric properties and have been successfully applied in the maternity setting in past studies. The tools include the EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the General Health Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], a measure of infant feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the Birth Satisfaction Scale—Revised (BSS-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

A three-stage approach, previously successfully applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], will be followed: existing data from a qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] conducted during the pilot study will be used to determine the key factors (attributes) influencing preference; a preliminary questionnaire will be developed and piloted, providing data to inform an efficient experimental design for the main survey; and the final DCE questionnaire will be sent to women at approximately 16 weeks postnatal.</p>

Statistical analysis will follow standard methods for randomised trials and will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis, according to treatment allocation at randomisation. All analyses will follow a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. For dichotomous outcomes including the primary outcome of caesarean section (yes/no), proportions will be compared between treatment groups using the relative risk with 95% CI, obtained from a log binomial regression analysis with adjustment for strata (defined by parity) used in the randomisation. Further log binomial regression analyses (for sensitivity) will examine the effect of adjustment for parity, as well as pre-specified prognostic baseline variables and/or variables not balanced (by chance) at baseline, with results reported as the relative risk with corresponding 95% CIs. Categorical outcomes with more than two categories will be modelled with multinomial or ordinal logistic regression (or an appropriate generalised linear model alternative) with adjustment for parity. Proportions will be compared between treatment groups with relative risks and 95% CIs where possible. Continuous outcomes will be compared using differences between mean values estimated from linear or generalised linear regressions (depending on the nature of the data) adjusted for parity (with 95% CIs). Secondary analyses will explore evidence for heterogeneity of effects between the two parity strata using interaction tests and subgroup analyses. All subgroup comparisons will be pre-specified and performed with appropriate tests of interaction.

              <p id="Par55">About 20% of Australian babies are delivered via emergency caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. At 35% overall, Australian caesarean section rates continue to remain above the OECD average (34% in 2014) and are among the highest in the world, ranking 24th out of 31 OECD countries (rates ranked lowest to highest) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This will be the first Australian trial to examine the potential for STan technology to reduce this rate. It will also be among the first to consider a more comprehensive examination of STan, taking into account both the impact on broader psychosocial well-being and patient preference, as well as cost-effectiveness. Professional bodies such as the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology are currently relying on international evidence which our critique demonstrates is not generalisable to Australian practice.</p>
              <p id="Par56">In previous trials, very little attention has been paid to the views of women, midwives and obstetricians. This may partly explain the problems experienced with uptake in some settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In order to identify associated psychosocial and organisational issues, we have already conducted qualitative research with women throughout the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] as well as obtaining the views of midwives and obstetricians about the introduction of STan and the accompanying educational programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In-depth, semi-structured interviews incorporating hypothetical written scenarios of STan and CTG revealed that women’s views about monitoring are multifaceted and likely to be influenced by perceptions related to four key factors: risk in labour; mobility in labour; autonomy and choice in labour; and trust in maternity providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In contrast, doctors and midwives indicated four important areas for consideration when introducing STan: a philosophy of care; the implementation process (including training and education); the existence of research evidence; and attitudes towards new technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par57">This research will provide Australian evidence for clinical practice and guideline development which is crucial for policy-makers and consumers to make informed, evidence-based choices about care in labour. Given the ubiquitous application of CTG monitoring, we also anticipate that the trial will initiate and inform professional discussions about monitoring at an international level.</p>
