                  <p>The PORTEC-3 trial investigated the benefit of combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus pelvic radiotherapy alone for women with high-risk endometrial cancer. We updated the analysis to investigate patterns of recurrence and did a post-hoc survival analysis.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In the multicentre randomised phase 3 PORTEC-3 trial, women with high-risk endometrial cancer were eligible if they had International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage I, endometrioid grade 3 cancer with deep myometrial invasion or lymphovascular space invasion, or both; stage II or III disease; or stage IâIII disease with serous or clear cell histology; were aged 18 years and older; and had a WHO performance status of 0â2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive radiotherapy alone (48Â·6 Gy in 1Â·8 Gy fractions given on 5 days per week) or chemoradiotherapy (two cycles of cisplatin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given intravenously during radiotherapy, followed by four cycles of carboplatin AUC5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given intravenously), by use of a biased coin minimisation procedure with stratification for participating centre, lymphadenectomy, stage, and histological type. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and failure-free survival. Secondary endpoints of vaginal, pelvic, and distant recurrence were analysed according to the first site of recurrence. Survival endpoints were analysed by intention-to-treat, and adjusted for stratification factors. Competing risk methods were used for failure-free survival and recurrence. We did a post-hoc analysis to analyse patterns of recurrence with 1 additional year of follow-up. The study was closed on Dec 20, 2013; follow-up is ongoing.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Nov 23, 2006, and Dec 20, 2013, 686 women were enrolled, of whom 660 were eligible and evaluable (330 in the chemoradiotherapy group, and 330 in the radiotherapy-alone group). At a median follow-up of 72Â·6 months (IQR 59Â·9â85Â·6), 5-year overall survival was 81Â·4% (95% CI 77Â·2â85Â·8) with chemoradiotherapy versus 76Â·1% (71Â·6â80Â·9) with radiotherapy alone (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·70 [95% CI 0Â·51â0Â·97], p=0Â·034), and 5-year failure-free survival was 76Â·5% (95% CI 71Â·5â80Â·7) versus 69Â·1% (63Â·8â73Â·8; HR 0Â·70 [0Â·52â0Â·94], p=0Â·016). Distant metastases were the first site of recurrence in most patients with a relapse, occurring in 78 of 330 women (5-year probability 21Â·4%; 95% CI 17Â·3â26Â·3) in the chemoradiotherapy group versus 98 of 330 (5-year probability 29Â·1%; 24Â·4â34Â·3) in the radiotherapy-alone group (HR 0Â·74 [95% CI 0Â·55â0Â·99]; p=0Â·047). Isolated vaginal recurrence was the first site of recurrence in one patient (0Â·3%; 95% CI 0Â·0â2Â·1) in both groups (HR 0Â·99 [95% CI 0Â·06â15Â·90]; p=0Â·99), and isolated pelvic recurrence was the first site of recurrence in three women (0Â·9% [95% CI 0Â·3â2Â·8]) in the chemoradiotherapy group versus four (0Â·9% [95% CI 0Â·3â2Â·8]) in the radiotherapy-alone group (HR 0Â·75 [95% CI 0Â·17â3Â·33]; p=0Â·71). At 5 years, only one grade 4 adverse event (ileus or obstruction) was reported (in the chemoradiotherapy group). At 5 years, reported grade 3 adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups, occurring in 16 (8%) of 201 women in the chemoradiotherapy group versus ten (5%) of 187 in the radiotherapy-alone group (p=0Â·24). The most common grade 3 adverse event was hypertension (in four [2%] women in both groups). At 5 years, grade 2 or worse adverse events were reported in 76 (38%) of 201 women in the chemoradiotherapy group versus 43 (23%) of 187 in the radiotherapy-alone group (p=0Â·002). Sensory neuropathy persisted more often after chemoradiotherapy than after radiotherapy alone, with 5-year rates of grade 2 or worse neuropathy of 6% (13 of 201 women) versus 0% (0 of 187). No treatment-related deaths were reported.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>This updated analysis shows significantly improved overall survival and failure-free survival with chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. This treatment schedule should be discussed and recommended, especially for women with stage III or serous cancers, or both, as part of shared decision making between doctors and patients. Follow-up is ongoing to evaluate long-term survival.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed for clinical studies published in English between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2006, with the terms âendometrial cancerâ AND âradiation therapyâ AND âchemotherapyâ AND âsurvivalâ OR âfailure free survivalâ AND with the terms âendometrial cancerâ AND âserousâ AND âradiation therapyâ AND âchemotherapyâ AND âsurvivalâ OR âfailure free survivalâ. Six relevant publications were identified. Among these, three randomised trials compared adjuvant chemotherapy with radiotherapy. No differences in overall and progression-free survival were found, whereas an increased frequency of pelvic relapse was reported after chemotherapy alone. Therefore, after these results, the next step was to explore the combination of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since the start of recruitment to the PORTEC-3 trial in 2006, the results of a pooled analysis of the NSGO-EC-9501/EORTC-55991 trial and the ManGO ILIADE-III trial were published, showing a significant improvement in progression-free survival and non-significant improvement in overall survival in women treated with four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy given sequentially before or after pelvic radiotherapy versus those treated with radiotherapy alone. Results of two relevant trials (Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG]-GOG 249 and GOG-258) have been published recently. The GOG-249 trial did not show improved progression-free survival with three cycles of carboplatinâpaclitaxel with vaginal brachytherapy compared with pelvic radiotherapy in women with stage IâII disease with high (intermediate) risk factors. In the GOG-258 trial, women with stage IIIâIV endometrial cancer were randomly assigned to receive chemoradiotherapy (the same schedule as that used in the PORTEC-3 trial) or six cycles of carboplatinâpaclitaxel alone. No differences in overall or recurrence-free survival were reported, but significantly more vaginal and pelvic or para-aortic recurrences were reported in the chemotherapy group than in the chemoradiotherapy group. The added value of chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone for women with serous cancer has, to our knowledge, been reported in retrospective series only. In a large retrospective study done in 135 women with stage IâIVA serous endometrial cancer, recurrence-free survival was improved by the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses in randomised trials have not confirmed such benefits for serous cancers. The NSGO/EORTC trial reported improved progression-free survival with the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy for endometrioid cancers, but no such benefit was found for serous cancers.</p>

                  <p id="para70">We report on the patterns of recurrence and provide updated survival outcomes of patients with high-risk endometrial cancer treated in the international randomised phase 3 PORTEC-3 trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive pelvic radiotherapy alone or the combination of radiotherapy with concurrent (two cycles of cisplatin) and adjuvant (four cycles of carboplatinâpaclitaxel) chemotherapy. Both overall and failure-free survival were significantly improved in women treated with combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared with those treated with radiotherapy alone. In our post-hoc analysis of survival outcomes, the greatest absolute benefit was found for women with stage III or serous cancers, or both. In women with a recurrence, the majority had distant metastases. Pelvic control was excellent in both groups.</p>

              <p id="para100">The randomised phase 3 PORTEC-3 trial was initiated to investigate the benefit of a combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) schedule compared with external-beam radiotherapy alone for women with high-risk endometrial cancer. Previously reported efficacy results with a time-based analysis and a median follow-up of 60Â·2 months (IQR 48Â·1â73Â·1) showed a significant 7% improvement in failure-free survival for patients treated with chemoradiotherapy compared with those treated with radiotherapy alone (76% <italic>vs</italic> 69% at 5 years) without a significant difference in overall survival (82% <italic>vs</italic> 77% at 5 years).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In a subgroup analysis, the largest failure-free survival benefit with chemoradiotherapy (11%; 69% <italic>vs</italic> 58% at 5 years) was observed in women with stage III disease, who have a higher baseline risk of recurrence than women with stage IâII disease.</p>
              <p id="para110">The aim of the present analysis of the PORTEC-3 trial is to present the patterns of recurrence, treatment, and survival after recurrence and an updated (post-hoc) analysis of the primary endpoints with prolonged follow-up.</p>

                <p id="para120">PORTEC-3 was an open-label, multicentre, randomised intergroup phase 3 trial led by the Dutch Gynaecological Oncology Group (DGOG). The trial was done at 103 centres (oncology centres, university hospitals, regional hospitals, or radiation oncology centres with referrals from regional hospitals) in six clinical trial groups collaborating in the Gynaecological Cancer Intergroup. Participating groups were the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI; UK), the Australia and New Zealand Gynaecologic Oncology Group (ANZGOG; Australia and New Zealand), the Mario Negri Gynaecologic Oncology Group (MaNGO; Italy), the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (Canadian Cancer Trials Group; Canada), and Fedegyn (France).</p>

In brief, surgery consisted of total abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The extent of lymph node removal was left to the discretion of the participating centres, although pelvic lymph node debulking and para-aortic lymph node sampling were recommended in case of macroscopic positive pelvic nodes or para-aortic nodes, or both. Full surgical staging (including omentectomy, peritoneal biopsies, and lymph node sampling) was recommended for patients with serous or clear cell cancer. FIGO 2009 staging was assigned on the basis of surgical and pathological findings. Central pathology review was mandatory before randomisation to confirm eligibility for study entry.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para140">Eligible patients were women with histologically confirmed endometrioid endometrial cancer with either International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage IA grade 3 with documented lymphovascular space invasion; stage IB grade 3 disease; stage II disease; stage IIIA, IIIB (parametrial invasion), or IIIC disease; or stage IAâIII with serous or clear cell histology (IA with invasion). Eligibility criteria also included WHO performance score 0â2; adequate bone marrow function (white blood cell count â¥3Â·0âÃâ10<sup>9</sup> cells per L, platelets â¥100âÃâ10<sup>9</sup> per L), liver function (bilirubin â¤1Â·5âÃâupper limit of normal, aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio â¤2Â·5âÃâupper limit of normal) and kidney function (creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min calculated according to Cockroft and Gault or &gt;50 mL/min edetic acid [EDTA] clearance), and age 18 years or older (without an upper age limit, because elderly women might benefit from the study treatment if they were deemed fit enough to undergo chemotherapy). Exclusion criteria were uterine sarcoma or carcinosarcoma, previous malignancy (except for non-melanomatous skin cancer) within the past 10 years, previous pelvic radiotherapy, previous hormonal therapy or chemotherapy, bulky cervical involvement with radical hysterectomy, inflammatory bowel disease, residual macroscopic tumour, impaired renal or cardiac function, neuropathy grade 2 or worse, hearing impairment grade 3 or worse, or a congenital hearing disorder.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para170">External-beam pelvic radiotherapy was given to patients in both treatment groups to a total dose of 48Â·6 Gy in 1Â·8 Gy fractions, 5 days per week. Specifications of the treatment schedule have been reported previously.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In case of glandular or stromal cervical involvement, or both, a brachytherapy boost was given. Brachytherapy dose was equivalent to 14 Gy in 2 Gy fractions (with a recommended scheme of 10 Gy high-dose rate in fractions of 5 Gy). Treatment was recommended to start within 4â6 weeks of surgery, but no later than 8 weeks after surgery. Overall radiotherapy treatment time was not to exceed 50 days.</p>
                <p id="para180">In the chemoradiotherapy group, women received two cycles of cisplatin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administered intravenously in the first and fourth week of external-beam radiotherapy, followed by four cycles of carboplatin AUC5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administered intravenously at 21-day intervals. This schedule was based on the RTOG-9708 trial,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> with substitution of cisplatin by carboplatin in the adjuvant phase. Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 3 weeks after completion of external-beam pelvic radiotherapy, and with a 28-day interval from the second concurrent cycle. Cisplatin was postponed for 1 week in the event of haematological, renal, or other toxicities or discontinued if recovery required more than 1 week or in the case of grade 2 or worse neuropathy. Carboplatin was postponed or stopped in case of severe haematological toxicity. Paclitaxel was postponed if grade 2 neuropathy developed and stopped if recovery exceeded 1 week or if grade 3 neuropathy developed. Details about chemotherapy stopping rules have been described previously.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para190">Follow-up was focused on patient history and pelvic examination to detect adverse events (grade â¥2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 3.0) and symptoms of recurrent disease, with annual chest radiographs, blood counts, and chemistry tests (including CA-125) until 5 years after randomisation. Long-term follow-up of vital status and events was required at 7 years and 10 years. Health-related quality-of-life assessments were done at baseline, at the end of radiotherapy, at 6-month intervals from randomisation until 24 months, and at 36 and 60 months.</p>
                <p id="para200">Patients who immediately withdrew informed consent after randomisation without any information were excluded from the analysis, as were patients who were ineligible for the study. There were no other criteria for a patient to be removed from the study.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para210">The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and failure-free survival. Overall survival was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Failure-free survival was defined as the time from randomisation to any relapse, or death related to endometrial cancer or treatment, whichever occurred first. Women who were alive were censored at the date of their last follow-up. Secondary endpoints were vaginal, pelvic, or distant recurrence; treatment-related toxicity; and health-related quality of life.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Recurrences were analysed according to first site of recurrence as well as the total number of recurrences. Simultaneous vaginal and pelvic recurrence was considered pelvic recurrence; and simultaneous vaginal, pelvic, and distant recurrence was considered distant recurrence. Abdominal recurrences outside the pelvic area (peritoneal carcinomatosis, liver, and para-aortic lymph nodal metastases) were considered distant metastases, with specification of site. After diagnosis of any relapse, treatment information was required and follow-up continued according to protocol guidelines. An extensive update on quality of life will be reported separately in a future publication.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para220">The PORTEC-3 trial was powered (80%) to detect a 10% difference in 5-year overall survival between the treatment groups (increase from 65% to 75%; hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·67), with a two-sided test at an Î± level of 0Â·05. 198 overall survival events were required, with a minimum of 655 patients. A prespecified interim analysis was done in September, 2013, after 48 overall survival events (a third of the required events) had occurred. The final analysis of the co-primary endpoints was published in February, 2018, with permission of the data and safety monitoring board as a time-based analysis rather than an event-based analysis since a median follow-up of 60Â·2 months had been reached and because the event rate was lower than expected.</p>
                <p id="para230">To maintain an overall Î± of 0Â·05 with a nominal Î± level for the interim analysis of 0Â·0002, the final analysis was done with a nominal Î± of 0Â·0498. The final time-based analysis was done with a correlation of 0Â·7859 between the test statistics of the co-primary endpoints overall survival and failure-free survival (based on 136 overall survival events and 186 failure-free survival events), and a nominal Î± of 0Â·0309 was used for each of the analyses, resulting in an overall Î± level of 0Â·0498.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The sequential rejection principle<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> implies that if the null hypothesis of no treatment difference for one of the co-primary endpoints is rejected (p&lt;0Â·0309), the null hypothesis of no treatment difference for the other co-primary endpoint can then be assessed at the 0Â·05 level, while still retaining a family-wise error rate of 0Â·05.</p>
                <p id="para240">The current analysis was done to evaluate patterns of recurrences, together with a non-prespecified post-hoc analysis of survival after recurrence as well as an updated analysis of overall survival and failure-free survival with prolonged follow-up and 5-year adverse events. Final database lock was on Nov 29, 2018.</p>
                <p id="para250">We did statistical analyses using SPSS, version 23.0.0.2, and R, version 3.5.1. All analyses were done by intention to treat, excluding ineligible patients and those who immediately withdrew informed consent after randomisation. Differences in relapse and survival rates between the groups were tested with the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. The analysis of the primary endpoints was adjusted for the stratification factors (participating group, lymphadenectomy, stage of cancer, and histological type), since a stratified minimisation procedure was used at randomisation.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> For the adjusted analysis, stratification factors were included as covariates in the Cox model.

For the first failure analysis of recurrences, all other recurrences and death were used as competing risks. Median survival after recurrence was calculated as the first timepoint at which the Kaplan-Meier curve was below 50% survival. The IQR was calculated similarly. In the multivariable analysis, the following covariates were included together with treatment: stage, histological type and grade, type of surgery, participating groups, lymphovascular space invasion, and age. The median follow-up and IQR was estimated with the reverse Kaplan-Meier method.</p>

This number of events comprised 76% (150 of 198) of required overall survival events and 95% (189 of 198) of failure-free survival events for the final analysis. Most deaths were related to endometrial cancer: 53 (82%) of 65 in the chemoradiotherapy group versus 76 (89%) of 85 in the radiotherapy group. Among women assigned to chemoradiotherapy, other causes of death were second cancers (in five [8%] patients), other intercurrent disease (in three [5%] patients), and complications of treatment for metastatic disease (in two [3%] patients). Among women assigned to radiotherapy alone, other causes of death were second cancers (in five [6%] patients), other intercurrent disease (in one [1%] patient), and complications of treatment for metastatic disease (in one [1%] patient). The cause of death was uncertain for two patients treated with chemoradiotherapy and two patients treated with radiotherapy alone; these deaths were considered failure-free survival events since a relation to endometrial cancer or to treatment for endometrial cancer could not be excluded.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para430">These updated results of the PORTEC-3 trial, with a longer median follow-up of 72 months and with 75% of participants having reached 5 years of follow-up, showed a significant improvement in both overall and failure-free survival with chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for high-risk endometrial cancer. The absolute improvement at 5 years was 5% (HR 0Â·70; 95% CI 0Â·51â0Â·97) for overall survival and 7% (0Â·70; 0Â·52â0Â·94) for failure-free survival. Most recurrences were at distant sites, with excellent local and regional control in both groups. Women in the radiotherapy group were more likely to receive chemotherapy for their first recurrence. Women with serous cancers had worse overall survival and failure-free survival than those with other histological types, and for these women a significant improvement of overall survival (absolute improvement 19%; HR 0Â·48 [95% CI 0Â·24â0Â·96]) and failure-free survival (absolute improvement 12%; 0Â·42 [0Â·22â0Â·80]) was found with chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone.</p>
              <p id="para440">External-beam radiotherapy has been the standard adjuvant treatment for women with high-risk endometrial cancer for several decades. Since trials comparing adjuvant chemotherapy alone with external-beam radiotherapy alone did not show differences in survival,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> the combination of external-beam radiotherapy with four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy was investigated in the randomised NSGO-EC-9501/EORTC-55991 trial.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> A pooled analysis with the ManGO ILIADE-III trial showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival at 5 years with chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone (78% <italic>vs</italic> 69%, p=0Â·01) and a non-significant improvement in 5-year overall survival (82% <italic>vs</italic> 75%; p=0Â·07).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The RTOG 9708 phase 2 trial investigated combined external-beam radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, with both treatment modalities started early after surgery. This combination showed manageable toxicity and a 5-year overall survival of 85% and relapse-free survival of 79%. The PORTEC-3 trial confirmed these high survival rates in a large randomised trial, with estimated 5-year overall survival of 79% and 5-year failure-free survival of 73% in the chemoradiotherapy group.</p>
              <p id="para450">High-risk endometrial cancer comprises a heterogeneous group of tumours with both early-stage disease with high-risk features and advanced stage endometrial cancer and non-endometrioid tumours. When analysing results by stage, women with stage III endometrial cancer had a significantly higher risk of recurrence than did those with stage IâII disease. For women with stage IâII endometrial cancer, combined adjuvant treatment yielded only a small absolute improvement of 2% (HR 0Â·84; 95% CI 0Â·52â1Â·38) in 5-year overall survival and of 4% (0Â·87; 0Â·56â1Â·36) in failure-free survival. These results are supported by the results of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-249 trial, in which women with stage IâII endometrial cancer were randomly assigned to receive external-beam radiotherapy or vaginal brachytherapy and three cycles of carboplatinâpaclitaxel chemotherapy. No differences in overall survival or recurrence-free survival were reported, but pelvic and para-aortic recurrences were significantly more frequent after vaginal brachytherapy and chemotherapy.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Taking the results of the GOG-249 and PORTEC-3 trials together, a minimal benefit in failure-free survival and overall survival in stage IâII endometrial cancer achieved with chemoradiotherapy does not seem to justify the increased frequency of adverse events, impaired quality of life, and longer treatment duration of combined treatment for these patients.</p>
              <p id="para460">For women with stage III endometrial cancer in PORTEC-3, a significant improvement in overall survival (HR 0Â·63) and in failure-free survival (HR 0Â·61) was found with chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. In the GOG-258 trial, 813 women with stage IIIâIVA endometrial cancer were randomly assigned to receive pelvic external-beam radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy (with the same schedule as that of the PORTEC-3 trial), or to receive chemotherapy alone (six cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel).<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Although no differences in recurrence-free and overall survival were found, significantly more vaginal recurrences (HR 0Â·36) and pelvic or para-aortic, or both, recurrences (HR 0Â·43) were seen in women treated with chemotherapy alone. While using the same chemoradiotherapy schedule as in PORTEC-3, recurrence-free survival in GOG-258 was 59% (97% stage III) compared with 71% in PORTEC-3 for stage III disease. In retrospective cohorts, a high frequency of locoregional recurrence was also found after treatment with chemotherapy alone,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> supporting the continued use of pelvic radiotherapy in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Taking the findings of these two recent large trials together, the addition of chemotherapy should be discussed and recommended for women with stage III endometrial cancer to improve failure-free and overall survival as part of shared decision making between doctors and their patients.</p>
              <p id="para470">Overall and failure-free survival for women with serous cancers were lower than for those with endometrioid and clear cell cancers, and the difference in overall survival and failure-free survival among the different disease stages was more pronounced for women with serous cancers than for those with other histologies. Retrospective studies have reported improvements in overall survival and recurrence-free survival with chemotherapy for serous cancers.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In several randomised trials, however, subgroup analyses for treatment effect in different histological types did not confirm such benefits.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In a GOG study of four randomised chemotherapy trials in women with metastatic and recurrent endometrial cancer, comprising 1203 patients, no association was found between response and histological type.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> In the PORTEC-3 trial, however, a significant improvement in both overall survival and failure-free survival was found for women with serous cancers treated with chemoradiotherapy. However, such subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution for several reasons. The number of patients with serous cancer in these trials is relatively small, and serous cancers have often been grouped together with clear cell cancers. In the current PORTEC-3 analysis, we found that the frequency of recurrence among women with clear cell cancers was similar to that of women with endometrioid tumours and clearly lower than that of women with serous cancers. Another factor to consider when interpreting subgroup analyses is the use of different chemotherapy regimens among the different trials. In the NSGO/EORTC trial,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> the GOG-122 trial,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and the GOG metastatic endometrial cancer analysis,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> cisplatin-based combinations were used, whereas in the PORTEC-3, GOG-249, and GOG-258 trials, carboplatin and paclitaxel were given.</p>
              <p id="para480">In the PORTEC-3 trial, 105 patients with serous cancers were included. PORTEC-3 is the first randomised trial to show a significant improvement in overall survival and failure-free survival with combined adjuvant treatment for women with serous cancers, but in absolute terms mostly for higher stage disease. The number of women and events are too low to report on treatment efficacy across the different stages of serous cancers. To achieve further improvements in survival outcomes for women with serous cancers, targeted therapies based on molecular alterations should be explored. Serous cancers are characterised by a high frequency of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, and in approximately 25% of patients an overexpression of HER2/neu has been reported, with a potential progression-free survival benefit by addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>
              <p id="para490">Most first recurrences in the PORTEC-3 trial were at distant sites, with only few simultaneous vaginal or pelvic recurrences. Isolated vaginal or pelvic recurrence was rare. This finding is in line with other randomised trials that used radiotherapy in both groups.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In the PORTEC-3 schedule, which was based on the RTOG-9708 phase 2 trial,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> both treatment modalities were started early after surgery, aiming at achieving rapid efficacy of both treatment modalities and potential increase of the effect of radiotherapy by the two concurrent cycles. This schedule has now been proven safe and effective in two large, randomised trials with toxicity and quality-of-life data, whereas no phase 3 evidence is available for the specific benefit for other sequences of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Widespread differences exist in the practice of giving chemotherapy and radiotherapy in either sequence or in a so-called sandwich schedule; concurrent start of both modalities might be most effective and efficient. Since most first recurrences were at distant sites (although with fewer in the combined treatment group than in the radiotherapy-only group), one could speculate whether multi-agent chemotherapy should already be given concurrently. However, no evidence exists for other concurrent schedules in endometrial cancer, whereas, for example, weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel has been shown to be effective in patients with oesophageal cancer.</p>
              <p id="para500">In a patient preference study done by the ANZGOG group among their PORTEC-3 participants,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> more than 50% of women reported a 5% survival improvement or an extra 1 year survival as being sufficient to make chemotherapy worthwhile. Although both co-primary endpoints showed a significant improvement and are within this range, weighing the benefits of chemoradiotherapy against the increased risk of adverse events remains important. Significantly more severe adverse events and reduced health-related quality of life were reported in the combined treatment group during the first year after treatment.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, rapid recovery was seen, with no significant differences in grade 3â4 adverse events from 12 months onwards. At 60 months after randomisation, significantly more patients reported grade 2 toxicity with the combination treatment, of which sensory neuropathy is the most significant (6% <italic>vs</italic> 0%) and clinically relevant.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p id="para510">A limitation of this analysis is that the subgroup analyses were not powered and the survival update was a non-prespecified, post-hoc analysis, with an additional follow-up time of 12 months after 95% of the required failure-free survival events had occurred. However, the previous (time-based) analysis already showed a significant improvement in failure-free survival, and the overall survival difference was close to significance. The differences in overall and failure-free survival have remained and have even become stronger with a longer follow-up time and more events recorded.</p>
              <p id="para520">In terms of the statistical significance of our findings, the p value for failure-free survival was 0Â·016 and that for overall survival was 0Â·034, whereas the boundary for claiming positivity of the study based on Pocock correction was 0Â·031 (ie, if either or both of the p values were lower than 0Â·031 the study is deemed positive). The sequential rejection principle<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> implies that, since the null hypothesis of no treatment difference for failure-free survival was rejected (p&lt;0Â·031), the null hypothesis of no treatment difference for the co-primary endpoint of overall survival can then be assessed at the 0Â·05 level, while still retaining a family-wise error rate of 0Â·05. Application of this principle implies that the treatment effect for overall survival can be considered significant.</p>
              <p id="para530">Better selection of women for adjuvant treatment might be achieved by integration of molecular characteristics. For intermediate-risk endometrial cancer, an improved risk assessment was reported with an integrated profile of clinicopathological and molecular risk factors.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This approach is currently being tested in the randomised PORTEC-4a trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03469674" id="interrefs60">NCT03469674</ext-link>). A pilot study of the TransPORTEC consortium showed that determination of the molecular subgroups as described by the Cancer Genome Atlas Group<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> also improved risk assessment in high-risk endometrial cancer. Translational research is being done on tumour tissue samples donated by PORTEC-3 participants as part of an international collaboration. The molecular subgroups and additional molecular characteristics will be ascertained and the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in relation to these factors will be explored.</p>
              <p id="para540">In conclusion, this updated analysis of the PORTEC-3 trial shows improved 5-year overall and failure-free survival with chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone for women with high-risk endometrial cancer, with the greatest absolute benefit for chemotherapy seen in women with stage III disease or serous cancers, or both. Most recurrences were at distant sites, suggesting that new systemic treatment approaches are needed to improve survival outcomes. Molecular analysis has the potential to improve risk stratification and should be used to identify subgroups that can derive the greatest benefit from chemotherapy and to select patients for targeted therapies; molecular studies on tissue samples donated by PORTEC-3 trial participants are ongoing.</p>

                <p>The PORTEC-3 study was supported by a grant from the <funding-source id="GS1">Dutch Cancer Society</funding-source> (UL2006-4168/CKTO 2006-04), the Netherlands. PORTEC 3 was supported in the UK by <funding-source id="GS2">Cancer Research UK</funding-source> (C7925/A8659). Participation in the PORTEC-3 trial by the Australia and New Zealand Gynaecologic Oncology Group (ANZGOG) and the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) were supported by the <funding-source id="GS3">NHMRC</funding-source> Project Grant 570894 (2008) and by a Cancer Australia Grant (awarded through the 2011 round of the priority-driven Collaborative Cancer Research Scheme and funded by Cancer Australia). Participation by the Italian MaNGO group was partly supported by a grant from the <funding-source id="GS5">Italian Medicines Agency</funding-source> AIFA (FARM84BCX2). Canadian participation in the PORTEC-3 trial was supported by the <funding-source id="GS6">Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute</funding-source> (grants #015469 and #021039). We thank all the participating groups: DGOG (the Netherlands), NCRI (UK), ANZGOG (Australia and New Zealand), MaNGO (Italy), Fedegyn (France), and the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (Canada); their coordinating teams, principal investigators, staff, and clinical research teams at the group's participating centres for all their work and efforts, and the women who participated in the trial. The PORTEC-3 trial involved a strong international collaboration within the Gynaecological Oncology InterGroup (GCIG) and the support of the GCIG officers and member groups is gratefully acknowledged. We also thank the members of the data safety monitoring board for their invaluable work and guidance throughout the duration of the trial. This analysis was presented in part at the Annual Meeting of the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, April 20â24, 2018, Barcelona, Spain.</p>
