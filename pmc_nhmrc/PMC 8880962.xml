                  <p id="P5">Understanding the nature of transitions from a healthy state to
chronic diseases and death is important for planning health-care system

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="P6">We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the ASPREE trial,
which was done in 50 sites in Australia and the USA and recruited
community-dwelling, healthy individuals who were aged 70 years or older
(≥65 years for Black and Hispanic people in the USA) between March
10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014. Participants were followed up with annual
face-to-face visits, biennial assessments of cognitive function, and
biannual visits for physical function until death or June 12, 2017,
whichever occurred first. We used multistate models to examine transitions
from a healthy state to first intermediate disease events (ie, cancer
events, stroke events, cardiac events, and physical disability or dementia)
and, ultimately, to death. We also examined the effects of age and sex on
transition rates using Cox proportional hazards regression models.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p id="P7">19 114 participants with a median age of 74·0 years (IQR
71·6–77·7) were included in our analyses. During a
median follow-up of 4·7 years (IQR 3·6–5·7),
1933 (10·1%) of 19 114 participants had an incident cancer event, 487
(2·5%) had an incident cardiac event, 398 (2·1%) had an
incident stroke event, 924 (4·8%) developed persistent physical
disability or dementia, and 1052 (5·5%) died. 15 398 (80·6%)
individuals did not have any of these events during follow-up. The highest
proportion of deaths followed incident cancer (501 [47·6%] of 1052)
and 129 (12·3%) participants transitioned from disability or dementia
to death. Among 12 postulated transitions, transitions from the intermediate
states to death had much higher rates than transitions from a healthy state
to death. The progression rates to death were 158 events per 1000
person-years (95% CI 144–172) from cancer, 112 events per 1000
person-years (86–145) from stroke, 88 events per 1000 person-years
(68–111) from cardiac disease, 69 events per 1000 person-years
(58–82) from disability or dementia, and four events per 1000
person-years (4–5) from a healthy state. Age was significantly
associated with an accelerated rate for most transitions. Male sex
(<italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> female sex) was significantly associated with an
accelerate rate for five of 12 transitions.</p>

the most common transition was from a healthy state to cancer. Our findings

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P9">Mortality in middle-aged adults (eg, 45–65 years) has fallen sharply
over the past 50 years in most high-income countries. This decrease has been driven
primarily by a continuous decline in deaths from cardiovascular disease in this age
group.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> More than 80% of
adults in these countries now survive beyond 70 years, often in relatively good
health.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> However, with
progression into the eighth and ninth decades of life, there are increasing rates of
transition from good health to chronic disease and then to death, often with an
intervening period of physical disability, cognitive disability, or both.</p>
              <p id="P10">Although population ageing is occurring across most high-income countries,
and increasingly also in low-income and middle-income countries, there is sparse
knowledge about the health trajectories of older age groups. Rates of transition
from one state to another are known to vary according to risk factors, such as age,
sex, and social circumstances.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Understanding
the nature and rate of these transitions is important for planning health-care
system requirements and interventions. Examples of disease transition modelling have
been previously reported but have typically focused on discrete conditions, such as
cardiovascular disease or cancer.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, with
advancing age, health increasingly involves the development of chronic illnesses,
which are associated with varying risks of disability and mortality, underscoring
the need to identify the broader determinants of heath impairment.</p>

ASPREE was a randomised controlled trial, which recruited community-dwelling,

were rigorously followed up with systematic ascertainment of the common diseases of

randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial comparing the
effect of 100 mg/day of oral aspirin versus placebo on the primary endpoint of
disability-free survival. Between March 10, 2010, and Dec 24, 2014, the trial
recruited 19 114 community-dwelling, initially healthy individuals without a
previous history of cardiovascular events, dementia, or major physical
disabilities who were aged 70 years or older (≥65 years for Black and
Hispanic individuals in the USA) from 16 sites in Australia and 34 sites in the
USA; the rationale for the lower age cutoff for minority ethnic individuals was
based on the fact that, in the USA, they have a lower life expectancy than White
people. At study entry, participants were required to be well functioning,
defined as being cognitively unimpaired and able to perform the Katz activities
of daily living with minimal difficulty.</p>

fibrillation, uncontrolled blood pressure (≥180/105 mmHg), a history of
dementia (or a Modified Mini-Mental State Examination score of ≤77), or
major difficulty or inability to perform any one of the six basic Katz
activities of daily living. Although potential participants were not routinely
excluded if they had a personal history of cancer, those with any serious
illness with a life expectancy of less than 5 years (based on the judgement of
their physician) or those with known active cancer were excluded; the 5-year
timeframe was selected because it represented the duration of intervention.</p>

different health states: cardiac events (eg, myocardial infarction and
hospitalisation for heart failure); stroke events (eg, haemorrhagic stroke,
ischaemic stroke, ischaemic stroke with haemorrhagic transformation,
sub-arachnoid haemorrhagic stroke, and stroke with undetermined origin); cancer
events (any incident cancer diagnosis except non-melanoma skin cancer);
persistent physical disability or dementia; and death. All these events were
adjudicated by expert committees masked to treatment allocation and following
standardised procedures. These events were selected because cancer, cardiac
disease, dementia, and cerebrovascular disease are the major causes of
disability-adjusted life-years lost among people older than 70 years and in the
Australian population,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> from

transitions to capture possible major health conditions of a participant over
time (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Specifically, all
participants began in the initial healthy state at baseline, which was defined
as the timepoint of study entry. When a first event occurred, participants could
move from their current state to one of the intermediate states (ie, incident
cancer, incident cardiac disease, incident stroke, or physical disability or
dementia) or to death as the final absorbing state. Importantly, due to the
small number of events and to keep the model graspable, we did not consider all
possible transitions between intermediate states. As previous cancer diagnoses
might have impacted our findings, we also did post-hoc sensitivity analyses
excluding participants with a history of cancer at study entry.</p>
                <p id="P20">To quantify the effect of baseline risk factors (ie, age and sex) on
transition rates, we used Cox proportional hazards regression for each
transition separately. We assumed that each transition was associated with a
separate baseline hazard and that covariate effects differed for each
transition. In all models, a clock-forward approach was used in which each
transition was modelled by use of a single time scale: time since entering the
initial state.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Due to the

years, and female and aged 85 years. These two age values were chosen because
75·0 years (SD 4·5) was the mean age of the cohort, and 85 years
was additionally included to illustrate the effect of ageing. All analyses were
done by use of R (version 4.0) and the mstate package for the multistate

time of 4·7 years (IQR 3·6–5·7), 1933 (10·1%)
participants had an incident cancer event, 487 (2·5%) had an incident cardiac
event, and 398 (2·1%) had an incident stroke event (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Furthermore, 924 (4·8%) participants
developed persistent physical disability or dementia and 1052 (5·5%) died

transitioned to cancer, 425 (2·2%) transitioned to cardiac events, 328

captured 96% of all observed cancer events, 88% of cardiac events, 82% of stroke

analysis in which we excluded participants with a history of cancer (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 3</xref>). Because participants can
develop events in a different order to that in the multistate model we developed,
the number of events captured by our model is not necessarily 100%.</p>

(cancer, cardiac disease, stroke, or physical disability or dementia) to death had

158 events per 1000 person-years (95% CI 144–172) from cancer, 112 events per

strongly associated with all transitions, except for stroke to disability or

to death from a healthy state (hazard ratio [HR] 1·99, 95% CI
1·80–2·20; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 7</xref>). A 5-year increase in age also increased the risk of
developing disability or dementia among participants with cardiac diseases (HR
1·97, 95% CI 1·39–2·79) and the risk of dying after a
stroke (HR 1·88, 1·52–2·34). Compared with men, women
were half as likely to develop incident cardiac disease, transition from previous
cancer to disability or dementia, and transition from previous disability or
dementia to death (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P30">In this Article, we describe the transition rates from a healthy, well
functioning state to intermediate disease states or death during a median of
4·7 years of follow-up among participants recruited to the ASPREE trial. The
development of persistent physical disability or dementia were prespecified outcomes
of the ASPREE trial, which together were regarded as a surrogate for a loss of
independence.</p>
              <p id="P31">In our analyses, we report four salient findings. First, most individuals
(80·6%) remained in a healthy state during follow-up, reflecting the
relatively healthy status of the participants entering the study. Second, cancer
dominated as the most common reason for leaving the healthy state, with a rate of
incident cancer per 1000 person-years more than double that of cardiac disease,
stroke, disability or dementia, or death. In previous analyses using data from the
ASPREE trial, prostate, colorectal, and breast cancers were the most common incident
cancers.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We found that
transition to death after a diagnosis of cancer was also substantially higher than
after a diagnosis of incident stroke, cardiac disease, or disability or dementia.
However, the strict screening procedures at baseline (eg, excluding people with a
history of cardiovascular events) probably led to a lower-than-expected rate of
cardiovascular events. Third, only 105 (11·4%) of 924 participants who
developed persistent physical disability or dementia did so following the
intermediate health states of stroke, cardiac disease, or cancer. Not surprisingly,
the transition rate to disability or dementia was substantially greater after stroke
than after cardiac disease or cancer.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Finally,
increasing age was strongly associated with increased risk for almost all
transitions. Transition rates across states remained proportionally similar among
participants aged 75 years or older and among those younger than 75 years, but
absolute rates were higher among participants 75 years or older than among
participants younger than 75 years. Furthermore, most transitions occurred at a
substantially lower rate in women than in men.</p>
              <p id="P32">The application of this modelling approach was possible because of the
detailed outcome data (eg, on cancer) collected in the contemporary ASPREE trial.
This dataset provided the opportunity to observe a large population of relatively
healthy participants screened for the presence of previous cardiac disease events,
cognitive impairment, and other potentially life-limiting conditions. Most
importantly, in accordance with trial procedures, participants were continuously
followed up until death or the end of follow-up, regardless of intervening events,
making the dataset valuable for multistate modelling.</p>
              <p id="P33">Our analyses have important implications. Most individuals remained in a
healthy state, albeit during a moderate timeframe of approximately 5 years. The
average life remaining for people aged 65 years is 18·2 years for men and
20·8 years for women in the USA and 20·0 years for men and 22·7
years for women in Australia.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>
These projections include those who already have chronic disease and those who are
healthy, underscoring the possible gains from effective prevention. Prevention might
be at an individual level through engagement with health-care professionals or at a
population-wide level to diminish the impact of risk factors that are often shared
between different diseases and that might be targeted by common evidence-based
interventions. One specific aspect of disease prevention is targeted cancer
screening in older people. Cancer screening is somewhat controversial, and the
relatively high incidence of cancer observed in our analyses highlights the
importance of this debate.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P34">Our findings are also relevant for health economics and planning.
Approximately 1·3 million individuals are currently in residential care in
the USA, most of whom have a physical or mental disability.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Delaying the onset of chronic disease offers
the greatest economic benefit, both within and outside of health systems
(cross-health system benefit).<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>
In 2020, the Decade of Healthy Ageing collaboration was introduced by WHO to
stimulate improvements in the lives of older individuals.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> An improved understanding of ageing and the
prevention of transition from an initially healthy state to chronic disease, loss of
independence, and death is becoming increasingly important for those formulating
health policy and strategies.</p>
              <p id="P35">Many countries are facing rapidly ageing populations with reduced
independence due to acute and chronic diseases, leading to increased demand for
health services and high costs for treatment and residential care.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Epidemiological modelling based on
accurate information regarding time spent in various health states will assist in
prioritising preventive interventions and guiding resource allocation. Such
modelling could, for example, be used to estimate the required resources for
residential care if local public health data with sufficient detail were available.
In the future, more detailed modelling could also consider a broader range of
illnesses and health states and account for other changes (eg, in secular disease
patterns and the ethnic mix of a population). Ultimately, approaches to improve the
lives of older people, particularly those geared towards prevention, will be most
effective if a longer-term perspective is applied.</p>
              <p id="P36">Several previous observational studies have used multistate models to
estimate the risk of recurrent events in patients with chronic conditions, such as
cancer, diabetes, or heart failure.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> For example, the Leiden 85-plus
study<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> investigated the
risk of transitions between different states of disability in 597 older Dutch
individuals (aged ≥85 years) and found depression, chronic diseases, and
cognitive impairment to be the most relevant predictors of deterioration of specific
health conditions. The Newcastle 85+ study<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> reported sex-specific differences in predictors for
disability and death and the Vitality 90+ study<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> evaluated predictors for disability and multimorbidity in
older individuals (aged ≥90 years). In the Whitehall II study,<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> the investigators used multistate
modelling to assess risk factors for different cardiovascular diseases states.
However, none of these studies had detailed access to information about
participants’ transitions from health, to chronic illness, to disability or
dementia, and to death. This information was available in a study of 754
community-dwelling participants aged 70 years or older in the USA, from which the
investigators developed a multistate model to evaluate different states of
disability and the transition to death.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The authors reported a high frequency of transitions
between states and highlighted the relevance of frailty. However, no data on
intermediate health states were collected. By contrast to these previous studies,
the ASPREE trial provides several unique aspects that makes it highly suitable for
multistate analyses. For instance, at study entry, all participants were screened to
confirm their healthy status. Furthermore, the trial protocol ensured a continuous
follow-up and the collection of multiple, adjudicated outcome events and measures of
cognitive function.</p>
              <p id="P37">Our study has some limitations. First, our analyses were based on a dataset
with strict trial inclusion criteria and a healthy volunteer bias. Thus, our results
are not fully representative of a typical population of older individuals, a
substantial proportion of which is usually already affected by chronic disease,
disability, or dementia. However, our results are likely to reflect the later life
course of the substantial proportion of individuals who enter older age in a
relatively healthy state, free of overt cardiovascular disease, physical disability,
or considerable cognitive impairment. Such representation is important because the
incidence of cardiovascular disease has substantially decreased with time in
high-income countries.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Second,
we developed a simplified model that did not include all possible interstate
transitions, reverse transitions, or cause-specific mortality. However, our decision
to simplify the model was based on the fact that transition models with additional
states can become very complex and difficult to interpret, partly because of the
smaller numbers that arise when stratifying events by a larger number of states. We
also included both acute and chronic health conditions, and combined physical
disability and dementia. Although these simplifications might not be appropriate in
predictive modelling or clinical decision making, we aimed instead to describe an
overview of trajectories leading to the end of independent living. We also did not
include other potential factors in our analyses, such as social determinants,
multimorbidity, or ethnicity, which might have affected transitions. Third, we
acknowledge that 19·2% of ASPREE participants had a history of cancer, which
could have influenced the incidence of cancer during follow-up. However, at
baseline, all participants were required to have an estimated life expectancy of at
least 5 years and only 113 (5·8%) of 1933 incident cancer diagnoses were a
recurrence of a cancer diagnosed before entry to ASPREE.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Finally, our results were derived from
populations in two high-income countries with high health-care standards. Australia
also has a universal health-care system for people aged 75 years or older, whereas
the Medicare programme in the USA (a federal agency that administers health-care
services) varies in its health-care coverage.</p>
              <p id="P38">In conclusion, we have described transitions to intermediate health states
and to death in an initially healthy, older population. These findings have
potential implications for preventive cancer screening and planning for residential
care in healthier ageing populations. The application of a multistate model provides
unique insights into the frequency of events, their transition rates, and the impact
of age and sex.</p>

                <p id="P59">Because life expectancy is progressively increasing in many countries,
there is a corresponding need to understand the risk of individuals
transitioning from healthy states to chronic disease states and death. We
searched PubMed without language restrictions for population-based studies
published between database inception and May 9, 2021, that evaluated transitions
between different health states using the search terms “multi-state
model”, “transitions”, “trajectories”, and
“population health”. We found seven studies that used multistate
models to estimate trajectories between different health conditions, but, due to
sparse data, these models did not fully cover the transition from health to
chronic disease and death.</p>

                <title>Added value of this study</title>
                <p id="P60">We describe the trajectories of ageing in a population of healthy, older
people and show that the most common transition was from health to cancer, which
affected 10·1% of participants. Disability or dementia, a surrogate of
loss of independence, occurred in 4·8% of participants, but only
12·3% of deaths were preceded by disability or dementia. Importantly,
80·6% of participants remained healthy. We also examined the effects of
age and sex on transition rates. Age was significantly associated with an
accelerated rate for most transitions. Male sex (<italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> female sex)
was significantly associated with an accelerated rate for five of 12
transitions.</p>

                <p id="P61">Our findings provide important evidence relevant for residential care
requirements and underscore the possible gains from effective prevention
strategies in ageing populations. Prevention might be at an individual level
through engagement with health-care professionals or at a population-wide level
(eg, via screening) to diminish the impact of risk factors that are often shared
between different diseases and that might be targeted by common evidence-based
interventions.</p>
