                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Emergency intubation of children with abnormal respiratory or cardiac physiology is a high-risk procedure and associated with a high incidence of adverse events including hypoxemia. Successful emergency intubation is dependent on inter-related patient and operator factors. Preoxygenation has been used to maximise oxygen reserves in the patient and to prolong the safe apnoeic time during the intubation phase. Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) prolongs the safe apnoeic window for a safe intubation during elective intubation. We designed a clinical trial to test the hypothesis that THRIVE reduces the frequency of adverse and hypoxemic events during emergency intubation in children and to test the hypothesis that this treatment is cost-effective compared with standard care.</p>

                  <p>The Kids THRIVE trial is a multicentre randomised controlled trial performed in participating emergency departments and paediatric intensive care units. 960 infants and children aged 0–16 years requiring emergency intubation for all reasons will be enrolled and allocated to THRIVE or control in a 1:1 allocation with stratification by site, age (&lt;1, 1–7 and &gt;7 years) and operator (junior and senior). Children allocated to THRIVE will receive weight appropriate transnasal flow rates with 100% oxygen, whereas children in the control arm will not receive any transnasal oxygen insufflation. The primary outcomes are defined as follows: (1) hypoxemic event during the intubation phase defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90% (patient-dependent variable) and (2) first intubation attempt success without hypoxemia (operator-dependent variable). Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Emergency intubation of the trachea in critically ill children represents one of the most challenging procedures that a clinician working with acutely ill children performs. The intubation of children with unstable physiology in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with a high rate (up to 40%) of life-threatening adverse events (AEs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Successful emergency intubation is dependent on inter-related patient and operator factors. While a large body of literature defines optimal practice in intubation and difficult airway management in controlled theatre settings, emergency intubations in critically ill children are characterised by a deteriorating, unstable patient, sometimes with features of a difficult airway, yet are predominantly managed by ED and ICU teams rather than anaesthetists.</p>
              <p>The incidence of paediatric emergency intubations is relatively low even in high-volume tertiary paediatric EDs, resulting in infrequent exposure of medical staff to this vital and time-critical procedure and limited practical experience in comparison to anaesthetists in an operating theatre setting. These challenges are even greater in regional and district hospitals, where paediatric emergency intubations represent relatively rare events. Therefore, techniques to optimise intubation conditions and improve patient-related and operator-dependent factors are essential to increase the safety of emergency paediatric intubations in all settings.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p>The most critical phase of intubation is the period when clinicians attempt to secure the airway with an endotracheal tube (ETT); during this phase, the child is apnoeic and residual oxygen capacity of the lung is being depleted. To improve child-related factors, preoxygenation prior to induction of anaesthesia has been described since 1955 as a mechanism for maximising oxygen reserves and therefore prolonging the safe apnoeic time available for intubation particularly in emergency and difficult intubations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Infants and children have, in comparison to adults, a much lower tolerance for emergency intubation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As a result, they are more likely to experience alveolar de-recruitment and significant oxygen desaturation. Recent studies have shown that any failed attempt of emergency intubation is associated with a prolonged need for mechanical ventilation in intensive care.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Preoxygenation does not supply an ongoing gas exchange and therefore there is an urgent need for newer methods to continue improved oxygenation during the apnoeic phase.</p>
              <p>We have recently shown that the safe apnoeic time in healthy infants and children undergoing elective intubation can be substantially extended with a new technique, called Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> THRIVE provides high-flow humidified oxygen through nasal cannulae and allows continued peri-laryngoscopy oxygen delivery during apnoea. The benefit of THRIVE in allowing more time for safe intubation is thus likely beneficial in those difficult anatomical airways and cardiorespiratory compromise during emergency intubation. There are currently no published randomised studies investigating the use of THRIVE or other forms of apnoeic oxygenation in emergency intubation in children. In the adult literature, there have been a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the topic of apnoeic oxygenation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–13</xref> In these reviews, there is significant heterogeneity in the studies included, and a paucity of adequately powered randomised trials. Overall, in adults there is a reduced frequency of oxygen desaturation when apnoeic oxygenation is used during intubation; however, this effect has not been demonstrated in patients with respiratory failure.</p>
              <p>In order to improve emergency intubation conditions in children, our aim is to investigate the efficacy of THRIVE in critically ill children aged between 0 and 16 years in a large multicentre trial. We hypothesise that THRIVE reduces the frequency of life-threatening oxygen desaturation and increases frequency of first attempt success without hypoxemia in emergent intubation of children compared with standard practice. We also aim to demonstrate that this leads to a reduced proportion of AEs and reduced length of mechanical ventilation or length of stay in intensive care. This project will assess health economic impacts and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, taking into account the heterogeneity of service users, health system, geographical and economic conditions and end implications for resource allocation from the payer’s perspective.</p>

Preoxygenation should be provided with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) for at least 3 min where possible. Where preoxygenation with high FiO<sub>2</sub> is contraindicated or considered not appropriate for the patient by the treating clinician (eg, single ventricle physiology, unbalanced circulations), the FiO<sub>2</sub> applied during the apnoeic phase should be the same as the FiO<sub>2</sub> used during preoxygenation. The method used, FiO<sub>2</sub> and duration of preoxygenation will be collected and reported.</p>

For the purposes of this study, the apnoeic phase will be defined as commencing at the time that the mask (or nasal prongs) used for preoxygenation or pre-intubation non-invasive ventilation (eg, by bag and mask) is removed from the face. This correlates approximately with the time of onset of paralysis or the initiation of the intubation attempt if assisted ventilation is required prior to intubation.

THRIVE is to be applied immediately when the mask for preoxygenation is removed from the face and will be maintained throughout the apnoeic period and during intubation attempts. Where NHF is used as a preoxygenation technique, it can remain in place for the intervention group, ensuring that the FiO<sub>2</sub> is 100%, or the FiO<sub>2</sub> is documented on the CRF in cases where high oxygen concentrations are contraindicated. THRIVE nasal prongs may be removed if rescue bag mask ventilation is required due to desaturation. The prongs will be removed on confirmation of successful ETT.</p>

                <p>In 2016, we audited 30 children undergoing intubation in Queensland Children’s Hospital ED, of which 12 (40%) needed a second or third attempt of intubation and 50% experienced an AE such as hypoxemia (10%), hypotension (8%), ETT misplacement (21%) and other (11%). Data obtained from 140 intubations in PICU showed similar results with 30% requiring more than one attempt. This proportion of the hypoxemia primary outcome occurrence and AEs in our own audit data is comparable to a recent publication reporting emergency intubation in the USA.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In this setting, the authors described that in 1256 children undergoing emergency intubation, 16% of children experienced a desaturation to less than 80% during the first attempt of intubation and on average 40% required a second attempt at least. In this paper, the authors describe per age group a very similar distribution of failed attempts, with age groups defined &lt;1, 1–7 and &gt;7 years. A conservative estimate of the primary outcome of hypoxemia is set at 16%. We assume 90% power to detect a 50% reduction of desaturation events (hypoxia) from 16% to 8% and an alpha of 0.025 (Bonferroni’s correction for two primary outcomes), resulting in 816 participants required. For our other primary outcome, successful first attempt intubation, we estimate an increase from 60% to 80%; with 90% power and an alpha of 0.025, 258 participants are required. Therefore, an overall total sample of 960 children is required including 15% attrition which satisfies the sample size requirements for both outcomes.</p>

For continuous outcomes, it will first be determined whether the data are normally distributed; if so, a t-test will be used for comparison, otherwise, a Mann-Whitney U test will be used. Analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Statistical significance will be set at the 0.025 level for primary outcomes, and 0.05 for other comparisons. Post-hoc power analyses may be undertaken to determine whether results found in subgroup analyses are reliable particularly for age groups (&lt;1, 1–7 and &gt;7 years).

Unit costs will be extracted from standard sources. A standard within-trial cost utility analysis will be undertaken under the horizon of 28 days. This will compare costs and benefits in terms of resource use related to the intervention and other care and length of stay in both PICU and non-intensive care. Estimates of mean costs and CIs will be provided. Models will include sensitivity analysis. Resource use data will be collected for trial participants and the collated unit costs will be assigned to the resource utilisation to provide overall costs for both arms of the trial. The analysis will be from the healthcare provider perspective. The New Zealand country healthcare costs will be analysed separately and findings from different systems will be compared.</p>

                <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                <p>One of the primary challenges in performing research in an emergency setting is the inability to obtain true informed consent. Frequently, parents and guardians are not initially available when their child is brought into the ED. Furthermore, when parents or guardians are present, they are often too distressed by the situation to comprehend study procedures and there is not enough time to obtain informed consent.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref>
</p>
                <p>In all participating centres, prospective consent will be obtained from the parent or guardian where possible. When prospective consent is not possible or practical, and local legislation allows, patients will be randomised to the study and written informed consent to remain in the study will be sought from parents and guardians at the earliest possible time after emergency stabilisation of the child (consent-to-continue). Data for children whose parents and guardians do not wish for their child to remain in the study will be handled according to local hospital policies, and the data will not be available for analysis.</p>
                <p>This study has ethical approval for consent-to-continue (deferred consent) for participating Australian sites. For sites in New Zealand, approval has been received for prospective consent only due to local regulatory requirements. The method of consent will be presented for all enrolled patients, along with summary data for patients eligible but not enrolled.</p>
                <p>Results from the study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication and for presentation at national and international conferences. Once the outcomes are known, targeted knowledge translation activities will be developed and work to incorporate the results into airway management guidelines will be undertaken.</p>

                <p>The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consists of an anaesthetist, a paediatric intensivist and a statistician. None of the DSMB members will be involved in recruitment of study patients at their site. DSMB members will not be supervised by any study investigator, or participate as investigators in any study currently under review by this DSMB. The primary objective of the DSMB is to monitor the safety of the intervention and the validity and integrity of the data from the Kids THRIVE study. Additionally, the DSMB will evaluate the pace of recruitment and will make recommendations to the Kids THRIVE Chief Investigator(s) and Steering Board regarding the continuation, modification or termination of the study.</p>
                <p>AE data are collected as part of the study design and form the primary and secondary outcomes of the study. Conditions that are present at screening and do not deteriorate will not be considered AEs. Patients participating in this trial are critically ill and the reason for requiring the intubation is often respiratory, neurological or cardiovascular failure with acute risk of death. Except for death during or within 1 hour of intubation and oesophageal intubation with late recognition, AEs as listed in the outcome parameters are expected and according to current clinical practice ‘accepted’ outcomes. Hence, these outcomes are not routinely reported as AEs nor to the DSMB. However, if any of the attending clinicians suspect an AE that is related to the study design, such an AE will be reported.</p>
                <p>Serious AEs are defined as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cardiac arrest or death during or within an hour of the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Oesophageal intubation with late recognition</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>Any serious AE will be reported to the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) within 24–72 hours of occurrence, in accordance with the safety reporting policy of the HREC. Set DSMB review points on the progress and safety of the trial are predefined as after the primary outcome is known for 200 children.</p>

                <title>Data accuracy and integrity</title>
                <p>Intubation and ventilation of a child in the ED and ICU settings represent a highly stressful event and require significant human resources to assemble equipment while effectively managing a critically unwell patient. As a result, attention to data collection for a research study is often overlooked, with the immediate needs of the patient always taking priority. This study is dependent on high-quality and accurate data at a critical moment of the patient’s management, and the potential for missing or inaccurate data collection is high. It is also recognised that significant bias can be introduced to a study of this type when relying on retrospective recall of critical data values. A retrospective review of intubation records compared with video-recorded data has highlighted that there is a significant under-reporting of AEs, especially oxygen desaturation, and an over-reporting of first-attempt success rates, in the magnitude of 21% and 12%, respectively, when reliant on operator-/observer-reported data.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p>
                <p>For this reason, a video recording of the intubation procedure will be captured for data verification purposes and to protect the integrity of the primary end point. Where a discrepancy between the manually recorded data and video-recorded data exists, the video-recorded data will be used for analysis as it can be objectively confirmed.</p>

              <title>Significance</title>
              <p>This large multicentre randomised trial may help define the role of THRIVE during emergency intubation in infants and children. The intubation of a child in the emergency setting places a tremendous emotional strain on both the child and parents. Dependent on the skill level and experience of the clinician performing the procedure, the professional stress level may also be very high as intubation is a high-risk procedure, which needs to be accomplished in a timely manner. The study will provide high-fidelity data using video recording of the study interventions and the findings will easily be translated into clinical practice.</p>
