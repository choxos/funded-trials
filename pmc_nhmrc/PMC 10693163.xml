                  <p id="Par1">Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common globally, but there is a lack of research on how to intervene early with men who might be using IPV. Building on evidence supporting the benefits of online interventions for women victim/survivors, this study aims to test whether a healthy relationship website (BETTER MAN) is effective at improving men’s help seeking, their recognition of behaviours as IPV and their readiness to change their behaviours.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">In this two-group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, men aged 18–50 years residing in Australia who have been in an adult intimate relationship (female, male or non-binary partner) in the past 12 months are eligible. Men who report being worried about their behaviour or have had others express concerns about their behaviour towards a partner in the past 12 months will be randomised with a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive the BETTER MAN website or a comparator website (basic healthy relationships information). The BETTER MAN intervention includes self-directed, interactive reflection activities spread across three modules: Better Relationships, Better Values and Better Communication, with a final “action plan” of strategies and resources. Using an intention to treat approach, the primary analysis will estimate between-group difference in the proportion of men who report undertaking help-seeking behaviours for relationship issues in the last 6 months, at 6 months post-baseline. Analysis of secondary outcomes will estimate between-group differences in: (i) mean score of awareness of behaviours in relationships as abusive immediately post-use of website; (ii) mean score on readiness to change immediately post-use of website and 3 months after baseline; and (iii) cost-effectiveness.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem worldwide. It is defined as any behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical, psychological, or sexual harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and is primarily perpetrated by men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Australia, one in five women report physical or sexual abuse by a male partner, similar to other high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Men and non-binary people also report male-perpetrated IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This violence results in annual costs estimated at $21.7 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], more than well-recognised epidemics such as diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and mental health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, children exposed to IPV can experience intergenerational trauma, causing emotional and behavioural problems persisting into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent need for testing interventions that could help reduce the use of IPV in intimate relationships.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Although IPV can be perpetrated by people of any gender, men use IPV most frequently and severely. Moreover, studies show that IPV is the most common cause of injury for female victims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This has led to IPV research in healthcare settings and online focusing on interventions for women survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Yet, current policy and practice suggest that efforts to end IPV must also target men potentially using IPV in their intimate relationships with female, male and non-binary partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Responses to men’s use of IPV</title>
                <p id="Par8">Men’s use of IPV is associated with increased alcohol and substance abuse, depression, suicide, anxiety, low self-esteem, and use of health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Yet responses mainly utilise a criminal justice lens rather than exploring early intervention through health or community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Australia, the preferred referral pathway for men who use IPV is men’s behaviour change group programs (MBCPs). Topics covered by these programs include: masculinity, conflict resolution, anger management, emotional regulation, communication skills, fatherhood, alcohol and drug use, trauma, stress, beliefs that reinforce abuse and maladaptive beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. MBCPs have mixed evidence of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with a review of Australian MBCPs suggesting that key issues are getting men to participate and remain in the programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A systematic review of qualitative studies found that men who volunteer for MBCPs are more likely to sustain change compared with those court mandated or driven by need to be allowed home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Yet only a limited number of MBCP participants enrol in programs voluntarily, whilst more often men are mandated into a MBCP once they enter the justice system. As a result, many men in the community who use IPV in Australia are not reached at an earlier stage in their trajectory of using IPV.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Experts and peak bodies agree that we need to engage men who use IPV earlier to seek help from services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Commonwealth’s National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children calls for testing of effectiveness of early intervention models targeting men in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To enable this earlier delivery of interventions targeting voluntary men with internal motivations for change, engagement needs to change from justice to health and community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of evidence from health care settings and no trials of early interventions for men drawn from the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Theoretically-driven and consumer-informed elements have been successfully transferred from face-to-face to online interventions for other male social problems, such as alcohol misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, evidence of effectiveness for online interventions for men who may be using IPV is still lacking.</p>

                <title>Evidence informing the development and design of BETTER MAN</title>
                <p id="Par10">To address the gap in knowledge and tools for men who may use IPV, we developed an innovative online early intervention that engages men in the community, providing them with awareness and motivation to seek help for their behaviours before the justice system intervenes. This novel early intervention is an online healthy relationship tool called BETTER MAN. It aims to increase men’s early engagement with help-seeking to ultimately reduce use of IPV (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for Theory of Change).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Theory of Change for the BETTER MAN intervention; a pathway to help-seeking to enable safety for partners</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2023_17032_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par11">BETTER MAN is based on consultation with end-users and sector specialists, guided by research evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], is theoretically-informed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and follows best-practice human-computer interaction principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par12">Development of BETTER MAN involved working with end-users and analysing qualitative data on how to engage men to seek help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In 2017, three focus groups were held with end-users (23 men from MBCPs) who chose the website name, contributed to content and advised on use of appropriate language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In 2018, in two focus groups (21 men from MBCPs) participants suggested using soft language to approach the issue, engaging men through broader health concerns, not making them feel judged and promoting hope for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In 2019, we undertook a pilot study to test the website content/navigation, ensure usability and confirm project recruitment methods and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The pilot showed that recruitment to a BETTER MAN trial is feasible, with 162 men enrolling over a three-week period, who then completed online assessments at baseline, immediately on completion of modules (79%, 111 men) and three months post-baseline (63%, 86 men). Further details [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] show the sample included men who were culturally diverse, with 33% born outside Australia (33%). 19% were in a same-sex relationship, and 2.2% identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Positive findings included an increase in mean intention to contact a confidential counselling service and a change in men’s readiness to make changes in behaviour. Most men (90%) found the website acceptable, stating they did not feel judged by BETTER MAN. They also stated that it helped them to acknowledge what was happening in their relationship and think about making changes, as well as offering ongoing support. We suggest that BETTER MAN potentially overcomes stigma for men who may be using IPV, as it is seen as private, accessible and non-judgemental, particularly important for men from diverse backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, BETTER MAN requires testing through a randomised controlled trial, to enable the website to be rigorously evaluated with a diverse group of men.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par20">Recruitment will be conducted nationally across Australia using a combination of recruitment strategies we have successfully used in previous studies with men who use IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The strategies include targeting a wide range of men, not only those who have already acknowledged use of IPV and are using support services. We will recruit men online using a mixture of men’s health, community, or domestic violence-related websites, as well as social media (e.g., Facebook, Gumtree, Google, eBay, Twitter, Instagram). We will also display advertisement material in public spaces such as sports clubs, libraries and hotels. We will reach out to workplaces with large numbers of male employees (e.g., mining and construction companies, unions, banks) to partner with us to advertise the project through newsletters and communications. We will also use online research panels to reach pre-recruited men who suit the trial eligibility requirements. Finally, we will recruit men through people in their close circles (e.g. partners, family members, friends) who feel worried about their behaviour. Online advertisements targeting these people will also be distributed using relevant websites and social media.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Interested men will click directly on the link or scan the QR code provided in the advertisement which directs them to a landing page where information about the project is displayed. Advertisements targeting partners, family members, and friends with concerns about a man’s behaviour in his relationship lead them to a separate landing page with general information about the project and a shareable link to the men’s page. Participants will be able to download a PDF copy of the project information sheet for their records.</p>
                <p id="Par22">From the landing page, men can click through to the study registration website. There, they will be required to complete the eligibility screening questionnaire (age, residence and concerns about behaviour questions) and provide informed consent prior to proceeding. A phone number will be provided for men to contact the research team with queries, as well as a study email address for technical difficulties.</p>
                <p id="Par23">To recruit the sub-sample of participants’ partners, we will follow standard MBCP practice and ask men if they agree to their partners being invited to participate in a brief survey. Those who agree will be asked to provide their partner’s contact details (first name and email address). At the 3-month timepoint, partners will be invited by email to participate in a short online or telephone survey about their relationship (men will not know if their partner participates). Those interested in participating will be directed to a registration website to review the study information and provide informed consent. A phone number will be provided for partners to contact the research team with queries, as well as an email address for technical difficulties. Partners will also be invited to take part in an optional longer interview with a member of the research team.</p>

These details will be manually checked against the Australian Electoral Roll by a team member as a safeguard against fraudulent participants and bots. If the person’s details are not on the Electoral Roll, the participant will be contacted by email and asked for further information. If there is a valid reason for a participant not being registered to vote (e.g., due to age or visa status), he will be asked to confirm his details with a research assistant over the phone. Once the participant’s identity is validated, he will be accrued into the study. Upon verification, participants will receive an automated email with a personalised link to the baseline survey; the link will be deactivated once the participant has completed the survey.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2023_17032_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

Previous MI approaches to engage men prior to MBCPs have demonstrated significant increases in program attendance and completion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. MI techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] used throughout BETTER MAN encourage awareness and self-reflection, reduce stigma, and improve communication skills. They enable men, who will vary in their readiness to change, to weigh up their situation and options, to form action plans that meet their personal priorities, tailored to their self-perceived Stage of Change (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance). With the ultimate aim of improving safety for partners and children, BETTER MAN involves the following MI techniques: Engage, Focus, Evoke, Plan (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par41">The BETTER MAN website is composed of three sequential modules: Better Communication, Better Values, and Better Relationships, with all modules having online messaging tailored to user input. The Better Communication module explores how a man’s communication style may differ with a partner compared to others, and promotes positive communication (e.g., listening, staying calm). The module also contains a grounding breathing exercise and an activity for recognising signals of potentially abusive behaviour. The Better Values module explores how a man’s behaviour in relationships aligns with his self-identified values using hypothetical scenarios to highlight discrepancy between values and behaviour. The Better Relationships module encourages a man to reflect on the health of his relationship and his use of controlling behaviour and violence (physical, emotional, sexual abuse), and weigh up pros/cons of his relationship (including with his children if applicable). A final Action Plan section reinforces help seeking and provides resources for related areas (e.g., parenting, alcohol/drug use, mental health). The modules take about 30 min and men can go back to the website any time.</p>

                <p id="Par42">Men in the comparison group will be directed to an alternate website representing the usual available resources and standard care for men seeking help online in Australia. This website will be specially built for the study based on content from HealthDirect, a government-funded service providing quality, approved information about a range of health topics. One of the website sections is about how to build and maintain healthy relationships with partners and family members. The section answers questions such as: What are the signs of a healthy relationship? What are the benefits of healthy relationships? Communication in a healthy relationship? How can I maintain healthy relationships? The website also provides a list of resources for support, a comprehensive directory of Australian websites that people can search for further related information and a 24-hour health advice hotline. The comparison website will be built in a way that reflects the contents in the HealthDirect section on healthy relationships.</p>

Additionally, BETTER MAN is designed with a ‘quick escape’ bar that allows immediate exit and log out from BETTER MAN and returns the user to a weather forecast website. All automated emails sent to participants have the subject header “Better Man Project” and come from a generic email address (mens-health@unimelb.edu.au). Should a participant contact a member of the research team because they are upset due to their participation in BETTER MAN, the researchers will refer to the study distress protocol in their response. The protocol includes exploring with the individual whether they have someone they can talk to who will understand and be supportive. The research team member will discuss with the participant where they might seek support, including from the agencies detailed on the resource list provided to all participants. In the unlikely event that a participant discloses child sexual abuse in their answer to the few open-ended questions in the surveys, researchers will follow State-based mandatory reporting requirements. Participants are able to withdraw from the trial at any time on request.</p>
                  <p id="Par45">Regular team meetings will be held for researchers to debrief about the project and any incidents that have arisen. If researchers are distressed at any time from the work, they will be offered referrals for appropriate counselling.</p>

Primary analysis will use an intention to treat approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], where all individuals will be included in the analysis according to the study group they were assigned, whether they completed all, part or none of the intended intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par57">Logistic regression will be used to estimate the odds ratio of men’s help seeking activities at 6 months for the intervention against the comparison group. Generalised linear model with the identity link function and binomial family will be used to estimate the absolute difference in the percentage of men’s help seeking activities between the two study groups. Both models will adjust for whether the participant had children or did not have children and self-reported help-seeking behaviours measured at baseline. The estimated intervention effect for the primary outcome will be presented as both an odds ratio comparing the intervention to the comparison group (relative effect) and between-group difference in the percentages (absolute effect) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI), and the p-values estimated using logistic regression.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">Mixed effects linear regression models will be used to estimate the between group difference in the mean scores for the secondary continuous outcomes, namely, awareness of behaviours as abusive immediately after the use of the website completion, and readiness to change at two assessment time points, after the use of the website completion and 3 months post-baseline. Study group and time of measurement and whether the participants had children will be included as fixed effect and random intercept terms for individuals (to account for repeated measurement). A two-way interaction between the study group and time will be fitted to estimate the between-group difference in mean outcome at each measurement time point, but we will constrain the baseline means between the study groups to be equal. The estimates will be presented as difference in the mean outcome between the intervention and comparison groups at immediate post-intervention and 3 months (as appropriate), with 95% confidence intervals and p-values.</p>
                  <p id="Par59">Handling of missing data will be detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) informed by a blinded review of data. The SAP will also elaborate on additional analyses such as sensitivity analyses, analysis to assess non-adherence to the intervention on the estimated intervention effects and mediator/moderator analyses. The SAP will be made available prior to the statistical analysis of the primary outcome.</p>

The six-month time duration avoids the need for discounting. Economic evaluation will, as a first step, present a cost-consequences analysis with costs presented separately for government and men compared with the difference in all outcome measures.

We will use Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] to explore the meanings men attach to behaviour change and how these meanings change over time. We will also examine what supports or services have been helpful and what factors may impede or facilitate change processes.

                  <p id="Par63">Semi-structured, in-depth interviews will be conducted via telephone with a sub-sample of up to 30 men and their partners (we estimate up to 10 partners may be recruited based on our pilot work) immediately after completion of BETTER MAN, and at 3 and 6-months post-use. We will recruit by asking men who complete the post-use survey if they are interested in taking part in an interview. Where possible, we will aim for diversity in terms of demographic factors (e.g., cultural background, location, sexual orientation). All interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim. Our analysis will take a trajectory approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], which aims to examine the experiences of the same group of participants over time.

              <p id="Par64">Evidence to inform practice and policy about early intervention with men’s use of IPV in community and health settings is urgently needed. There is a strong rationale for developing and testing online early interventions to reach men in the community who may use IPV. With an increasing demand for services and a community sector that is overworked, the community needs novel ways of addressing the issue of IPV that are rigorously evaluated. This trial evaluates primarily the effect of an online healthy relationship tool on men’s help-seeking for their behaviours in intimate relationships. Well-designed theoretically and consumer informed interventions need testing through randomised controlled trials that incorporate economic and process evaluations. If successful, the trial would provide strong evidence for an entirely new way of addressing and assisting men who might use IPV to seek help. With evidence for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, the evidence-informed website to assist men to seek help to reduce use of IPV, could be easily incorporated into practice both within the community sector and in health settings. BETTER MAN also has the potential to be scaled up for international delivery. The trial will also add to the knowledge base around internet-based trials, online recruitment of men and retention processes.</p>
