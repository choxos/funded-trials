                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The prevailing medical opinion is that medication is the primary (some might argue, only) effective intervention for osteoporosis. It is nevertheless recognized that osteoporosis medications are not universally effective, tolerated, or acceptable to patients. Mechanical loading, such as vibration and exercise, can also be osteogenic but the degree, relative efficacy, and combined effect is unknown. The purpose of the VIBMOR trial is to determine the efficacy of low-intensity whole-body vibration (LIV), bone-targeted, high-intensity resistance and impact training (HiRIT), or the combination of LIV and HiRIT on risk factors for hip fracture in postmenopausal women with osteopenia and osteoporosis.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Postmenopausal women with low areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the proximal femur and/or lumbar spine, with or without a history of fragility fracture, and either on or off osteoporosis medications will be recruited. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to one of four trial arms for 9 months: LIV, HiRIT, LIV + HiRIT, or control (low-intensity, home-based exercise). Allocation will be block-randomized, stratified by use of osteoporosis medications. Testing will be performed at three time points: baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1; 9 months), and 1 year thereafter (T2; 21 months) to examine detraining effects. The primary outcome measure will be total hip aBMD determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary outcomes will include aBMD at other regions, anthropometrics, and other indices of bone strength, body composition, physical function, kyphosis, muscle strength and power, balance, falls, and intervention compliance. Exploratory outcomes include bone turnover markers, pelvic floor health, quality of life, physical activity enjoyment, adverse events, and fracture. An economic evaluation will also be conducted.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">No previous studies have compared the effect of LIV alone or in combination with bone-targeted HiRIT (with or without osteoporosis medications) on risk factors for hip fracture in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. Should either, both, or combined mechanical interventions be safe and efficacious, alternative therapeutic avenues will be available to individuals at elevated risk of fragility fracture who are unresponsive to or unwilling or unable to take osteoporosis medications.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par42">Osteoporosis is defined as a progressive, systemic skeletal disease characterized by profound loss of bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration, the consequence of which is increased bone fragility and risk of fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although either sex can be affected, osteoporosis is considerably more common in women than men. Virtually any bone can be affected, but fractures occur most often at the vertebrae and distal forearm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Proximal femur (“hip”) fractures cause the greatest personal and economic burden. Adverse sequelae of hip fractures include severe pain, disability, hospitalization, surgery, and loss of independence, all of which have substantial negative impact on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The economic impact of hip fractures is substantial and rising. In Australian women aged 50 and over, the total direct costs equated to $734 million in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to Watts and colleagues (2013), the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in older women (i.e., 50 years of age) will increase from 2.62 million in 2012 to 3.44 million in 2022, with a commensurate 25% increase in hip fractures in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These figures highlight the burden of poor bone health in older women, and the need for effective prevention strategies.</p>
              <p id="Par43">The primary therapeutic approach to manage osteoporosis and fracture prevention is pharmacotherapy, comprising antiresorptive (bisphosphonates, denosumab, hormone therapy) and anabolic (teriparatide and romosozumab) agents, which have varying degrees of antifracture efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A proportion of individuals fail to respond to osteoporosis medications, suffering incident fracture or continued loss of bone mass over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, over 90% of hip fractures are a direct result of a fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and medications do not reduce falls or even improve important risk factors for falling such as muscle strength and balance. It is perhaps unsurprising then that osteoporosis medication uptake is low and adherence (compliance and persistence) decreases over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite an increasing prevalence of osteoporosis, adoption of medication dropped by 15% in Australia from 2007 to 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], a likely consequence of a number of severe, albeit rare, adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] that received considerable media attention. Given the scale and burden of osteoporotic fracture, the limitations of pharmacotherapy and the reluctance of many patients to take them, the identification of effective non-pharmacological strategies for the prevention and management of osteoporosis is pressing.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Traditionally, exercise has been considered only an ancillary strategy to prevent osteoporotic fracture. The inherent fragility of an osteoporotic skeleton typically motivates clinicians to recommend exercise at only low intensity to avoid load-related fracture. Unfortunately, low-intensity exercise is rarely sufficient to increase bone mass and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While animal studies confirm that high-magnitude loads are necessary to stimulate bone accretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the translation to clinical practice has been hampered by safety concerns. Recently, however, a series of trials have challenged this reticence. The LIFTMOR trial for postmenopausal women with low bone mass, and the LIFTMOR-M trial for older men (also with low bone mass), found that high-intensity progressive resistance and impact training (HiRIT) improved bone mass and other risk factors for falls and fracture, with no serious adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the HiRIT program improved thoracic kyphosis and was not associated with an increased risk of incident vertebral fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">It has also been observed from animal studies that light loads applied at sufficiently fast rates, in the order of 30 Hz, can also enhance bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As it is not physically possible to move the body fast enough to apply loads to the skeleton at 30 Hz, low-intensity whole-body vibration (LIV) devices were developed to do so passively. If effective, LIV may be an appealing osteoporosis therapy for individuals unwilling or unable to exercise at high loads. Extensive work in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], turkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] has shown LIV can normalize bone endpoints in human and animal models of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In mice, LIV improved disuse-associated bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], restored bone lost prior to reambulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and regenerated periosteal bone subsequent to surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] by suppressing bone resorption and increasing bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In humans, LIV (30 Hz at 0.3 to 0.4 <italic>g</italic>) enhanced bone density in children with cerebral palsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], Duchenne muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and scoliosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. LIV has been observed to reduce bone loss in patients with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and young women with low bone mineral density (BMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par46">Results from vibration trials in postmenopausal women have been equivocal with discrepancies potentially due to vibration stimulus heterogeneity (e.g., frequency, magnitude, and cumulative dose) and inconsistent use of control groups (e.g., inactive control group or sham/placebo vibration). It has been suggested that vibration enhances bone mass only at certain sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], or reduces falls but has no effect on bone mass in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The single pilot trial comparing whole-body vibration (WBV) with exercise training in postmenopausal women showed vibration (amplitude 1.7–2.5 mm, frequency 35–40 Hz) improved total hip (TH) BMD more than moderate-intensity resistance training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The single trial examining the combined effect of WBV and exercise on falls and fracture risk parameters reported no difference in effect of WBV plus exercise versus exercise alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The safety of the high-intensity vibration stimulus employed in the latter trials for the osteoporotic demographic is of some concern. No trial has conducted a head-to head comparison of LIV with or without a known efficacious exercise protocol (i.e., HiRIT) on indices of hip fracture risk in postmenopausal women with low bone mass.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Therefore, the overarching aim of the “Vibration and exercise Intervention for Bone, Muscle and Osteoporosis Rehabilitation” (VIBMOR) trial is to determine the effects of 9 months of 5 days per week, 10 min, LIV (0.4 <italic>g</italic>, 30 Hz) on risk factors for hip fracture in postmenopausal women with low to very low bone mass, with or without twice-weekly, 30 min, bone-targeted HiRIT. Intervention responses will be compared with a 9-month, twice-weekly, 30 min, home-based, low-intensity exercise program known to be an ineffective bone stimulus (a.k.a. active control). We will also explore whether any effects are maintained after detraining (removal of stimulus). Quality of life and cost-effectiveness will also be examined. We hypothesize that the combination of LIV and HiRIT will improve primary and secondary outcomes more than either therapy alone (that is, LIV or HiRIT), or control.</p>

                <title>Study aims</title>
                <p id="Par49">The primary aim of the VIBMOR trial is to compare the efficacy of LIV, alone and in combination with HiRIT, with and without osteoporosis drugs, to improve risk factors for hip fracture in postmenopausal women with low to very low bone mass. While fracture per se is the outcome of greatest clinical concern, it has been projected that adopting a hip fracture endpoint in an exercise trial would require a sample size so large (approximately <italic>n</italic> = 14,000) as to be unfundable and is therefore unlikely to ever be attempted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. DXA-derived aBMD is strongly negatively associated with fragility fracture in women, thus the application of aBMD as a surrogate endpoint for fracture in osteoporosis research is justified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and routinely adopted. The practice has recently been statistically validated through meta-regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, in the proposed trial, intervention efficacy will be assessed based on known risk factors for hip fracture: primarily, TH aBMD as well as other indices of bone strength. Our secondary outcomes will include falls and fall risk factors through indices of muscle strength, dynamic and static balance, and physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Exploratory outcomes will provide preliminary insight into mechanisms (bone turnover markers), and potential ancillary benefits (pelvic floor health and dysfunction, fracture, quality of life), feasibility (compliance, physical activity enjoyment), and safety (adverse events) of the interventions. Analyses will be adjusted for presence or absence of osteoporosis medication, intervention compliance, dietary calcium, and serum vitamin D.</p>

                <title>Study design and description</title>
                <p id="Par50">VIBMOR is a single-center, 21-month, four-arm, single-blind, block-randomized controlled trial. The trial is divided into two phases, a 9-month treatment intervention followed by 1-year withdrawal of treatment to monitor detraining effects. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram of proposed participant flow through the trial is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, and the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) schedule of enrollment, interventions and assessments is illustrated in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The 9-month exercise intervention period has been chosen as the minimum time frame in which notable changes to bone mass are likely to be detected from densitometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

                <p id="Par51">Baseline and follow-up assessments will be conducted in the Bone Densitometry Research Laboratory, Griffith University, Gold Coast campus, Queensland, Australia. All supervised training sessions will be conducted in the Strength Training Research Facility, co-located in the School of Health Sciences and Social Work. All trial-related activities, measurements and interventions will be conducted at this single location (Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia).</p>
                <p id="Par52">Participants will be postmenopausal women with low aBMD (TH, femoral neck [FN] and/or LS aBMD <italic>T</italic>-score ≤ − 1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]) with or without previous fragility fracture. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of four groups: LIV, HiRIT, LIV + HiRIT, or control. Group allocation will be block-randomized according to use of osteoporosis medications as follows: (1) have not been taking any osteoporosis medications for the preceding 12 months and do not intend to start taking any such drug in the subsequent 21 months, and (2) have been taking antiresorptive osteoporosis medications for the preceding 12 months and intend to continue taking the same drug in the subsequent 21 months.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Testing of all outcome measures will be performed at three time points, baseline (T0), 9 months (T1), and 21 months (T2). LIV, HiRIT, and control group compliance will be monitored across the 9-month intervention period, while safety (adverse events and injuries), healthcare utilization, falls, and fractures will be monitored across the entire 21-month trial period.</p>
                <p id="Par54">Logistic regression models will be used to establish and compare the ratios of positive musculoskeletal, functional, and falls-related outcomes in the four groups. An economic evaluation will also be carried out.</p>
                <p id="Par55">Participants in all groups will be invited to attend morning tea meetings at 3-monthly intervals. To build rapport and maximize retention, the meetings will have a primarily social function, but will also be opportunities to examine study diaries and encourage participants to continue to fill them out. Attendees will be instructed not to divulge or discuss group allocation at these meetings.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par57">Bone loss occurs across the lifespan after the achievement of peak bone mass in young adulthood, an effect that is particularly marked in the years immediately post menopause. In our experience, roughly 30% of postmenopausal women of the age recruited for the current study do not lose hip aBMD over the course of a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In the absence of published data indicating the minimum percent improvement in the proportion of women losing bone over the course of a year required for public health benefit, we based our power calculations on a conservative estimate of 20%. Thus, from a two-sample difference of proportions test for 80% power with type 1 error of 5%, a sample size of 186 is required to detect hip aBMD maintenance or gain in 50% of the LIV group (30% + 20%). (To detect a greater improvement requires fewer participants, e.g., 30% difference requires, <italic>n</italic> = 84.) Our fully supervised, pilot study experienced a modest participant dropout of 6%. As a 2-year, home-based study could potentially experience greater attrition, we will over-recruit by 15% to power our secondary analyses. Thus, to test our primary hypothesis, we will recruit 214 participants (186 + 28). We therefore plan to recruit 428 participants, with 107 in each of the four arms (that is, LIV, HiRIT, LIV + HiRIT, and control).</p>
                <p id="Par58">We recognize a more traditional statistical approach is to compare actual change in aBMD between groups. We are reluctant to adopt the latter analysis as a primary approach because the absolute amount of change in hip aBMD that translates to a clinically significant effect has never been established. By contrast, it is well-recognized that prevention of any degree of age-related bone loss is highly clinically relevant if it prevents bone mass from falling below a fracture threshold. Thus, in our study population, maintenance or gain of total hip aBMD is the more justifiable clinical goal than absolute change in aBMD. Nevertheless, for the purposes of comparison with previous trials, we will perform both analyses and are powered to do so. To detect a 1.45% aBMD difference with 3.5% SD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], at <italic>α</italic> = 0.05, for 80% power requires a group <italic>n</italic> of 92. 92 × 4 = 368 + 15% attrition allowance (13.8 × 4) = 423.2; essentially equivalent to our planned sample of 428. We will also perform per protocol analyses adjusting for compliance and any variable that differs between groups at baseline.</p>

Randomization of eligible participants to one of the four groups will be performed using permuted blocks of random sizes, stratified by the presence (≥ 12 months exposure) or absence (lack of exposure) of osteoporosis medications for at least 12 months with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio. The allocation sequence has been prepared in advance under the supervision of the trial biostatistician (SKP) who is not located at Griffith University and therefore will not be involved in any participant-facing procedures such as recruitment, screening, testing, group allocation, or intervention delivery. The allocation sequence has been filed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. A random subset (25%) of eligible participants will undergo blood collection for 25(OH)D and bone biomarker assessment at the three testing time points.

The Marodyne LivMD low-intensity vibration platform has been registered and approved as a medical device with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods Certificate/ARTG identifier: 317506, Issued to RehaCare Pty Ltd). The Marodyne LivMD delivers a low-magnitude, vertical 30 Hz oscillation resulting in accelerations of 0.4<italic>g</italic> (where <italic>g</italic> is Earth’s gravitational field) which fall within safe exposure limits outlined by the International Standards Organisation for daily threshold limit values (ISO-2631) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par92">Trial staff will deliver and install LIV devices in the homes of participants allocated to LIV groups and perform training in its use. The LIV devices are programmed to operate for 10-min treatment epochs. Participants will be required to stand on the platform for one 10-min session, 5 days per week for nine months. Each device is equipped with an in-built electronic monitoring system that automatically records the date, time, and duration of device use. Transmissibility of the LIV stimulus to the lower appendicular and axial skeletal is inversely related to knee flexion angle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and positively related to straightness of stance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Therefore, participants will be instructed to stand on the device with weight distributed evenly on each foot, knees extended, and trunk upright. Participants will receive a device operation manual and be instructed to contact the research team immediately should the device malfunction. A replacement device will be delivered to the participant promptly to avoid disruption of the intervention protocol. On completion of the 9-month period, the allocated device will be collected by trial staff or returned to the trial site by the participant. Following installation of the LIV platform, weekly calls will be made to participants for the first fortnight to check the device is operational and ensure sessions have been completed. Monthly emails will act as reminders to complete LIV diary entries and reinforce the required treatment exposure of five × 10 min per week of LIV therapy.</p>

The home-based, unsupervised, control regime will be comprised of two 30-min sessions per week on non-consecutive days, consisting of a 10-min walking warm-up, four stretches (neck, shoulder, calf, and lateral trunk flexion stretch) and low-resistance exercises with a focus on flexibility, lower limb muscular endurance, and balance, followed by a 5-min warm-down walk. The four low-resistance exercises can be selected from a battery of options to maintain variety (sit-to-stands, toe walks, alternating leg lunges, bilateral calf raises, standing forward shoulder raise, and shrugs). Intensity of the resistance exercises will be progressed mildly by increasing load (from no weight during the familiarization period, to 1 and 2 kg dumbbells, to a maximum of 3 kg) and increasing repetitions across the intervention period (to a maximum of three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions at ≤ 60% of one RM).

                    <p id="Par99">Height will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm, with the head positioned in the Frankfort plane, using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Model 216, Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a mechanical beam scale (Model 700, Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Height and weight will be measured without shoes and in light clothing. BMI will be calculated per the standard formula (BMI = weight/height<sup>2</sup>, kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
                    <p id="Par100">Waist circumference will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a steel anthropometric tape at the mid-point between the lower margins of the most inferior ribs and the superior margin of the iliac crests on bare skin at the end of gentle expiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p>
                    <p id="Par101">Lean mass (kg), fat mass (kg), percentage body fat (%), and appendicular lean mass (kg) will be derived from WB DXA (Norland at Swissray, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA; host software Version 4.7.4). Muscle cross-sectional area (cm<sup>2</sup>) and muscle density (mg/cm<sup>3</sup>) will be examined at the 66% site of the leg and forearm using pQCT (Stratec XCT-3000, Medizintechnick GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). Coefficients of variation for pQCT-derived muscle cross-sectional area and density in our lab are 0.66% and 0.75% at the leg and 1.02% and 0.44% at the forearm, respectively.</p>
                    <p id="Par102">Thoracic kyphosis will be assessed manually using a gravity-referenced inclinometer (Plurimeter, Australasian Medical &amp; Therapeutic Instruments, Australia) following a procedure similar to that outlined by Harding and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thoracic kyphosis will be determined in two postures: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] relaxed standing (neutral posture), and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] standing “at attention.” After palpation and marking of relevant bony landmarks, the gravity-referenced inclinometer will be zeroed at the 7th cervical to 1st thoracic intervertebral space, and the angle (in degrees) at the 12th thoracic to 1st lumbar intervertebral space will be recorded. Duplicate measures of each posture will be performed, and the average will be used for analysis.</p>
                    <p id="Par103">Tragus-to-wall distance, a measure of forward head posture, will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using an anthropometric ruler with the head in a natural position. The participant will be positioned in standing unshod with their feet shoulder-width apart, knees extended, with buttocks and back against the wall, and arms hanging relaxed by their sides. Horizontal distance (cm) from the anterior edge of the right tragus to the wall will be determined in duplicate, and the mean of the two attempts recorded.</p>

                    <p id="Par105">Bilateral proximal femur DXA scans (Medix DR, Medilink, Mauguio, France) will be conducted and analyzed using 3D Hip analysis software (DMS Group, Mauguio, France) to estimate trabecular and cortical bone mass and geometric parameters. The coefficient of variation for 3D Hip outcomes at the TH and FN in our laboratory range from 0.83 to 2.71%.</p>
                    <p id="Par106">Calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS; Achilles EXPII, GE Healthcare, Wisconsin, USA) of the functionally non-dominant limb will be performed to obtain bone strength parameters including broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA; dB/MHz), speed of sound (SOS; m/s), and stiffness index (SI; %). We have previously observed that the skeletally non-dominant (lowest BUA) calcaneus corresponds to the functionally non-dominant leg (stance leg when kicking a ball) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The coefficients of variation in our laboratory for BUA, SOS, and SI of the calcaneus in women over the age of 50 years range from 0.41 to 2.19%.</p>
                    <p id="Par107">Bone strength parameters at the 4%, 38%, and 66% sites of the skeletally non-dominant leg and 4% and 66% sites of the skeletally non-dominant forearm (opposite to the hand they write with) will be scanned using pQCT (Stratec XCT-3000, Medizintechnick GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). The distal 4% site for both the leg and forearm will be used to examine predominantly trabecular bone outcomes of the tibia and radius, respectively. The diaphyseal 38% site of the leg and the proximal 66% site of the forearm will be used to examine predominantly cortical bone outcomes of the tibia and radius, respectively. pQCT-derived bone parameters at the distal site will include total content (mg), total volumetric density (mg/cm<sup>3</sup>), total cross-sectional area (mm<sup>2</sup>), trabecular content (mg), trabecular volumetric density (mg/cm<sup>3</sup>), trabecular cross-sectional area (mm<sup>2</sup>), total bone strength index (g<sup>2</sup>/cm<sup>4</sup>), and trabecular bone strength index (g<sup>2</sup>/cm<sup>4</sup>). pQCT-derived bone parameters at the diaphyseal or proximal site will include: cortical content (mg), cortical volumetric density (mg/cm<sup>3</sup>), cortical cross-sectional area (mm<sup>2</sup>), cortical thickness (mm), periosteal circumference (mm), endocortical circumference (mm), polar section modulus (mm<sup>2</sup>), and polar strength strain index (mm<sup>3</sup>). Bone strength index reflects resistance of the bone to compression, and polar strength strain index reflects diaphyseal resistance to bending and torsional bone strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Scan procedures, scan parameters, and details outlining the technical loop analysis using host software (Version 6.20, Stratec, Medizintechnick GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany) have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In our laboratory, the coefficients of variation for pQCT-derived bone outcomes of the tibia range from 0.72 to 2.66% at the distal (4%) site and 0.21 to 1.38% at the diaphyseal (38%) site, and from 0.96 to 5.05% at the distal (4%) site and 0.61 to 3.27% proximal (66%) site for the radius.</p>

Briefly, the participant will rise from a seated position without using their arms for assistance, walk as fast as possible without running a distance of 3 m, pivot at the indicated mark, and return to assume a seated position. The average time of two successful trials will be recorded.</p>
                    <p id="Par111">The five-times sit-to-stand (FTSTS) test examines the ability to rise unassisted from a seated position and is a reliable marker of mobility and lower extremity muscle strength. The recommendations outlined by Bohannon for assessing older adults will be followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The average time of two successful trials will be recorded. Both the TUG and FTSTS tests will be performed using a standard chair (height = 45 cm) without arms.</p>

The countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) will be performed to assess lower extremity muscle power by measuring maximal jump height, without arm swing, on a ground reaction force plate (Leonardo Mechanograph, Novotec Medical GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). Participants will be provided with a description of the task, a demonstration, and one familiarization trial. Outcomes generated by host software (Version 4.4b01.32) for analysis will include maximal relative power during takeoff (W/kg), maximal velocity during takeoff (m/s), jump height (cm), maximal force (kN), relative maximal force (g), and Esslinger Fitness Index (%; comparison with age- and sex-matched reference norms of maximal power normalized to body weight). Technical details and testing procedures for the Leonardo Mechanograph have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and the test-retest reliability in older adults is excellent (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.93) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>

For the FRT, the participant will stand upright with shoulders perpendicular to a wall marked with vertical measurement lines, with the right side closest to the wall, making a fist with the right hand. The right shoulder will be flexed until the right hand is level with shoulder height in front of the body, and the maximal distance (cm) reached by the head of the third metacarpal on the measurement lines will be noted. An instruction will then be given to reach forward as far as possible, by flexing the trunk at hip, but not taking a step forward or losing balance and the distance (cm) reached by the head of the third metacarpal will be measured again. Two FRT trials will be conducted and the maximum difference between the two measured distances will be recorded.</p>
                    <p id="Par115">For the tandem walk test, the participant will be asked to walk heel-to-toe for 6 m along a straight line marked on the floor. They will be instructed to complete the tandem walk as quickly as possible, while making the least number of errors (such as, not touching heel to toe or stepping off the line to recover balance). Two trials will be performed; the trial with the least number of errors will be recorded. In the event that both trials have an equal number of errors, the time of the fastest trial (sec) will be recorded.</p>

These questionnaires were included as pelvic floor disorders (i.e., urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse) are common in community-dwelling older Australian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and there is anecdotal concern that heavy lifting may exacerbate the conditions. The PFDI-20 contains three subscales relating to symptoms of urinary, vaginal and bowel dysfunction, and the degree of bother and distress for women. The PFIQ-7 contains three subscales which assess the impact of pelvic floor disorders on activities, relationships, and feelings. The PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 have been shown to have excellent test-retest reliability in older women (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.93 and 0.77, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

                <p id="Par130">A number of lifestyle behaviors have the potential to influence bone outcomes, including diet and habitual physical activity and therefore may need to be adjusted for in the data analyses. Validated questionnaires will be used to determine average daily calcium consumption and historical bone-relevant physical activity.</p>
                <p id="Par131">Average daily calcium intake (mg/day) including supplementation will be assessed using the AusCal, a calcium-focused questionnaire designed for the Australia diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Questionnaire responses will be scored using FoodWorks analysis software (Version 7, Xyris Software, Brisbane, Australia).</p>
                <p id="Par132">Bone-relevant lifetime and current physical activity participation scores will be derived using the Bone-specific Physical Activity Questionnaire (BPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], using a custom-designed online analysis program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fithdysign.com/BPAQ/">www.fithdysign.com/BPAQ/</ext-link>). Participants will record all regular, structured physical activity, and the years of participation from which current (cBPAQ, i.e., previous 12-month period) and total (tBPAQ) scores will be calculated from algorithms that rank and weight activities based on loading rates and magnitudes.</p>
                <p id="Par133">Demographic and health data related to risk of fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] will be collected at baseline, including ethnicity, smoking status (current, past, or never), alcohol consumption (average daily and weekly consumption), previous history of falls and low-trauma fractures, and parental history of hip fracture.</p>

                <p id="Par134">Management, storage, and retention of study data will be in line with Griffith University Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research. Data will be de-identified using unique coded IDs for each participant. Relevant study personnel will be trained in the use of the study database and assigned password access by the Primary Investigator for the purposes of data entry. All study-related documents and records will be retained securely for a minimum of 15 years after trial completion in a locked filing cabinet and on a password-protected hard drive within a secured office at Griffith University. De-identified data may be made available for the purposes of meta-analyses or other collaborations on a case-by-case basis; participant confidentiality will always be maintained. The usual scientific reporting practices will occur in order to disseminate trial results, for example scientific presentations and publication of papers in peer-reviewed discipline-specific journals. There will be no interim analyses published prior to completion of the VIBMOR trial.</p>

                <p id="Par135">The biostatistician responsible for data analyses will be blind to group allocation and have no contact with participants at any stage of the trial. The Primary Investigator will have some contact with participants (e.g., at morning teas and consulting on screening and data collection queries) but be blind to group allocation. The clinical trial coordinator and other research assistants will be blind to group allocation until after baseline testing when randomization will occur and thereafter will be aware of group allocations. Participants will be blind to group allocation until after baseline testing. Although they will naturally be aware of allocation to their respective group (that is, LIV, HiRIT, LIV plus HiRIT, or home-based exercise [referred to herein as control]), they will remain blinded to the study hypotheses. That is, the group activity hypothesized to be most efficacious will not be revealed to participants.</p>

At 9 months, separate analyses of the two primary hypotheses (LIV with and without HiRIT) will be performed. To compare proportions of participants maintaining TH aBMD across treatment groups in both primary and secondary hypotheses, logistic regression models will be used, with adjustments for age, baseline values, BMI, bone-relevant physical activity, calcium consumption, and serum 25(OH)D. Repeated measures comparisons of mean change in TH aBMD and secondary outcomes will also be conducted using univariate analyses, controlling for initial values, calcium, serum 25(OH)D, and compliance. Separate per protocol analyses based on adherence to exercise and LIV will be conducted using treatment log diaries and information obtained during study visits. The change in quality of life scores over time will be compared between study groups using appropriate parametric and non-parametric techniques. Further exploratory analyses will include examination of secondary hypotheses and possible associations of osteoporosis medications, as well as anthropometric and compliance factors, on treatment effects. Repeat analyses of the 21-month data will be conducted to examine whether any treatment effects have been maintained.</p>

                <title>Roles and responsibilities</title>
                <p id="Par137">The coordinating center will be the Bone Densitometry Research Laboratory in the Menzies Health Institute, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, where all face-to-face trial activities will be conducted. Responsibility for all aspects of trial conduct and local organization will be overseen and monitored by the primary investigator (BRB) with contributions from co-investigators (CTR, SKP, and MF) as required. Implementation of the trial protocol will be the responsibility of the clinical trial coordinator (ATH), with appropriate delegation to research assistants. No additional trial steering committee, endpoint adjudication committee, or Data Monitoring Committee was deemed necessary for reasons described below. Regular meetings of the clinical trial coordinator, research assistants, and primary investigator (BRB) will be held to review protocol adherence and safety reports. Research staff will be responsible for identifying potential recruitment channels (as outlined in the “Recruitment” section of the “Methods”), contacting potential participants to conduct the preliminary screening, and obtaining informed consent prior to baseline DXA screening and testing.</p>
                <p id="Par138">Only one mild adverse event was reported during the LIFTMOR trial (Protocol number AHS/07/14/HREC, ANZCTR trial number 12616000475448) that examined the identical HiRIT protocol in participants with identical eligibility criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], providing evidence of a very low-risk intervention. The VIBMOR trial was therefore also deemed “low risk” by the approving HREC, and early termination was considered exceedingly unlikely. For this reason, stopping guidelines and a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) were determined to be unnecessary. Instead, in accordance with the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, and the University Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research, any adverse events that occur during the trial period that are possibly, likely, or certainly related to procedures/interventions will be reported to the HREC within 24 h for the consideration of the Chair. Further, any reported adverse events will be reviewed and adjudicated at the Griffith University HREC meeting held monthly. Compulsory annual progress reports will also be made to the HREC which include reporting of adverse events. The Griffith University HREC is a registered institution with the National Health and Medical Research Council (Registration number EC00162). No supplementary auditing for the trial was deemed necessary.</p>
                <p id="Par139">We do not anticipate that there will be any further protocol amendments to the VIBMOR trial; however, in the unlikely event that amendments are required, any variations will be submitted for approval by the Griffith University HREC and the funding body as required. Modifications will be updated on the ANZCTR clinical trials registry by the primary investigator (BRB).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par140">To our knowledge, VIBMOR will be the first trial to examine the efficacy of LIV alone or in combination with a bone-targeted HiRIT program on determinants of hip fracture in postmenopausal women with low to very low bone mass. The overarching aim of the VIBMOR trial is to compare the effects of two non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies alone and combined, having previously only been applied in isolation. Pharmacotherapy is the currently accepted primary therapy for the prevention of osteoporotic fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, osteoporosis medications are not universally effective or broadly adopted, nor do they reduce falls in older women, despite falls being strongly associated with fragility fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. A therapy that both builds bone and reduces falls would be a valuable step forward in the prevention of osteoporotic fracture, with associated morbidity and mortality benefits.</p>
              <p id="Par141">Low-intensity whole-body vibration (LIV; 30 Hz at 0.3 to 0.4<italic>g</italic>) has been shown to stimulate meaningful bone benefits in children with clinical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and adults with low BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, systematic reviews and meta-analyses report inconsistent effects of vibration on bone mass and strength specifically in postmenopausal women. Some report osteogenic effects, mainly at the LS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. A more recent review reports no overall effect on aBMD or bone microarchitecture, but a potential effect on falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The variability of outcomes reported in previous WBV reviews may be due to methodological shortcomings of some included trials. Those include inadequate sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], confounding simultaneous interventions (e.g., osteoporosis medications or vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], lack of control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], inadequate blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], and/or insufficient trial duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Authors of reviews agree that large-scale randomized controlled trials of adequate duration are needed before recommendations can be made for the use of vibration as adjuvant osteoporosis therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Trials examining bone mass and strength outcomes have compared WBV to very low-intensity aerobic activities unlikely to be osteogenic (walking) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], to sham WBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], or compared non-equivalent WBV stimuli (e.g., high- versus low-intensity WBV therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]), in community-dwelling postmenopausal women. Few studies have examined the synergist effect of vibration and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], or directly compared WBV with exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] in postmenopausal women, using appropriately robust randomized controlled trial design.</p>
              <p id="Par142">In a 6-month randomized controlled pilot trial of thrice-weekly WBV versus thrice-weekly resistance training (machine-based leg extension and leg press exercises) or control (habitual activity) for postmenopausal women, only WBV increased TH aBMD (0.93%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The WBV group, however, was contaminated by the addition of static and dynamic knee extensor exercises during the vibration stimulus and the vibration protocol changed across the trial period (session duration, amplitude [from 1.7 mm to 2.5 mm], and/or frequency [from 35 to 40 Hz] were all increased) limiting the ability to identify the effective therapeutic protocol. Furthermore, the resistance training intensity in the exercise group ranged from only low intensity (20 repetition maximum) to moderate intensity (eight repetition maximum) which may have limited its osteogenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par143">In the “Erlangen Longitudinal Vibration Study,” no difference in effect in LS aBMD was observed after 18 months of 25–35 Hz, amplitude 1.7 mm WBV plus exercise versus exercise alone (1.5 ± 2.3% versus 2.1 ± 3.0%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. As previously discussed, the low-moderate-intensity nature of the exercise group was likely an insufficient stimulus for notable bone adaptation. Although there was no change detected in TH aBMD for either group, and findings did not support an additive effect for WBV plus exercise on bone mass, a promising reduction in fall incidence across the trial period for WBV plus exercise was observed in comparison to control (a wellness-focused program). As a vibration displacement of 1.7 mm at 30 Hz produces a stimulus intensity of 6.1 <italic>g</italic>, neither of the latter vibration protocols may be safe for an osteoporotic demographic.</p>
              <p id="Par144">Current exercise prescription recommendations support the notion that exercise should be performed to ameliorate age-related loss of bone mass in healthy older adults; however, there is disparity in the specifics of the recommendations. The “Too Fit to Fracture” exercise recommendations for individuals with reduced bone mass or osteoporotic vertebral fractures advocate only moderate-intensity progressive resistance training in combination with high challenge balance exercises and aerobic exercise for general health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The “Exercise &amp; Sports Science Australia” position statement on exercise prescription for osteoporosis suggests impact-loading exercises, moderate-high-intensity progressive resistance training, and challenging balance activities to reduce fall and fracture susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Findings of past meta-analyses have suggested resistance training, or a combination of resistance training and impact-type activities result in positive, albeit modest, effects on aBMD at clinically relevant sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. A recent very comprehensive systematic review revealed that most studies investigating the effects of exercise intervention on bone mass have applied insufficient loading to be osteogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of 53 randomized controlled trials in healthy postmenopausal women that parsed out the effect of exercise intensity on aBMD reported that high-intensity exercise improved LS aBMD more than low or moderate-intensity exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A dearth of trials (only 3) testing high-intensity exercise may have limited the ability to detect a similar effect at the proximal femur.</p>
              <p id="Par145">Previously, it was thought that individuals with low bone mass could not tolerate high magnitudes and rates of loading on account of their weakened skeleton. This assumption was discredited by findings of the LIFTMOR and LIFTMOR-M intervention trials that reported improvements in LS and FN aBMD, functional performance, muscle strength, balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and thoracic kyphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with no fragility fractures at any skeletal site during the intervention period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These trials showed that, given adequate supervision, and a familiarization period, HiRIT is safe, well tolerated, and feasible for individuals at increased risk of fragility fracture. Moreover, there has been concern among the research community that high-intensity resistance training may worsen symptoms of pelvic floor disorders or lead to pelvic floor dysfunction in older women; however, recent findings from an Australian cross-sectional study do not support this notion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. It was reported that women aged 18 to 88 years who lifted heavy weights for exercise did not have an increased prevalence of symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, but rather those who were inactive or lifted <italic>lighter</italic> weights for exercise presented with an increase in pelvic floor organ prolapse symptoms.</p>
              <p id="Par146">The promising results from LIV and HiRIT trials suggest there is reason for optimism that non-pharmacological therapies may be legitimate options for reducing falls and fragility fractures in older adults with low bone mass. To date the synergistic effect of LIV with HiRIT has never been tested, nor has there been a direct comparison of efficacy between LIV and HiRIT for reducing risk of osteoporotic fracture. The VIBMOR trial will not only examine these important research questions, but include both women who are on or off osteoporosis medications, and women with low to very low bone mass, populations who have traditionally been excluded from intervention trials testing non-pharmacological osteoporosis therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec25">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par147">Several limitations warrant discussion. First, the VIBMOR trial will not be powered to detect differences in falls and fracture incidence between the four trial arms. Second, for reasons of participant retention, we elected to adopt a positive control condition (home-based low-intensity exercise program) such that the control arm of the trial will not be entirely exercise naïve. When volunteering under the expectation of receiving therapy for osteoporosis, arguably there are ethical issues around withholding all forms of potentially beneficial therapy from individuals at risk of fragility fracture. While the home-based exercise program is not expected to provide a stimulus for bone it may provide some protection from falls. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged the control group intervention also differs from the HiRIT intervention in terms of weekly face-to-face contact with investigators. We will address this with frequent electronic contact and morning tea meetings. Third, our sample will be limited to apparently healthy, ambulatory, community-dwelling postmenopausal women with low to very low bone mass. These inclusion criteria will limit generalizability of results to men and women who may be even more frail and therefore even more in need of therapy designed to prevent osteoporotic fracture.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par148">The growing worldwide burden of osteoporotic fracture and lack of appetite of patients for osteoporosis medications demands that effective non-pharmacological therapies to prevent osteoporotic fractures are identified. The proposed study seeks to establish the efficacy of LIV alone and in combination with HiRIT, as two such therapies. A comprehensive suite of secondary and exploratory outcome measures will inform other benefits of either intervention such as body composition, posture, functional performance, and numerous indices of quality of life. An economic evaluation will add vital information as to the feasibility of the therapies as legitimate public health interventions.</p>

              <title>Funding</title>
              <p>The VIBMOR trial was funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC, Canberra, ACT, Australia) Project Grant Scheme 2015–2018 (Grant number: 1084376, “Whole body vibration for osteoporosis: Shaking up our treatment options,” CIA Belinda R Beck, 2015-18). The NHMRC has no role in the design of the trial and will not have any role during its execution, management, analyses, or interpretation of results. All trial activities will be entirely independent from these funding bodies. Similarly, the design, management, analysis, and reporting of data are entirely independent of the manufacturer (BTT Health GmbH, Inning am Ammersee, Germany) and distributor (RehaCare Pty Ltd, Cherrybrook, NSW, Australia) of the Marodyne LivMD LIV device. Public Liability Insurance is obtained from Griffith University and incorporates coverage for personal injury in respect to clinical trials.
