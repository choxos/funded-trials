                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>The purpose of this research was to develop, implement, and test the efficacy of a theory-driven, evidence-informed peer leadership program for elementary school students (Grade 6 and 7; age 11–12 years) and the Grade 3/4 students with whom they were partnered. The primary outcome was teacher ratings of their Grade 6/7 students’ transformational leadership behaviors. Secondary outcomes included: Grade 6/7 students’ leadership self-efficacy, as well as Grade 3/4 motivation, perceived competence, general self-concept, fundamental movement skills, school-day physical activity, and program adherence, and program evaluation.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. In 2019, 6 schools comprising 7 teachers, 132 leaders, and 227 grade 3 and 4 students were randomly allocated to the intervention or waitlist control conditions. Intervention teachers took part in a half-day workshop (January 2019), delivered 7 x 40 minute lessons to Grade 6/7 peer leaders (February and March 2019), and these peer leaders subsequently ran a ten-week physical literacy development program for Grade 3/4 students (2x30 minutes sessions per week). Waitlist-control students followed their usual routines. Assessments were conducted at baseline (January 2019) and immediately post-intervention (June 2019).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The intervention had no significant effect on teacher ratings of their students’ transformational leadership (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = 0.201, p = .272) after controlling for baseline and gender. There was no significant condition effect for Grade 6/7 student rated transformation leadership (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = 0.077, p = .569) or leadership self-efficacy (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = 3.747, p = .186) while controlling for baseline and gender. There were null findings for all outcomes related to Grade 3 and 4 students.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>Adaptions to the delivery mechanism were not effective in increasing leadership skills of older students or components of physical literacy in younger Grade 3/4 students. However, teacher self-reported adherence to the intervention delivery was high.</p>

              <p>Schools have been identified as ideal settings to promote various life skills and health behaviors in children and youth [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Within elementary schools, there are both opportunities and curriculum requirements to schedule time during the school week to teach relevant life skills and health behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One important life skill that represents a viable target for intervention is <italic toggle="yes">leadership</italic>. Broadly conceived, leadership is concerned with the behavioral processes through which one person influences a group of others toward attaining a specific set of goals or objectives [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Effective displays of leadership, by children, have the potential to affect the learning climate within the class context, other facets of school life (e.g., sports, extra-curricular activities), and potentially beyond (e.g., early adulthood). In spite of the importance of developing leadership among children, there is a distinct paucity of theory-driven and/or evidence informed physical activity leadership interventions/programs designed to develop leadership [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although many leadership frameworks exist, transformational leadership theory [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has been the most widely used across various settings, including schools. Transformational leadership is conceptualized as involving the demonstration of behaviors that empower and inspire others, transcend one’s own self-interests, and give others the confidence to achieve higher levels of functioning [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Transformational leadership involves four conceptually distinct, but related, dimensions: (a) idealized influence (fosters trust and respect, acts as a role model), (b) inspirational motivation (displays optimism, enthusiasm, and communicates high expectations of others), (c) intellectual stimulation (encourages others to see issues from multiple perspectives), and (d) individualized consideration (recognizes and acts on the psychological and physical needs of others) [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a range of life contexts (e.g., sport, business, education), observational studies shown positive associations between displays of transformational leadership and follower motivation [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], self-efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], wellbeing [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and engagement [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>A recent review of peer-delivered interventions that sought to promote physical activity behaviors revealed a distinct absence of studies that sought to assess the behaviors of peer-leaders (i.e., leadership behaviors) that were targeted within the respective interventions [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, the only study in this review that assessed both leadership behaviors among peer leaders, as well as the physical activity behaviors of those being led was the Australian GLASS trial (i.e., pilot study for the current randomized controlled trial) [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Specifically, the Great Leaders Active StudentS (GLASS) non-randomized trial sought to develop the transformational leadership skills of older students (Grade 6 <italic toggle="yes">peer-leaders</italic>; 11–12 years of age) and increase physical activity levels and fundamental movement skill (FMS) competency among younger students in Kindergarten, Grade 1 and Grade 2 [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This 10-week, peer-leadership intervention was directly informed by tenets of transformational leadership theory [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and previous movement skill interventions [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It was developed to enhance the leadership behaviors of elementary school children, who were subsequently tasked with developing younger children’s FMS competency [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. FMS represent the building blocks required for children and youth to engage in lifelong health-enhancing physical activities [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and represent a key behavioral component of <italic toggle="yes">physical literacy</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Physical literacy is defined as “motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge, and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities for life” [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Physical literacy thus takes a more holistic perspective in understanding the attributes that contribute to one’s capability to be physically active across the lifespan. Multiple interventions have focused on individual components of physical literacy from a physical, psychological, or social perspective [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, targeting multiple components of physical literacy within a single intervention may be more advantageous, as it will help elucidate those factor(s) that best assist an individual in being physically active. For example, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of physical literacy interventions demonstrated that there were significant treatment effects for interventions when all physical literacy outcomes were combined [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Yet, these results are more nuanced with interventions exerting differential effects on the varying outcome categories. This same review describes that there appears to be the strongest evidence for improving physical competence, while psychological outcomes (e.g., motivation, confidence) are harder to improve through interventions [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>Findings from this systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] align with findings from our team’s previous GLASS pilot trial. Indeed, our previous pilot intervention resulted in large effects for teacher rated leadership effectiveness among Grade 6 students (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 1.09) as well as the object control movement skill competency of younger students (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.95) [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The study did not result in a statistically significant difference in terms of school day physical activity (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.29; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.313). However, this pilot study was not without its limitations. Specifically, the GLASS trial used a non-randomized study design, was only implemented in one school, used pedometers as a measure of physical activity, and was implemented with the youngest children in primary school (i.e., Kindergarden, Grade 1 and 2). Further, the intervention delivery was very labor intensive. Leadership development training was delivered directly by a researcher to the peer-leaders. Additional resources including providing peer leaders with equipment packs to use during their lessons, FMS training, a one-hour booster training midway through the intervention, as well as handbooks and lesson plans, and three weeks where observations and feedback were provided on their teaching were also provided by the researchers in this study. Ultimately, larger scale studies are needed that involve a more scalable delivery model. To build upon past success in the GLASS trial [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the current trial tested the efficacy of a <italic toggle="yes">Peer Leadership for Physical Literacy</italic> (PLPL) intervention. The key goal of the PLPL intervention was to develop both leadership behaviors (primary outcome) and components of physical literacy (secondary outcomes) among students in Canadian elementary schools. We used a cluster randomized controlled trial design with an expanded number of schools and a different delivery mechanism. In the current trial, adaptations were made to enhance the potential scalability of the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] by ensuring intervention components or implementation strategies were less resource intensive. Thus, teachers were provided with the necessary training and curriculum resources to deliver the leadership training/education intervention directly to peer leaders. If efficacious, this approach would lend itself to broader intervention delivery and reach [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

                <title>Aims and hypotheses</title>
                <p>The aims of this study were to develop, implement, and test the efficacy of a theory-driven, scalable, evidence-based peer leadership program for elementary school students (Grade 6/7; age 11–12 years) in relation to (a) their own leadership skills (primary outcome) and their leadership self-efficacy (i.e., confidence to lead; secondary outcome), as well as (b) components of physical literacy of younger (Grade 3/4; age 8–9 years) students with whom they were partnered for 10 weeks (secondary outcomes). We hypothesized that the intervention would result in greater use of peer leadership behaviors by Grade 6/7 students as rated by their teacher, compared to control peers (primary research question). As secondary research questions, we also hypothesized that the intervention would result in higher levels of peer leaders’ confidence to lead, and as well as increases in outcomes related to components of physical literacy in Grade 3/4 students’ when compared to control students.</p>

                <p>The PLPL intervention was evaluated using a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial.</p>
                <p>The study was approved by the Behavioural Research Ethics Board at The University of British Columbia (H18-00141), with School Board approval also obtained from four School Boards/Districts in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. Prior to enrollment in the study, informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians and teachers, as well as signed assent from all children. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT03783767; Registered December 21, 2018). The design, conduct, and reporting of the study adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension for cluster randomized controlled trials [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (See <xref rid="pone.0280261.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (See <xref rid="pone.0280261.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> for SPIRIT diagram), and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist (See <xref rid="pone.0280261.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

                <p>To effectively manage the study, the trial was designed to run in two cohorts, with the first cohort taking place between January and June 2019, and the second cohort running between January and June 2020 (see <xref rid="pone.0280261.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In each cohort, baseline measures were collected in January, after which schools were randomized to either intervention or wait-list control conditions. Teachers of Grade 6/7 students in the intervention condition received training and curriculum resources (February) to deliver a leadership development module to Grade 6/7 students (hereafter referred to as peer leaders). From April to June peer leaders delivered a 10-week movement skills program to their younger Grade 3/4 counterparts. Post-test measures occurred at the end of the 10-week program (June) for both intervention and wait-list control participants who engaged in the ‘usual practice’ curriculum.</p>

                <title>Changes to trial design</title>
                <p>In March of 2020 study recruitment was terminated early. While the PLPL trial was originally designed to run in two cohorts, shutdowns due to COVID-19 necessitated an early termination of recruitment. Prior to this shutdown, we were able to fully complete Cohort 1 of this study in 2019. Thus, this manuscript reflects only data from Cohort 1. We did not collect data from the second cohort once restrictions were eased due to the length of time the study had been paused and the substantive changes in physical activity due to COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] that potentially rendered a second cohort incomparable.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Elementary schools within four school districts in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada were invited to participate in this project. Recruitment for Cohort 1 took place between September and December 2018. All principals at eligible schools (public schools within the four districts for which district approval was obtained) were contacted by email for initial interest in the study. Following an expression of interest from a principal, a meeting with the principal and eligible teachers was conducted. After the meeting, schools determined whether they wanted to participate, and which classes would be involved. Schools were asked to provide at least one class of older students (Grade 6/7; ages 12–13), as well as up to three classes of younger students (ages 8–10). Grade 7 represents the last year of elementary school in the target school districts. Split grade classes are common thus the class of older students could have been all Grade 7 students or both Grade 6 and 7 students. For younger students, classes were also split, but only Grade 3 and 4 students took part in the study (enrolled in all Grade 4, 3/4 or 4/5 split classes). The only exclusion criterion at the student level was a basic working knowledge of English. Active parental consent, as well as child assent, were obtained before enrollment in the study.</p>

                <p>After baseline assessments (January 2019) schools were randomized (by a researcher not involved in the current study using a computer-based, random number generator) with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to either intervention or waitlist-control conditions. School allocation to the intervention or control group (i.e., usual care) was blinded to all data collectors (aside from the project manager responsible for correct delivery of intervention materials). Schools allocated to the wait-list control group received the PLPL program in full during the following academic year (Fall 2019), but did not contribute data to the trial when receiving the PLPL program. Notification of group allocation to either group was completed by the project manager via email.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The PLPL trial was implemented in two phases. The first phase involved the development of leadership among Grade 6/7 peer leaders; referred to as the ‘Peer-Leadership Development Program’ section of the intervention. The second phase involved the Grade 6/7 peer leaders delivering a 10-week movement skills program to the younger Grade 3/4 students; referred to as the ‘Physical Literacy Development Program’ of the overall intervention. Both sections drew directly from our previous work [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], as well as previous intervention work within school settings that involved a train-the-teacher delivery model [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Two key changes were made to the current trial compared to our pilot study. First, the target age group of younger students was different, shifting from Kindergarten, Grade 1 and 2 in our previous non-randomized trial to Grade 3 and 4 students in this efficacy trial. Secondly, previously where a research team delivered all content to peer leaders, a train-the-trainer approach was adopted and the research team delivered all content to Grade 6/7 teachers through a half-day workshop at the last author’s university. These teachers then delivered the content to their students. This change in delivery mechanism was designed with intervention scalability and sustainability foregrounded. Specifically, having teachers deliver programs within their own classes are more likely to be sustained and delivered at scale compared to an external research team that would be required to deliver a program across multiple schools on an ongoing basis.</p>
                <p>As an incentive for participation, schools (in both intervention and wait-list control conditions) were provided with an assortment of developmentally appropriate sports equipment (e.g., basketballs, soccer balls, baseball batting tees, cones, beanbags) to be used during the movement skills program. The value of these equipment packs was approximately $250 each. Schools retained this equipment after the study. For participation at the individual student level, all peer leaders who completed questionnaires and Grade 3/4 students who completed questionnaires and movement skill measures (described below) at baseline and post-test received $10. Grade 3/4 students who also completed accelerometry measures at both time points received an additional $20.</p>

                <title>Peer-leadership development program (intervention part I)</title>
                <p>The Peer-Leadership Development Program (see <xref rid="pone.0280261.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>) is guided by the conceptual framework initially developed by Kelloway and Barling [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and extended by Beauchamp and Morton [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This framework involves (a) presentation of transformational leadership behavioral principles, (b) demonstration of what those behaviors look like in practice, using real-world examples, (c) providing opportunities to practice those behaviors, (d) receiving feedback on the implementation of those strategies, and (e) development of self-regulatory strategies to support sustained implementation [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The program was delivered in age-appropriate terms [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We refer to the four dimensions of transformational leadership as ‘role modelling’ (idealized influence), ‘motivating others’ (inspirational motivation), ‘considering others’ (individualized consideration), and ‘helping students to think’ (intellectual stimulation). At the end of the peer-leadership development module, peer leaders introduced themselves to their allotted Grade 3/4 students.</p>
                <p>One month after baseline measures were collected, Grade 6/7 teachers from the intervention schools attended a half-day workshop (4 hours) in which teachers were provided with the curriculum materials, resources, and lesson plans to be subsequently delivered to their students (see <xref rid="pone.0280261.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). In the workshop, an intervention facilitator (MB; who has 10 years of school-based intervention experience) introduced and explained all curriculum materials to teachers. Teachers were encouraged to discuss and work through any challenges with curriculum delivery. Teachers were provided with a manual to facilitate (a) the delivery of the peer-leadership development program, and (b) peer leaders’ subsequent delivery of the 10-week movement skills program. At the end of the workshop, teachers worked with the intervention facilitator to schedule the delivery of the in-school, peer-leadership program.</p>
                <p>Following the workshop, teachers delivered four 40-minute lessons on leadership over a 6-week period (classes 1–4; see <xref rid="pone.0280261.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>), followed by an experiential component (classes 5–7; see <xref rid="pone.0280261.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). The four 40-minute lessons (i.e., classes 1–4) were designed to explain (a) what exceptional leadership looks like (i.e., the behaviors and attributes of great leaders), (b) the benefits of movement skills, (c) the key teaching points used to explain each key movement skill incorporated in this program, and (d) how peer leaders will use their leadership skills to deliver a 10-week movement skills program to Grade 3/4 students. In the experiential component (i.e., classes 5–7), Grade 6/7 peer leaders practiced delivering aspects of the movement skills program (3 X 40 min classes) to each other and received feedback from each other and their teacher, before they delivered the 10-week movement skills program to the Grade 3/4 students (see Intervention Part II below). If teachers felt that students needed additional classes to practice their teaching before implementing the 10-week program, they were able to add practice classes as needed.</p>

                <title>Physical literacy development program (intervention part II)</title>
                <p>The Grade 6/7 peer leaders delivered two 30-minute movement skill sessions per week for 10-weeks, at a convenient time for the schools (e.g., beginning of school, lunch, during younger students’ physical education classes). To provide further flexibility, lessons could occur in a gymnasium or on an outdoor sports field. The 10-week program provided a maximum of 600 minutes of program delivery to younger students. Within intervention schools, a class of peer leaders (~25–30 students) was divided into three groups. Thus, between 6–9 peer leaders were allocated to deliver movement skills sessions with one entire younger class (~20–25 students) for the duration of the 10-week movement skills program. Peer leaders remained with the same class throughout the 10-week period. Peer leaders worked in pairs to teach one section of each class (i.e., warm-up, demonstrate the movement skill, skill practice, and set-up and oversee the game). Thus, 2–3 leaders would be responsible for teaching the warm-up, then a different 2–3 leaders would teach skill practice, and then a different 2–3 leaders would teach the game. While lesson components were being completed all leaders were able to provide feedback to younger students as necessary. At the beginning of each week, peer leaders planned their respective lessons for which they were responsible. In addition to displaying leadership by teaching specific sections of the movement skills sessions, all peer leaders were encouraged to display effective leadership (e.g., act as effective role models) by taking part in the activities and games along with the Grade 3 and 4 students they taught.</p>
                <p>Each movement skill session focused on one of six object control skills (i.e., catching, overhand throwing, underhand throwing, kicking, dribbling, and a two-handed strike (with a baseball bat)). Each of these skills was taught between three (catch, overarm throw, two-handed strike, dribble) and four times (underarm throw, kick) throughout the duration of the 10-week program. While specific key teaching points were provided for all skills, as well as games that incorporated these skills, the leaders had the freedom to plan their lessons based on their own experiences. That is, a general lesson/structure was provided by the research team, but leaders could design the specific session plan.</p>
                <p>To further support the intervention schools in administering the movement skill program to Grade 3/4 students, during the first three weeks of the program, peer leaders were observed by trained research assistants and provided with feedback with regard to (a) the core components of each class (i.e., warm-up, skill development, skill application, and closure), and (b) their leadership behaviors over the course of the class based on the four dimensions of transformational leadership described above.</p>

                <p><italic toggle="yes">Teacher-rated transformational leadership</italic>: The leadership behaviors of Grade 6/7 peer leaders were assessed by their teacher using an adapted version of the Transformational Teaching Questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Teachers were asked to rate the behaviors of each peer leader within their respective Grade 6/7 class with a four-item measure that assessed students’ displays of individualized consideration, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and idealized influence. Responses were provided on a five-point scale anchored from 0 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Frequently”), with “The peer leader that I’m rating …” provided as the stem. Exemplar items include “Behaves as someone that other students can trust” (idealized influence) and “Is enthusiastic about what other students are capable of achieving” (inspirational motivation). Scores derived from this abbreviated measure of the Transformational Teaching Questionnaire displayed good internal consistency (α ≥ 0.92–0.93; See <xref rid="pone.0280261.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) in the current sample.

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Leadership self-efficacy</italic>: Peer leaders’ leadership self-efficacy was assessed using an 11-item measure based on standard protocols for assessing self-efficacy beliefs [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], by asking them “how confident are you that you can…” perform the key leadership behaviors being targeted in the intervention. Responses to items were provided on a 0–100 scale (at 10-point increments) anchored by 0% (“no confidence”), 50% (“somewhat confident”), and 100% (“completely confident”). To ensure conceptual congruence between the target (leadership) behavior [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and the efficacy beliefs being assessed, items from the Transformational Teaching Questionnaire were adapted to assess peer-leaders’ confidence to display the relevant transformational leadership behaviors (e.g., “…behave as someone that other students can trust”). Items were also adapted from a previous questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with exemplar items including “…be a role model to other students”, “…teach physical activity skills to other students”, “…help students feel safe about joining in”. As per recent recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the prefix “If you really wanted to” was placed before “how confident are you that you can…” in order to hold motivation constant and derive more precise measures of self-efficacy. Measures derived from this instrument were found to display acceptable internal consistency (α ≥ 0.93) in our sample.

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Self-determined motivation</italic>: Motivation for being physically active among Grade 3/4 students was assessed using the intrinsic motivation measure developed by Sebire and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for specific use with children aged 7–11 years in school physical education settings. Each item begins with the stem “I am active because…”. Example items include: “being active is fun”, “I like being active”, and “it is important to me to do active things”. This six-item questionnaire was rated by students on a scale anchored from one (not true for me) to five (very true for me). Scores derived from this instrument have been found to display sound reliability (α ≥ 0.86–0.89; See <xref rid="pone.0280261.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>) in the current sample, as well as factorial validity in relation to the other motivation regulations subsumed within Self-Determination Theory [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Perceived competence</italic>: Perceived competence was assessed through a five-item subscale previously developed by Sebire and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The original scale asked questions about perceived competence specifically in physical education. However, these questions were adapted to reflect a broader focus of perceived competence as it relates to active games, playing outside, and participating in sports. Example items include: “When it comes to playing active games, I think I am pretty good”, “I think I do well compared to other children”, and “After working at a new activity for a while, I feel that I can do it pretty well”. Each item was rated on a scale that was anchored from 1 (not like me at all) to 5 (really like me). Scores derived from this measure demonstrated sound reliability (α ≥ 0.84–0.87) in the current sample. See <xref rid="pone.0280261.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Self-concept</italic>: Self-concept among Grade 3/4 students was assessed using select subscales (coordination, activity, sport, global physical, and global esteem; 20 items) derived from the Physical Self-Description Questionnaire-Short Version [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Students were asked to rate how correct a statement is about them. Exemplar items included: “I feel confident when doing coordinated movements” (coordination), “I do physically active things at least three times a week” (activity), “I have good sports skills” (sport), “Physically, I feel good about myself” (global physical), and “Overall, I have a lot to be proud of” (global esteem). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (false) to 5 (true). Scores derived from the Physical Self-Description Questionnaire-Short Version were found to display sound internal consistency (α ≥ 0.93–0.95) in our sample. See <xref rid="pone.0280261.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>. Previous work has supported the factorial validity (e.g., comparative fit index = 0.97) and predictive utility of results obtained from this measure [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">FMS</italic>: Three FMS (throw, kick, catch) were assessed as a measure of object control skill competence. Process scores for kicking and throwing were assessed using criteria from the Test of Gross Motor Development-3<sup>rd</sup> edition [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Process scores for catching were not recorded, as catching was completed in a dual-task format making it inappropriate to use criteria from the Test of Gross Motor Development-3<sup>rd</sup> edition. Scores derived from these measures have shown adequate factorial validity (i.e., one factor model for FMS competence; (χ2 (65) = 327.61, p &lt; .001, comparative fit index = .95, Tucker-Lewis index = .94, root mean square error of approximation = .10) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95–0.97) [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Participants were filmed from the side and rear-view using iPads. Skill demonstrations were not provided, but practice attempts were allowed. Two research assistants, blinded to group allocation (e.g., intervention, control) completed all coding of throwing and kicking process scores. Each research assistant was provided with one hour of training by the project coordinator (who has 10+ years experience of motor skill assessment research). This training included explanation of skill criteria and practice coding. Prior to the beginning of formalized coding, both research assistants coded a unique set of 10% of all kicking and throwing videos with no overlap between coders. Research assistants had to obtain ≥ 90% agreement at the component level for both skills with the project coordinator, which was achieved.</p>
                  <p>Product scores were also assessed for kicking (maximal speed) [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], overhand throwing (maximal speed) [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and catching (number of successful catches; [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). Throw and kick speed were completed by asking participants to throw or kick a ball as hard as they could at a wall 20 feet away. Speed was measured using a Stalker Pro II radar gun. The capability to assess skills using product and process scores provides a more holistic understanding of one’s level of competence and has shown moderate to strong agreement with process scores in pediatric populations [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

The dual throw-catch task required a participant to stand behind a line (approximately three times their height) away from a wall. Upon being instructed to start the task, each participant was to take a tennis ball and throw it at a blank wall (using any throw pattern they wanted) and then try to catch the ball (on the bounce or out of the air; could not trap against body) while remaining behind the line. Participants were free to move about the area as much as they wanted. The only place they could not go was in front of their designated line. If the thrown ball did not come back across the participant’s line or went too far away, the participant was to run to a basket of tennis balls (6 feet away from the participant) and obtain another tennis ball and continue the task. This sequence of events was repeated as many times as possible in 30 seconds with the number of catches recorded as the final result. Throwing while performed in this task was not assessed in any way. The catching task had two trials (30 seconds each) with the best result of the two trials (most number of catches) used for the final data analyses.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Within-school physical activity</italic>: A subsample of Grade 3/4 students (five students per class) were randomly selected (using a random number generator by a researcher not involved in the study) and invited to wear a waist-worn GT3X or GT3X+ accelerometer on two occasions (baseline and post-test) for one school week (five days at each time point). Accelerometers were worn for five consecutive school days, only during school hours (i.e. 9am to 3pm) [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Trained research assistants explained the process of wearing these devices to each student and provided a demonstration of how to wear the device on the hip (above the right knee). Data were collected and stored in 30-second epochs. Valid wear time was classified as a minimum of three school days (e.g., 9am to 3pm). At least 80% wear time during the school day was needed to be classified as a valid day [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Any 30-minute stretch of consecutive zeroes was classified as non-wear time. Cut points proposed by Evenson were used to classify levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Power analysis</title>
                  <p>Since the trial involved targeted outcomes associated with both Grade 6/7 peer leaders (e.g., leadership behaviors) as well as Grade 3/4 students (e.g., movement skill competence), two sets of power analyses were conducted to determine sample size calculations for each group. We conducted the power analyses using Optimal Design Software [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
                  <p><bold><italic toggle="yes">Primary outcome sample size parameters</italic>:</bold> In relation to the study’s primary outcome (teacher ratings of peer leaders’ transformational leadership behaviors), we considered that each group of peer leaders would include 8–10 Grade 6/7 students (equal number of boys and girls), who would work with each class of Grade 3/4 students. Thus, one Grade 6/7 class would be able to be split into three clusters and each cluster would be responsible for teaching a whole Grade 3/4 class. The intervention effect in our pilot study for peer leadership development was d = 1.09 [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the basis of alpha set at .05, Power (1 - β) set at .80, cluster size of 8, ICC = .05, effect size (δ = .80; based on established criteria for a large effect; [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]) we required 23 clusters of 8. By rounding up to 24 clusters of 8, with 3 clusters of 8 coming from one Grade 6/7 class per school, this equated to 8 schools (4 intervention and 4 control), for a total sample of 192 peer leaders.</p>
                  <p>In anticipation that a medium sized effect for leadership development might be more realistic given this efficacy trial would be implemented in more schools than our pilot study (δ = 0.60), on the basis of alpha set at .05, Power (1 - β) set at .80, cluster size of 8, ICC = .05, effect size (δ = .60) we would require 39 clusters of 8. On the basis of three clusters of 8 per school (i.e., one Grade 6/7 class per school), and to be balanced across intervention and control schools, this would necessitate (by rounding up) 42 clusters of 8, which would equate to 14 schools (7 intervention and 7 control) for a total of 336 peer leaders.</p>
                  <p><bold><italic toggle="yes">Secondary outcomes sample size parameters</italic>:</bold> The sample size calculations for the secondary research questions were powered based on the effect size derived for movement skill competency derived in our pilot trial (d = .95; 14). We anticipated that each class of younger students would include approximately 24 students (equal number of boys and girls) per class (approximately 30 students per class, but after accounting for anticipated enrolment). On the basis of alpha set at .05, Power (1 - β) set at .80, cluster size of 24, ICC = .05, effect size (δ = .50; based on established criteria for a medium effect; 52) we would require 24 clusters of 24. This would also align with the number of peer leadership groups (24 clusters of 8 Grade 6/7 students) delivering the program to the younger students. Based on 24 groups of 24 Grade 3/4 students, this would equate to 576 students from 8 schools (4 intervention and 4 control).</p>

                  <p>All analyses were conducted in SPSS version 27. Data were screened for patterns of missing data and outlier values. Multiple imputation of missing data was conducted using the fully conditional specification method and regression modelling for both the leaders and younger students. Ten imputed data sets were created for both the leader and younger student data sets. Values were imputed at the item and task level (for FMS) for all study variables with missing data. Constraints (minimum, maximum, and rounding) were specified for Likert-type items and FMS to ensure all imputed values were within the appropriate numerical range.</p>
                  <p>Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) were calculated for each variable at baseline and follow up (See Tables <xref rid="pone.0280261.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0280261.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Coefficient alphas were also calculated to assess internal consistency reliability for each variable at baseline and follow up (See <xref rid="pone.0280261.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0280261.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables). Both older and younger students were nested within their respected classrooms. Therefore, intraclass correlations (ICCs) and design effects were calculated for baseline and follow up measures of each outcome variable (See <xref rid="pone.0280261.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0280261.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables) to determine whether linear mixed modelling should be used to account for a random classroom effect. The ICC represents the proportion of variance attributed to the grouping structure (i.e., classrooms) compared to the total variance. The design effect represents the magnitude of the clustering effect while considering the average cluster (i.e., classroom) size, with larger numbers representing a larger clustering effect. If the design effect is larger than 2.0, linear mixed modelling with random intercept was used to account for the nesting structure of the data. Proportion of variance reduction was calculated to examine how much more variation in the outcome was accounted for by adding the treatment condition into the model. If the design effect is smaller than 2.0 at baseline, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used for the data analysis. Correspondingly <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> square change was reported to examine the amount of additional variance explained in an outcome when treatment condition was included in the regression model, compared to the model with only baseline assessment and gender. When design effects were &gt; 2.0 at baseline, but &lt; 2.0 at follow up, both linear mixed modelling and OLS regressions were used. If results did not deviate between the linear mixed model and OLS regression model, the results from the OLS regression model were reported.</p>

                  <p>In both linear mixed models and regression models, the treatment condition (0 = control, 1 = intervention) effect was modelled while controlling for baseline assessment and gender (0 = female, 1 = male). To examine whether the intervention was more effective for one gender compared to the other (e.g., was the intervention more effective for females compared to males?), condition by gender interaction effects were also included in the linear mixed models and OLS regression models alongside condition, gender, and baseline. Reported effects for the linear mixed models and OLS regression models are unstandardized beta coefficients derived from the ten analysis with ten imputed data sets.</p>

                <p>As mentioned above, given the second cohort could not be run due to COVID-19, the results presented below only represent results for Cohort 1. Mean and standard deviation values for outcomes are presented in Tables <xref rid="pone.0280261.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0280261.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Recruitment began by contacting the principals at 158 eligible schools within four school districts in the greater Vancouver area. Of the 158 schools contacts, 68 schools did not respond to any communications, 58 schools declined participation, 25 schools expressed some level of interest in the project, and ultimately 7 schools consented to participating in the study (4.4% consent rate). <xref rid="pone.0280261.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> outlines the recruitment of consenting schools and classes within these schools. Notably, one consenting school dropped out after baseline data collection due to a desire to focus on a different set of curricula. The remaining 6 schools consisted of 132 Grade 6/7 leaders (57.3% female) and 227 Grade 3/4 students (42.30% female).</p>

All condition*gender interaction effects were non-significant, and therefore, only the models including non-conditional effects (baseline, gender, condition) are reported. Overall, the intervention had no significant effect on teacher ratings of their student’s transformational leadership (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> = 0.201, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .272) after controlling for baseline and gender.</p>

                  <p>Overall, the program was well received by the intervention schools. A possible 20 sessions were to be implemented as planned by each intervention school. Of the 3 intervention schools, two implemented all sessions (self-reported 20/20 sessions delivered). The third school, due to a scheduling conflict, missed one PLPL session. Thus, these students participated in 19 of the 20 sessions (i.e., 30 minutes less intervention compared to other intervention schools). Program evaluation results are presented in <xref rid="pone.0280261.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>. Overall, the Grade 6/7 leaders were satisfied with the leadership program.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We developed, implemented, and tested the efficacy of a theory-driven, scalable, evidence-based peer leadership program targeting the physical literacy of elementary school students to determine its impact on (a) student leadership skills (primary outcome) and leadership self-efficacy (i.e., confidence to lead; secondary outcome), as well as (b) components of physical literacy (secondary outcomes) of younger students who received the transformational leadership informed FMS development intervention. Utilization of a peer-leader delivery system provided an opportunity for leadership skills to be taught and practiced. The PLPL trial utilized a train-the-trainer implementation strategy (the intervention delivered by teachers) that we believed was potentially scalable within the Canadian elementary school context.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, we did not find evidence that the primary outcome, teacher rated transformational leadership of Grade 6/7 students could be changed by a seven-session leadership learning program and the subsequent implementation of a 10-week peer-led program. Further, there was no additional evidence of intervention effects for secondary outcomes, components of physical literacy in terms of increased FMS, self-perceptions, perceived competence, motivation, or physical activity in younger Grade 3/4 students who participated in the 10-week program. These results contradict our earlier pilot study [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although this was an adapted GLASS program, we believe there are two critical factors that may explain our null findings in the current efficacy trial. First, the delivery mechanism for the training of peer leaders was modified. The intention with this different delivery method was to test a more realistic, scalable approach that mimicked ways in which teachers receive other professional learning opportunities and continuing education credits. In this trial, the research team led a workshop with teachers and those teachers subsequently delivered the content to their Grade 6/7 students. The older students then delivered the physical literacy program to younger students in their school. In contrast, our pilot study focused on peer leaders allowed for the research team to travel to the one intervention school and directly work with the students. The current study therefore had an additional messenger (i.e., the teacher) to relay information from the research team to the students. Balanced against the null findings for primary and secondary outcomes, the current trial results suggest that some critical information or quality control may have been lost in translation with teachers acting as the mediating party between the research team and the students. While teachers self-reported that all lessons were provided to their Grade 6/7 classes, we did not conduct a process evaluation for this aspect of the intervention.</p>
              <p>A second potential reason for null effects of this intervention may be due to a decrease in intervention effectiveness that has been shown to be a common occurrence when moving to larger-scale trials [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The change from a highly successful pilot study in a small number of schools leading to a randomized controlled trial with null findings would suggest that the current study’s different delivery modality did not work as anticipated [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It could also be that by replicating and extending this work, that in hindsight, the GLASS study could have been flawed. As both studies used many of the same strategies, we would expect similar results, but this was not the case. Possible threats to external validity, such as the larger number of schools and/or the change in age of the younger participants could also explain possible differences in results of the current trial. Our pilot study only included one intervention school, it was much easier for the research team to provide implementation support. In the current trial, the larger number of schools (3 intervention schools) did not allow for the research team to provide on-going support. Members of the research team viewed lessons delivered by the Grade 6/7 students early in the 10-week program and provided feedback to the leaders. However, these observations only occurred in Weeks 1–3 of the FMS programming, not across the full ten weeks. Process evaluation information would be critical to possibly understand where there may have been a diversion from planned activities when researchers were not present. It is notable that in terms of fidelity of delivering the physical literacy component of the intervention, only one session at one school was missed. This information was self-reported by the teachers to the study coordinator.</p>
              <p>From a measurement perspective, failure to identify a statistically significant effect for the primary outcome could be a result of ceiling effects with the primary outcome, which was scored on a five-point scale [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Baseline levels of teacher rated transformational leadership were already quite high. Thus, even if teacher ratings of their students changed (i.e., increased over time) there may have been minimal room for improvement. For example, intervention school teachers had a mean transformational leadership rating of 2.96 at baseline. This score increased to 3.25 at post-test, but the max score on this scale was a 4.0. Future trials that decide to use a similar scale may consider including a specific inclusion criterion relating to low scores on transformational leadership to ensure there is sufficient reason to intervene. Related to the movement skills of the younger children participating in this study, the dose may not have been sufficient to induce change. Notably, lessons across the ten-week program focused on six different object control skills each of which were the focus of a lesson three (catch, throw, two-handed strike, dribble) or four (kick, underhand throw) times across the 20 possible sessions. Thus, only half of the intervention time for younger students was spent learning and developing the skills that were assessed. It is plausible that students need additional time, practice and feedback to improve these skills in a clinically meaningful way. It could also be that younger children (Kindergarden, Grade 1, Grade 2) have less developed skills and thus are more likely to demonstrate skill development after participation in an intervention. The current study had Grade 3 and 4 students, which while only a few years older, meant their skills may have been more developed and less susceptible to change with a similar dose of intervention as given to younger students. As it relates to movement skills there may be a critical window of opportunity for interventions to see the largest improvements. The same could be possible for the psychological constructs that were assessed; however, longitudinal studies or long-term intervention follow-up would be needed to confirm this ‘critical window’ hypothesis.</p>
              <p>Existing evidence related to the use of a train-the-trainer model to deliver the intervention could be described as mixed [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280261.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, while the current study has null findings, this is not out of the ordinary. Indeed, a recent review of peer-led interventions found that while physical activity can be improved through such interventions. For the vast majority of behavioral, psychological, physiological, and leadership outcomes there were limited significant improvements [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast to these results, other intervention delivery modalities that use teachers or other trained facilitators appear to be more successful. Lander and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] report that providing training to teachers, who subsequently lead and deliver school-based interventions, have shown improvements in physical activity behaviors and improved motor skills. Further still, programs such as ‘Supporting Children’s Outcomes using Rewards, Exercise and Skills’ (SCORES) intervention [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have shown that trained facilitators who receive ongoing support can lead to improvements in physical activity, movement skills, and other health-related outcomes. Yet, when scaled-up and less on-going support is provided, effect sizes were much smaller [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Train-the-trainer strategies are important and necessary as they increase the feasibility of delivering programs. But who is trained and how much training they receive also plays a vital role for potential outcomes of the interventions.</p>
              <p>Strengths of the current study include the randomized design, the use of a train-the trainer implementation strategy which mimics a more realistic strategy than an intervention run exclusively by researchers, and the collection of a variety of measures at multiple levels (teacher, leaders, younger students). There are also limitations in the current study including the smaller sample than originally planned, which decreased our statistical power. As highlighted earlier, the study sample size was affected due to the mandatory pause in the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our initial power analyses necessitated that a total of 14 schools, 336 peer leaders, and 1,008 younger students would be needed to detect a medium effect size. In reality, we recruited 6 schools, 132 peer leaders, and 227 younger students. So we were underpowered and thus conclusions should be interpreted with caution. Other limitations include the lack of a detailed process evaluation across the duration of the intervention, which limits our ability to understand the true dose of intervention received by all participants. Lastly, we did not assess movement skill competence of the peer-leaders and as such cannot make determinations as to whether the differences in skill capability of these instructors contributed to null-findings related to changes in fundamental movement skills.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Based upon prior successful work, the evaluation of our leadership and physical literacy intervention in a larger scale efficacy study was warranted. Ultimately, no significant findings were found, suggesting that modifications to the current design are required if changes in primary and secondary outcomes are desired. Peer-led interventions still represent a promising, feasible modality for implementing such interventions [<xref rid="pone.0280261.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To improve the likelihood of impact, greater attention on implementation strategies, which address schools’ adoption of such peer leadership programs, should be considered as part of any future trials.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Huteen,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by <bold>31 October, 2022</bold>. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>
              <p>Venkat Rao Vishnumolakala</p>
              <p>Academic Editor</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Journal requirements:</p>
              <p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
              <p>1.Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
              <p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and</p>

              <p>2.Thank you for stating the following in the Funding Section of your manuscript:</p>
              <p>“Funding for this project is provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [Insights Grant #435-2017-0268]. The funding body (SSHRC) had no role in the design, data collection, analysis, interpretation of data, or the writing of the manuscript.

              <p>Reviewer #1: Dear Editors and Authors,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your patience in my review of this manuscript.</p>
              <p>I have carefully read the manuscript titled, “Evaluation of the Peer Leadership for Physical Literacy Intervention: A Cluster Randomized Control Trial”. Overall the manuscript is well-written, and the intervention itself appears to be novel. The train-the-trainer approach is particularly exciting and, as the authors pointed out, is a key component missing from physical literacy interventions. Ultimately, the results of the paper are underwhelming and could be interpreted as disappointing from a statistical significance perspective; however, I strongly believe there is much knowledge to be gained from well-conducted research, regardless of final p-values.</p>
              <p>Even so, I have several comments that I believe need to be addressed before the paper is acceptable for publication. I hope the authors find these comments helpful as they continue their work with this manuscript. These comments are primarily arranged chronologically and not necessarily in order of scale.</p>
              <p>1. The abstract is confusing. The purpose statement (listed as background) does not include an outcome variable, so the reader has no context regarding the purpose of the study. Secondly, the study timeline is unclear. L50-51 read as if there was a follow-up assessment and not an immediate post-intervention assessment.</p>
              <p>2. Why is a teacher-reported outcome the primary outcome? If the teachers were also the ones leading the training/intervention, as it appears to be, is there not a conflict of interest regarding their ability to score objectively? Also, what is the rationale behind having a teacher- and student-reported scores of transformational leadership?</p>
              <p>3. Physical literacy is never clearly defined in the introduction (only L110). To have a better justification for the multiple outcomes, the introduction needs to have a well-articulated definition of physical literacy and the need for programs to enhance multiple aspects of physical literacy.</p>
              <p>4. The GLASS study is first introduced as an external study (L100) but later reported as a pilot study (L210). Greater transparency in the relationship between the GLASS and PLPL intervention is needed in the introduction.</p>
              <p>5. L116 mentions how the GLASS intervention influenced PA, but this outcome is not listed above.</p>
              <p>6. Please revise the manuscript for clarity regarding the multiple outcomes. Sometimes they are presented as primary, secondary, or tertiary (results section), whereas other times they are simply listed as peer-leader leadership skills and student physical literacy outcomes (example L138-140). If a greater definition of physical literacy was provided in the introduction, I would suggest presenting as leadership skills and physical literacy outcomes. It is unclear why physical activity, which is an important component of physical literacy, is considered tertiary compared to other PL factors.</p>
              <p>7. Is there a justification for the two modifications made from GLASS to PLPL (L212)?</p>
              <p>8. L219- Were teachers compensated for their time?</p>
              <p>9. It is unclear how the intervention delivered from the peer-leaders to students was a physical literacy program. The authors mention that this intervention included “warm-up, demonstrate the movement skill, skill practice, and set-up and oversee the game” (L277-278), but this appears like the intervention was only targeting one aspect of physical literacy, movement competence (note: L261- it is referred to as a movement skills program). If indeed this was a movement skills intervention, the authors provide little rationale to include other physical literacy outcomes in the results such as perceived competence and physical activity.</p>
              <p>10. Was there a theoretical approach used in the physical literacy intervention?</p>
              <p>11. Why were only object control skills targeted?</p>
              <p>12. Was the movement competence of peer-leaders assessed? If not, how are you sure they have the competence to lead skill instruction?</p>
              <p>13. L283- what does “during class time” refer to here?</p>
              <p>14. L354-355: Did you modify the scale? If so, what modifications were made?</p>
              <p>15. L374- The overall description of motor assessment is lacking. How were motor skills assessed? Did you follow TGMD-3 instructions for assessment (e.g., skill demonstration, practice trial, test trials)? Did you do a different assessment approach? What is the throw/catch assessment? Was throwing scored during this assessment or just the number of catches? Was there a time limit for this test?</p>
              <p>16. L393-Since the catching task is not fully described, I have no way to interpret this statement.</p>
              <p>17. Please provide greater IRR details on raters who scored the TGMD test trials.</p>
              <p>18. L395- was the physical activity data collected using a stratified random sampling technique to ensure equal number of girls and boys? It does not appear so, but I think this would be important based on established sex-difference in this outcome.</p>
              <p>19. L491- Wouldn’t sex be a more appropriate term here?</p>
              <p>20. L528- Please double-check for consistent language- fundamental movement skills, motor skills, motor competence, and motor skill outcomes are all used throughout this manuscript.</p>
              <p>21. L535- if the interaction was non-significant, why is it re-included in the model and then interpreted (note: this appears to be further included as a finding in the discussion L629-631).</p>
              <p>22. Table 5- Throwing and kicking speed are well defined in the methods, but throw-catch combination score, throw components, and kick components are not clear. I am assuming that “components” is synonymous with TGMD or process. If that is the case, please revise the language in table 5 to align with the text.</p>
              <p>23. L576- Please confirm that five-session is correct. L255 mentions 7.</p>
              <p>24. It would be nice to have some greater depth in the discussion relating to other literature. For example, how do the null findings relate to other literature using similar train-the-trainer approaches (L592-596)? Is it that the pilot study was flawed (L604) of that it was implemented at a more critical window of motor skill development and malleability? What longitudinal data is available on motor skills and psychological constructs measured (L649)?</p>
              <p>25. L613- What is FMS?</p>

              <p>Thank you for your patience in my review of this manuscript.</p>
              <p>I have carefully read the manuscript titled, “Evaluation of the Peer Leadership for Physical Literacy Intervention: A Cluster Randomized Control Trial”. Overall the manuscript is well-written, and the intervention itself appears to be novel. The train-the-trainer approach is particularly exciting and, as the authors pointed out, is a key component missing from physical literacy interventions. Ultimately, the results of the paper are underwhelming and could be interpreted as disappointing from a statistical significance perspective; however, I strongly believe there is much knowledge to be gained from well-conducted research, regardless of final p-values.</p>

I hope the authors find these comments helpful as they continue their work with this manuscript. These comments are primarily arranged chronologically and not necessarily in order of scale.</p>
              <p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for their thorough review and helpful comments. We are glad that they found the manuscript to be relevant and interesting despite the lack of statistical significance of our findings. We have provided our responses to the Reviewers’ suggestions for improvement. We believe the manuscript has been strengthened and hope that it is now in acceptable form for publication in PLOS ONE.</p>
              <p>1. The abstract is confusing. The purpose statement (listed as background) does not include an outcome variable, so the reader has no context regarding the purpose of the study. Secondly, the study timeline is unclear. L50-51 read as if there was a follow-up assessment and not an immediate post-intervention assessment.</p>
              <p>We have amended the abstract to address the Reviewer’s concerns. Specific changes that were made to the abstract include: 1) changing the first heading from “Background” to “Purpose”, 2) we have now moved the listing of the primary and secondary outcomes to the Purpose section of the abstract. This was done to provide further context about the focus and emphasis of the intervention, and 3) we changed our language to better articulate that the follow-up assessment was done immediately post-intervention. We have provided the first two sections of the abstract with these changes below for convenience. These changes can also be viewed on lines 37-53.</p>
              <p>Purpose: The purpose of this research was to develop, implement, and test the efficacy of a theory-driven, evidence-informed peer leadership program for elementary school students (Grade 6 and 7; age 11-12 years) and the Grade 3/4 students with whom they were partnered. The primary outcome was teacher ratings of their Grade 6/7 students’ transformational leadership behaviors. Secondary outcomes included: Grade 6/7 students’ leadership self-efficacy, as well as Grade 3/4 student motivation, perceived competence, general self-concept, fundamental movement skills, school-day physical activity, program adherence, and program evaluation. </p>
              <p>Methods: We conducted a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. In 2019, 6 schools comprising 7 teachers, 132 leaders, and 227 grade 3 and 4 students were randomly allocated to the intervention or waitlist control conditions. Intervention teachers took part in a half-day workshop (January 2019), delivered 7 x 40 minute lessons to Grade 6/7 peer leaders (February and March 2019), and these peer leaders subsequently ran a ten-week physical literacy development program for Grade 3/4 students (2x30 minute sessions per week). Waitlist-control students followed their usual routines. Assessments were conducted at baseline (January 2019) and immediately post-intervention (June 2019). </p>
              <p>2. Why is a teacher-reported outcome the primary outcome? If the teachers were also the ones leading the training/intervention, as it appears to be, is there not a conflict of interest regarding their ability to score objectively? Also, what is the rationale behind having a teacher- and student-reported scores of transformational leadership?</p>
              <p>There are a couple of different reasons why teacher ratings of Grade 6/7 students was chosen as the primary outcome for this study. First, transformational leadership is the most proximal outcome related to the intervention that was delivered (that is, that construct was the primary target as part of the intervention, with all other outcomes putatively deriving from that). Had we chosen student self-reported ratings of transformational leadership there may have been a higher likelihood of an inflated, self-serving bias within peer-leaders’ own ratings. Teachers on the other hand are one-step removed, but since they interact and observe these students on an on-going basis while at school, the teacher was seen as the best person to report on leadership behaviors. Indeed, teachers are regularly required to assess students’ competency in a range of academic outcomes. No other third party in a school setting would be as well equipped to rate an entire class of students, as they would be scoring without any context, thus being potentially subject to Hawthorn effects. Similarly, had we used an external rater (e.g. researcher) to appraise students’ behaviors, such assessments (e.g., over 2-3 classes) would provide a very limited timeframe to inform those appraisals. In addition, due to the use of an experimental design, if any inflation in teacher ratings occurred, due to the use of random allocation, one would expect that any potentially inflated scores would be equivalent across conditions. </p>
              <p>Although we operationalized teacher-ratings of students’ peer leadership as our primary outcome, we also included students’ self-ratings as a secondary outcome. For the reasons/limitations we highlight above it was not considered as robust a measure as teacher ratings of peer-leaders’ behaviours. Had there been differences in intervention effects for self- versus teacher-rated measures, we saw potential to examine (as an exploratory question) discrepancies between these two ratings and whether those discrepancies accounted for some of the study findings (e.g., potentially elevated peer-leader self-efficacy). As the intervention effects for both self- and teacher-ratings were null, we feel that any discussion of why we used self-ratings of leadership is somewhat redundant. However, for the sake of full transparency (and in alignment with our pre-trial registration) we believe that data derived from both sets of measures should be reported. </p>
              <p>3. Physical literacy is never clearly defined in the introduction (only L110). To have a better justification for the multiple outcomes, the introduction needs to have a well-articulated definition of physical literacy and the need for programs to enhance multiple aspects of physical literacy.</p>
              <p>We have expanded our Introduction to clearly articulate the definition of physical literacy. It is now defined in the text on lines 110-112. </p>
              <p>Physical literacy is defined as the “motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge, and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities for life” (20). </p>
              <p>Additionally, we have provided rationale for why interventions that target components of physical literacy are important. As supported by a recent publication by Carl et al., (2022) physical literacy “cultivates a holistic and integrative understanding of human movement” as it allows us to target multiple outcomes at once and intervention evidence suggests that a composite measure of physical literacy can indeed be improved. Yet, the extent to which components of physical literacy are improved are more nuanced with physical components easier to improve compared to psychological components. Expansion of this idea is provided below and on lines 110-124 in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Physical literacy is defined as the “motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge, and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities for life” (20). Physical literacy thus takes a more holistic perspective in understanding the attributes that contribute to one’s capability to be physically active across the lifespan. Multiple interventions have focused on individual components of physical literacy from a physical, psychological, or social perspective (21). However, targeting multiple components of physical literacy within a single intervention may be more advantageous, as it will help elucidate those factor(s) that best assist an individual in being physically active. For example, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of physical literacy interventions demonstrated that there were significant treatment effects for interventions when all physical literacy outcomes were combined (21). Yet, these results are more nuanced with interventions exerting differential effects on the varying outcome categories. This same review describes that there appears to be the strongest evidence for improving physical competence, while psychological outcomes (e.g., motivation, confidence) are harder to improve through interventions (21). </p>

              <p>4. The GLASS study is first introduced as an external study (L100) but later reported as a pilot study (L210). Greater transparency in the relationship between the GLASS and PLPL intervention is needed in the introduction.</p>
              <p>We agree with the Reviewer that the language previously used was confusing. We have amended the document throughout to clearly articulate that the GLASS trial is a pilot study. We have highlighted key modifications from the pilot GLASS study to the current PLPL trial on lines 227to 238. This text is also provided below for convenience. </p>
              <p>Two key changes were made to the current trial compared to our earlier GLASS trial. First, the target age group of younger students was different, shifting from Kindergarten, Grade 1 and 2 in our previous non-randomized trial to Grade 3 and 4 students in this efficacy trial. Secondly, previously where a research team delivered all content to peer leaders, a train-the-trainer approach was adopted and the research team delivered all content to Grade 6/7 teachers through a half-day workshop at the last author’s university. These teachers then delivered the content to their students. This change in delivery mechanism was designed with intervention scalability and sustainability foregrounded. Specifically, having teachers deliver programs within their own classes are more likely to be sustained and delivered at scale compared to an external research team that would be required to deliver a program across multiple schools on an ongoing basis. </p>
              <p>While the current PLPL has a few changes compared to the GLASS pilot study, according to a recent review by Beets et al., 2020, it is common for changes to be made when scaling-up interventions. </p>

              <p>5. L116 mentions how the GLASS intervention influenced PA, but this outcome is not listed above.</p>
              <p>We have reported that physical activity was assessed in the initial GLASS study (line 101). However, to be more clear, we have included reference to a specific non-significant finding related to school-day physical activity at the end of the paragraph for transparency about findings in the GLASS study. This physical activity result can be found on line 128-130. </p>
              <p>The study did not result in a statistically significant difference in terms of school day physical activity (d = 0.29; p = 0.313).</p>
              <p>6. Please revise the manuscript for clarity regarding the multiple outcomes. Sometimes they are presented as primary, secondary, or tertiary (results section), whereas other times they are simply listed as peer-leader leadership skills and student physical literacy outcomes (example L138-140). If a greater definition of physical literacy was provided in the introduction, I would suggest presenting as leadership skills and physical literacy outcomes. It is unclear why physical activity, which is an important component of physical literacy, is considered tertiary compared to other PL factors.</p>
              <p>To best align with our pre-registration of this trial on clinicaltrials.gov, we have sought to use consistent language in our manuscript as that used on this pre-registration website. As such, we specifically use the terms primary outcome and secondary outcomes. To be clear, the primary outcome of this trial is teacher ratings of Grade 6/7 students’ transformational leadership behaviors. All other outcomes are secondary outcomes in this trial. These secondary outcomes include both outcomes for Grade 6/7 students and Grade 3/4 students. These changes have been made throughout the manuscript. Additionally, after reviewing our preregistration where we listed physical activity as a secondary outcome, we have now made sure to also list physical activity as a secondary outcome throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>7. Is there a justification for the two modifications made from GLASS to PLPL (L212)?</p>
              <p>The two key modifications made to the PLPL trial compared to the GLASS trial was the target age group for the physical literacy component of the intervention and the delivery mechanism of the intervention materials. We have provided the modifications on lines 227-238 of the manuscript. The primary emphasis related to the delivery mechanism was focusing on scalability and sustainability. Ultimately change in delivery agent is the biggest contributing factor to a drop in effect size when scaling up interventions (Beets et al., 2020). If an intervention with a different delivery agent in a scaled up version is successful this points to something that we can provide to policy makers as an easily modifiable program. Relative to the change in age group, our thinking at the time of development was focused on trying to obtain valid and reliable results for the self-report measures. Further, given the success of the GLASS trial, we were interested if similar results could be found for an older age group. </p>
              <p>Two key changes were made to the current trial compared to our earlier GLASS trial. First, the target age group of younger students was different, shifting from Kindergarten, Grade 1 and 2 in our previous non-randomized trial to Grade 3 and 4 students in this efficacy trial. Secondly, previously where a research team delivered all content to peer leaders, a train-the-trainer approach was adopted and the research team delivered all content to Grade 6/7 teachers through a half-day workshop at the last author’s university. These teachers then delivered the content to their students. This change in delivery mechanism was designed with intervention scalability and sustainability foregrounded. Specifically, having teachers deliver programs within their own classes are more likely to be sustained and delivered at scale compared to an external research team that would be required to deliver a program across multiple schools on an ongoing basis.</p>

              <p>8. L219- Were teachers compensated for their time?</p>
              <p>Students received compensation for their participation in the study (depending on the measures completed) and the schools involved in the study were provided with equipment packs valued at approximately $250 CDN. The teachers themselves were not directly compensated (monetarily), but they were provided with all of the materials and resources free of charge that were required to complete the intervention (see lines 261 to 264). </p>
              <p>9. It is unclear how the intervention delivered from the peer-leaders to students was a physical literacy program. The authors mention that this intervention included “warm-up, demonstrate the movement skill, skill practice, and set-up and oversee the game” (L277-278), but this appears like the intervention was only targeting one aspect of physical literacy, movement competence (note: L261- it is referred to as a movement skills program). If indeed this was a movement skills intervention, the authors provide little rationale to include other physical literacy outcomes in the results such as perceived competence and physical activity.</p>
              <p>We have defined physical literacy on lines 110 to 112 as the “motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge, and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities for life”. Notably, the ‘gold standard’ definition of physical literacy is still being debated (see Carl et al., 2022 or Lounsbery and McKenzie, 2015). Until there is consensus, it is not possible to definitively conclude what does or does not need to be assessed to be considered a “physical literacy” intervention. There is clear alignment between the definition of physical literacy and secondary outcomes related to the Grade 3/4 students, such as fundamental movement skills (skill), perceived competence (attitude), motivation (attitude), self-concept (attitude), and physical activity. While we did not have an explicit measure of “knowledge” in this particular intervention, there is clearly a knowledge component to our intervention, as the peer leaders used key teaching points when instructing when trying to develop the movement skills of these younger students. Additionally, Peer Leaders were taught strategies to motivate their students based on Transformational Leadership theory (e.g., being an enthusiastic leader). Peer leaders also learnt to deliver activity sessions that were designed to improve students' perceived and actual motor competence (developmentally appropriate activities should have effects on both perceived and actual competence). Finally, peer leaders were encouraged to remind students about the importance of learning movement skills and how they transfer to different sports and activities. This could be considered “knowledge”. </p>

              <p>In fact, when we look at other intervention studies included in a systematic review of physical literacy interventions (Carl et al., 2022) we can see multiple examples of studies where the central component of the intervention was focused on the movement skill instruction. Further, when examining these interventions, they too did not include explicit sessions focused solely on each component of physical literacy. They also did not measure all components of physical literacy. Two examples include the following studies: </p>

              <p>10. Was there a theoretical approach used in the physical literacy intervention?</p>
              <p>Consistent with our pilot GLASS study, this intervention was informed by Transformational Leadership Theory as described in “Peer-Leadership Development Program (Intervention Part 1)”. See lines 248-260. This was done because the primary outcome of the intervention was teacher-ratings of Grade 6/7 transformational leadership. Core components of our intervention framework that was informed by Transformational Leadership Theory (as per Kelloway and Barling, 2000) include a) providing opportunities to practice those behaviors and b) receiving feedback on the implementation of those strategies. Both of these components took place during the physical literacy intervention as the direct instruction from Grade 6/7 students to Grade 3/4 students represents practicing leadership behaviors. Receiving feedback took place in the first couple of weeks of the physical literacy component of the intervention as members of the research team provided direct feedback to Grade 6/7 students after watching their lessons. There was no separate theoretical approach focused specifically related to physical literacy, as this was not the primary outcome of the intervention. </p>

              <p>11. Why were only object control skills targeted?</p>
              <p>Object control skills were targeted for three key reasons. First, the initial GLASS study only focused on object control skills. Given the large effect size associated with an improvement of object control skills in the GLASS trial, we were justified in once again targeting these skills. Second, existing evidence in the field of motor development repeatedly demonstrates that object control skills are a better predictor of current and future physical activity participation compared to locomotor skills (Barnett et al., 2009; Pienaar et al., 2021). Third, the choice in how many skills to assess was in part made due to pragmatic and feasibility reasons. Working in schools is a significant undertaking and often involves a condensed period of time to collect data. In the case of this study, we were constrained to assessing 20-30 students in a one-hour period, thus it was not feasible to assess all six object control skills that aligned with lessons nor expand beyond object control skills and include locomotor and stability skills. </p>

              <p>12. Was the movement competence of peer-leaders assessed? If not, how are you sure they have the competence to lead skill instruction?</p>
              <p>The movement competence of peer-leaders was not assessed. This would certainly have been an interesting inclusion in the current study and provides an interesting future direction for this line of work. However, competence in a skill or set of skills does not necessarily equate to teaching competence either. Indeed, it may be that administering the intervention in this way mimics the increasing trend of classroom teachers being responsible for instructing physical education instead of having a specialized physical education teacher. While we may never be sure that peer-leaders have the physical competence to lead skill instruction, peer leaders were provided with a multitude of resources to facilitate their instruction including: receiving instruction from their teachers, being given practice sessions to practice their teaching, being provided with key teaching points and specific planned activities, as well as feedback from the research team during the initial weeks of the intervention. We have now included this as a limitation on lines 702 to 704.</p>
              <p>Lastly, we did not assess movement skill competence of the peer-leaders and as such cannot make determinations as to whether the differences in skill capability of these instructors contributed to null-findings related to changes in fundamental movement skills.</p>
              <p>13. L283- what does “during class time” refer to here?</p>
              <p>We have deleted “during class time” so that it is not assumed that lessons were planned at the same time as the class in which lessons were being delivered. All lessons delivered by the Grade 6/7 students were developed and planned during a set time in the school day that was separate from the direct instruction periods with Grade 3/4 students.</p>
              <p>14. L354-355: Did you modify the scale? If so, what modifications were made?</p>
              <p>The scale was not modified. To be clear, we used the scale developed by Sebire and colleagues . This scale is provided in the Supplementary Materials for this manuscript. We provide the Sebire et al reference below if the Reviewer would like to read the specifics about this scale.</p>

              <p>15. L374- The overall description of motor assessment is lacking. How were motor skills assessed? Did you follow TGMD-3 instructions for assessment (e.g., skill demonstration, practice trial, test trials)? Did you do a different assessment approach? What is the throw/catch assessment? Was throwing scored during this assessment or just the number of catches? Was there a time limit for this test?</p>
              <p>More details have been provided on lines 393 to 430 to specify procedures related to the motor skill assessments. To answer the Reviewer’s specific questions, motor skills were assessed using both a process and product approach. The process approach entails the observation of behavioral components of a skill and making a subjective determination as to whether the varying skill criteria were completed or not. The product approach entails quantifying the outcome of the movement. Overhand throw and kicking were assessed via a process approach using criteria from the Test of Gross Motor Development-3rd edition. Product outcomes were included for throwing, kicking, and catching. Throw and kick speed were recorded and number of successful catches were recorded. While the criteria for the Test of Gross Motor Development-3rd edition were used, there were two modifications to the traditional protocols. First, there was no demonstration of the throw and kick. This is due to the fact that all students knew what these skills were and we were interested in understanding their ‘true’ capability. Additionally, since we were interested in the product outcome, we instructed students to throw/kick the ball as hard as they could. Instructing participants in this way helps to elicit their most developmentally advanced movement pattern (Barnett et al., 2020). The other modification was that instead of completing two trials, we completed five trials of throwing and kicking. All participants were allowed a practice trial prior to their actual scored assessments. </p>
              <p>The throw-catch assessment is a newer assessment, which we have more explicitly explained in the manuscript. In this dual task, the only assessment was number of successful catches. Thus, the throw was not scored. This is in part due to the fact that individuals could choose to throw a ball any way they wanted (underhand, overhand, side-arm). As now stated in the manuscript, this assessment was completed twice with each trial lasting 30 seconds each to complete as many throws and catches as possible. Participants were given a practice trial as well, if they wanted.</p>

              <p>FMS: Three FMS (throw, kick, catch) were assessed as a measure of object control skill competence. Process scores for kicking and throwing were assessed using criteria from the Test of Gross Motor Development-3rd edition (40). Process scores for catching were not recorded, as catching was completed in a dual-task format making it inappropriate to use criteria from the Test of Gross Motor Development-3rd edition. Scores derived from these measures have shown adequate factorial validity (i.e., one factor model for FMS competence; (χ2 (65) = 327.61, p &lt; .001, comparative fit index = .95, Tucker-Lewis index = .94, root mean square error of approximation = .10) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95-0.97) (40, 41). Participants were filmed from the side and rear-view using iPads. Skill demonstrations were not provided, but practice attempts were allowed. Two research assistants, blinded to group allocation (e.g., intervention, control) completed all coding of throwing and kicking process scores. Each research assistant was provided with one hour of training by the project coordinator (who has 10+ years experience of motor skill assessment research). This training included explanation of skill criteria and practice coding. Prior to the beginning of formalized coding, both research assistants coded 10% of all kicking and throwing videos. Research assistants had to obtain ≥ 90% agreement at the component level for both skills with the project coordinator, which was achieved. </p>
              <p>Product scores were also assessed for kicking (maximal speed) (42, 43), overhand throwing (maximal speed) (42, 43), and catching (number of successful catches; 44). Throw and kick speed were completed by asking participants to throw or kick a ball as hard as they could at a wall 20 feet away. Speed was measured using a Stalker Pro II radar gun. The capability to assess skills using product and process scores provides a more holistic understanding of one’s level of competence and has shown moderate to strong agreement with process scores in pediatric populations (45, 46). In accordance with previous studies using product scores and the use of the best score (42, 43, 47), we used five complete trials of both the throw and kick, respectively. The dual throw-catch task required a participant to stand behind a line (approximately three times their height) away from a wall. Upon being instructed to start the task, each participant was to take a tennis ball and throw it at a blank wall (using any throw pattern they wanted) and then try to catch the ball (on the bounce or out of the air) while remaining behind the line. Participants were free to move about the area as much as they wanted. The only place they could not go was in front of their designated line. If the thrown ball did not come back across the participant’s line or went too far away, the participant was to run to a basket of tennis balls (6 feet away from the participant) and obtain another tennis ball and continue the task. This sequence of events was repeated as many times as possible in 30 seconds with the number of catches recorded as the final result. Throwing during this task was not assessed in any way. The catching task had two trials (30 seconds each) with the best result of the two trials (most number of catches) used for the final data analyses.</p>

              <p>Given the additional information provided about the throwing-catching test, we now hope that all statements related to the motor skills assessments can be better interpreted. Should the Reviewer have any further questions, we would be happy to further clarify this information. Specifics of this throw-catch tasks are now available on lines 418 to 430 and can also be read about in a previous research paper cited below. </p>

Inter-rater reliability with the project coordinator (who has 10 years of experience in the field of motor development) was calculated to be &gt;90% for both raters. As such, raters were allowed to continuing scoring. This information can now be found on lines 402 to 409.</p>

              <p>18. L395- was the physical activity data collected using a stratified random sampling technique to ensure equal number of girls and boys? It does not appear so, but I think this would be important based on established sex-difference in this outcome.</p>
              <p>As there were five students per class, it was not possible at the individual level within each class to achieve an equal number of boys and girls being assessed. However, through the use of a random number generator, we did a 2/3 split (either 2 girls and 3 boys or 2 boys and 3 girls). While we acknowledge that there is indeed an established sex-difference in these outcomes, examining such differences was not a key research question within the present manuscript. </p>
              <p>19. L491- Wouldn’t sex be a more appropriate term here?</p>
              <p>Our preference is to keep the term gender. As you will see in supplementary materials, we asked students to self-identify their gender, not their sex. As such, for consistency, we will keep the same terminology used in the data collection.</p>
              <p>20. L528- Please double-check for consistent language- fundamental movement skills, motor skills, motor competence, and motor skill outcomes are all used throughout this manuscript.</p>
              <p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. For consistency, we have used the term “fundamental movement skill(s)” throughout the manuscript. The only time “motor” is used is specifically when referencing the “Test of Gross Motor Development-3rd edition” which is how we assessed the process outcomes of two fundamental movement skills, kicking and overhand throwing. </p>
              <p>21. L535- if the interaction was non-significant, why is it re-included in the model and then interpreted (note: this appears to be further included as a finding in the discussion L629-631). </p>
              <p>The Reviewer brings up a very good point and as such we have rerun our analyses without the inclusion of this non-significant effect. Results in Table 5 have been updated and we have removed the Discussion points out of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>22. Table 5- Throwing and kicking speed are well defined in the methods, but throw-catch combination score, throw components, and kick components are not clear. I am assuming that “components” is synonymous with TGMD or process. If that is the case, please revise the language in table 5 to align with the text.</p>
              <p>Yes, the Reviewer is correct in their interpretation. We have now amended the language used in Table 5 to clearly articulate the process scores for throwing and kicking. Table 5 now lists “Throw Process Scores (as assessed by the Test of Gross Motor Development-3rd edition)” and “Kick Process Scores (as assessed by the Test of Gross Motor Development-3rd edition)”. </p>
              <p>23. L576- Please confirm that five-session is correct. L255 mentions 7.</p>
              <p>We have amended the reference to the number of sessions in the Discussion to reflect that there were 7, not five sessions in total for this program. There were four lessons that focused on curriculum and three sessions that provided the peer-leaders (Grade 6/7 students) with practical opportunities to practice their teaching of the movement skill lessons. This change can now be seen on line 605.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, we did not find evidence that the primary outcome, teacher rated transformational leadership of Grade 6/7 students could be changed by a seven-session leadership learning program and the subsequent implementation of a 10-week peer-led program.</p>
              <p>24. It would be nice to have some greater depth in the discussion relating to other literature. For example, how do the null findings relate to other literature using similar train-the-trainer approaches (L592-596)? </p>
              <p>The author brings up a good point, as such we have added to our manuscript on lines 673 to 689. Previous work by our team and others has shown that previous peer-led interventions are capable of enacting meaningful physical activity behavior change. There is limited evidence in the peer-review literature that supports opportunities for meaningful change in motor skills, thus we require more studies before we can make definitive statements. When looking at other interventions, work by Lander et al. (2016) has shown that interventions where teachers are trained and delivered interventions can lead to meaningful improvements in both motor skills and physical activity. Overall, the null findings for most of our study outcomes could be seen as contradictory to previous literature. However, balanced against the novel design, more research will be needed to determine whether this study is unique in its null findings or whether scaled-up versions are capable of improving health and leadership behaviors. Relative to the pilot GLASS trial, there may have been program drift (i.e., the intervention was not delivered to the full extent or in as thorough a way). We now know the model of designing an intervention in this way is scalable, so moving forward we can tweak the program to try and ensure that sessions are more targeted on our outcomes of interest. With that said, as the reviewer rightly notes in their overall appraisal of the paper, we feel it is important to report such null findings, to ensure that researchers and practitioners have a fully informed understanding of the efficacy of various interventions in this setting. </p>

              <p>Existing evidence related to the use of a train-the-trainer model to deliver the intervention could be described as mixed. Thus, while the current study has null findings, this is not out of the ordinary. Indeed, a recent review of peer-led interventions found that while physical activity can be improved through such interventions. For the vast majority of behavioral, psychological, physiological, and leadership outcomes there were limited significant improvements (6). In contrast to these results, other intervention delivery modalities that use teachers or other trained facilitators appear to be more successful. Lander and colleagues (56) report that providing training to teachers, who subsequently lead and deliver school-based interventions, have shown improvements in physical activity behaviors and improved motor skills. Further still, programs such as ‘Supporting Children’s Outcomes using Rewards, Exercise and Skills' (SCORES) intervention (57) have shown that trained facilitators who receive ongoing support can lead to improvements in physical activity, movement skills, and other health-related outcomes. Yet, when scaled-up and less on-going support is provided, effect sizes were much smaller (58). Train-the-trainer strategies are important and necessary as they increase the feasibility of delivering programs. But who is trained and how much training they receive also plays a vital role for potential outcomes of the interventions.</p>
              <p>25. Is it that the pilot study was flawed (L604) of that it was implemented at a more critical window of motor skill development and malleability? </p>
              <p>As we discuss on lines 612 to 647 we make the case for reasons we think the scale-up from the GLASS study to the current PLPL study may have been flawed. Prior research supports the common finding that there is decreased effectiveness of scaled-up version of trials compared to smaller, previous iterations.

              <p>We do not have enough evidence in this study to derive insight into when and where a ‘critical window’ of opportunity may exist for the improvement of movement skills. This would require a study design that lasts multiple years and/or examines a larger age cohort of younger students. However, it should be noted that multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to motor skill development support the fact that motor skills can be improved at all ages throughout childhood. This would support that skill performance is malleable at any age and not specific to one point in developmental time. This would then suggest that a scaled-up version of our intervention should hypothetically work at any age. We have provided specific references below in support of this. </p>

              <p>As stated on lines 657 to 672, the null motor skill findings could be the result of assessing a limited number of skills while the programming itself focused on a wider array of skills. It could also be that since there was a change in the implementation mechanism in this randomized controlled trial where the research team is one step removed compared to the pilot study (ultimately to support potential scale-up), these null findings could be expected. </p>
              <p>26. What longitudinal data is available on motor skills and psychological constructs measured (L649)?</p>
              <p>Lastly, we mention that longitudinal studies would be needed to try and support a possible “critical window” hypothesis. Given that this study was an experimental design, we do not find it appropriate to cover information related to longitudinal measurement of motor skills and psychological constructs in the Discussion. We would refer the Reviewer to more appropriate (and recent) publications on this topic, such as the systematic review conducted by Barnett and colleagues published in Sports Medicine. This reference is provided below. </p>

              <p>FMS refers to “fundamental movement skills”. This acronym has been specified in the third paragraph of our Background/Introduction and can be seen on line 101. </p>

              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions.

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you again for your patience in this review. I know the authors and editors were naturally (and rightfully) anxious to move forward with this manuscript; however, the end of this term has been particularly challenging with personal and professional happenings. I sincerely apologize for my delay.</p>
              <p>Thank you to the authors for your revisions. I believe the manuscript is stronger in its present form. I have no more major concerns with the document, but I do still have a few minor comments that should be addressed.</p>
              <p>• L56, “student rated transformational leadership”. Is this a primary or secondary outcome? It would be helpful to have this listed in the descriptions of outcomes in L41-45.</p>
              <p>• L60- Why is teacher adherence listed as the first point in the discussion when this was not a listed outcome (L41-45)?</p>
              <p>• L125- Shouldn’t teams be possessive?</p>
              <p>• Thank you for the increased description of PL. I think this helps situate the research.</p>
              <p>• L250- Peer Leadership Intervention- Were FMS ever taught to the teachers to teach to the peer leaders in the train-the-trainer model?</p>
              <p>• L404- Interesting that TGMD testing protocol was not followed but children were scored on this assessment. Perhaps this should be mentioned in the discussion</p>
              <p>• L411- Include a statement that both RAs coded a unique set of children, and there was no overlap between coders.</p>
              <p>• L425- Typo. Change to “much”.</p>
              <p>• L429- What constitutes a catch? Could a trap motion be a catch?</p>
              <p>• Table 2- Why is MVPA nested under Movement Skill Competence?</p>
              <p>• L571- Please remove “also”.</p>
              <p>• L572- Missing parenthesis</p>
              <p>• For clarity, I suggest making separate tables for Grade 3/4 psychological outcomes, FMS, and PA. Right now, it is odd to have the FMS reported with psychological outcomes in the text but with PA in the table.</p>
