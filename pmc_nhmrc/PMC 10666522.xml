                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Falls are frequent and devastating events for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we investigated whether laboratory-based reactive step training combined with home-based volitional step training was effective in improving balance recovery and stepping ability in people with PD.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Forty-four people with idiopathic PD were randomized into intervention or control groups. Intervention participants performed unsupervised volitional step training using home-based exergames (80+ minutes/week) for 12 weeks and attended reactive step training sessions in which they were exposed to slip and trip perturbations at 4 and 8 weeks. Control participants continued their usual activities. Primary outcomes were balance recovery following an induced-trip/slip and choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) at the 12-week reassessment. Secondary outcomes comprised sensorimotor, balance, cognitive, psychological, complex stepping (inhibitory CSRT and Stroop Stepping Test [SST]), gait measures, and falls experienced in everyday life.</p>

                <sec id="section3-15459683231206743">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>At reassessment, the intervention group had significantly fewer total laboratory-induced falls and faster CSRT compared to the control group (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05). The intervention group also had significantly faster inhibitory CSRT and SST movement times and made fewer mistakes in the SST (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05). There were no significant differences in the rate of every day falls or other secondary outcome measures between the groups.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Combined volitional and reactive step training improved balance recovery from an induced-perturbation, voluntary stepping time, and stepping accuracy in cognitively challenging tests in people with PD. Further research is required to determine whether such combined step training can prevent daily-life falls in this population.</p>

              <p>Recent studies have reported promising effects of reactive step training (e.g. repeated perturbations) and volitional step training (e.g. stepping onto step targets in multiple directions) for reducing falls in people with PD.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr21-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr22-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr23-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> While both training modalities target impaired stepping performance, these interventions likely lead to reduced fall risk via distinctly different mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Systematic review evidence in older adults<sup><xref rid="bibr10-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> has shown that reactive step training evokes task-specific sensorimotor adaptations for successful balance recovery with a relatively low dose (e.g. a few sessions),<sup><xref rid="bibr25-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="bibr26-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr27-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> whereas volitional step training induces gradual musculoskeletal and functional improvements over longer timeframes (e.g. 12 weeks).<sup><xref rid="bibr28-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Some studies in people with PD have incorporated reactive stepping induced by sudden treadmill starts and stops into multicomponent training.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> One study involving 18 participants used a reactive balance training dose of 1 hour/day, 3 times/week for 8 weeks, and reported a non-significant reduction in falls in the intervention group relative to the control group.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The other study, involving 45 participants, had a higher reactive step training dose, that is, 2 phases of 4-week physiotherapist-supervised training 3 times/week (60 minutes each session) along with home-based exercises 5 times/ week (60 minutes each session).<sup><xref rid="bibr23-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Fall rates were significantly reduced in the training group who completed the program compared to the control group during and beyond the trial period. While the above 2 studies demonstrated that combined voluntary and reactive step training could prevent falls, the high doses of both supervised and unsupervised training required may be impractical for many people with PD to undertake<sup><xref rid="bibr30-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and too resource intensive to implement at large scale.</p>
              <p>Considering the above, we envisioned a less resource-intensive intervention comprising both volitional and reactive step training may also be efficacious in reducing fall risk in people with PD if (a) the volitional step training comprised enjoyable interactive stepping exergames that could be performed unsupervised at home, and (b) the reactive step training intervention had high ecological validity with respect to the nature of the slip and trip perturbations. In this regard, we considered training participants to successfully negotiate unexpected trip and slip hazards on an overground walkway would generalize better to such events that occur in everyday life than more artificial treadmill belt translations. Consequently, due to higher task specificity, only low training doses may be required to improve reactive balance, as previously found in studies involving older people.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="bibr26-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr27-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="bibr32-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr33-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Thus, the primary aim of this study was to examine the effects of an intervention comprising 12 weeks of home-based high-dose unsupervised step training exergames (80+ minutes/week) interspersed with low-dose supervised laboratory-based reactive step training sessions on 2 key indices of fall risk: choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) and balance recovery to slip and trip perturbations in people with PD. Secondary aims were to (i) examine the effects of the intervention on sensorimotor, balance, cognitive, and clinical risk factors for falls, complex stepping tasks, and gait adaptability and (ii) obtain pilot data on the effect of this intervention approach for reducing daily-life falls.</p>

                <p>We conducted an assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial involving 44 people with PD who were randomly allocated into intervention or control groups. A sample size calculation for a Poison regression analysis was conducted with the following assumptions: a 70% fall rate in the control group, a 10% dropout rate, a significance level of &lt;.05 and a power of 0.8. This revealed that 44 eligible participants were required (22 in each group) to detect a 50% reduction in the number of laboratory-induced falls in the intervention group. Participants were enrolled between September 2018 and September 2019. We prospectively registered the trial protocol on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001515280).

The step mat had 6 stepping panels (left, right, 2 back, and 2 fronts) around 2 central stance panels used to interact with 5 games. Games were designed to train directed and timed step responses with additional cognitive stimuli requiring working memory, visuospatial skills, inhibition, and attention. Participants could choose their preferred games and appropriate difficulty levels (beginner, easy, medium, hard, and expert) but were required to play a core game to promote rapid and timed stepping (<italic toggle="yes">Stepmania</italic>) each day before the remaining games were unlocked. They were instructed to play the games in a few separate sessions to reach at least 80 minutes of gameplay per week. The gameplay data were transferred to and monitored in a web application. If participants did less than 80 minutes of exercise per week for 2 weeks, they were contacted by telephone to encourage adherence and address any barriers to participation. Participants were given a booklet containing instructions and safety precautions, and additional visits and telephone support were provided for participants who experienced difficulties.</p>

                  <p>The reactive step training sessions were undertaken at NeuRA in weeks 4 and 8. Both sessions were 60 minutes long, supervised, and focused on balance recovery from 12 trips and 12 slips with progressive unpredictability. Each session consisted of 5 blocks of 6 trials (trips, slips, and washouts). The training was conducted on a 10-m Trip and Slip Walkway consisting of 50 cm × 50 cm wooden decking tiles (<xref rid="fig1-15459683231206743" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Participants wore comfortable exercise shoes and clothes, a ceiling-mounted full-body harness, and protectors on the toes, shins, and knees. In previous studies, we found that many participants become cautious and reduce their gait speed when exposed to repeated trip and slip hazards.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="bibr46-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> To minimize between-participant variability in gait speed reduction due to anticipation of hazards, all participants performed the walking trials at approximately 81% of their usual gait speed. This was achieved by instructing participants to step on black and white target tiles positioned at 90% of their usual step length and a metronome set to 90% of their usual cadence. These usual gait parameters were based on a baseline walk over a 5-m electronic walkway (GAITRite mat, v4.0, 2010 CIR Systems). Trips were induced using a 14 cm height tripping board that flipped up from the walkway at mid-swing, cued by a hidden foot detection sensor. Slips were induced using a movable tile on 2 undetectable low-friction rails with linear bearings that could slide forward up to 40 cm on foot contact. Both the slipping tile and the tripping board were undetectable and could be positioned at various locations along the walkway to minimize predictive behaviors while training reactive stepping responses.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="bibr32-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr33-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> At the end of each training block, participants provided ratings of their anxiety and perceived difficulty using 5-point Likert scales.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> If these ratings indicated excessive anxiety or difficulty, gait speed (50%-80%) and slip distance (10-40 cm) in the following training block were reduced in consultation with each participant.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>A blinded investigator conducted the statistical analyses according to a published statistical analysis plan (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.osf.io/s89zx" ext-link-type="uri">www.osf.io/s89zx</ext-link>). Student <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests (continuous data), Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> tests (non-parametric data), and Chi-square tests (categorical data) were used for group comparisons at baseline. General linear models were used to examine between-group differences at reassessments while controlling for baseline scores for continuous outcomes (stepping, gait, sensorimotor, balance, cognition, and concern about falling). For gait adaptability, participant height was also entered as a covariate. Poisson regression was used with laboratory falls as a dependent variable, group as an independent variable, and the number of perturbations as an offset for the reassessment. Negative binomial regression was used to test for differences in the rate of falls in daily life between groups with the follow-up period in months entered as the exposure measure (offset). Extreme outlier scores (e.g. 5SD) were replaced with ±3SD from the average data.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Data missing at random (6.37% of data) were imputed using multiple imputations with 50 datasets.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> We set significance levels at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05.

                <p>Fifty-two participants who met the initial eligibility criteria determined via screening questions administered during a telephone call were invited for baseline assessment. Eight participants were subsequently excluded due to scheduling issues (n = 2), use of a Duodopa pump (due to the risk of damaging the intestinal tube resulting from falls into the safety harness; n = 1), being unable to follow assessment protocols (n = 4) or declining to participate further (n = 2). Thus, 44 participants were enrolled and randomized to the intervention (n = 22) or control (n = 22) groups (<xref rid="fig3-15459683231206743" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). No significant between-group differences were found in the demographic measures, clinical characteristics, and physical and mobility measures at baseline (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/15459683231206743" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Material 1</ext-link>). Nine participants were not assessed for reactive balance in the trip and slip perturbations protocol due to health concerns (e.g. foot pain, shoulder injury, and anxiety).</p>

                <p>Of the 22 intervention participants, 17 (77%) completed at least 75% of the prescribed dose of volitional stepping training. Median (interquartile range) weekly adherence for months 1, 2, and 3 were 81.8 (60.3), 81.8 (83.6), and 77.3 (53.5) minutes/week, respectively. Seventeen participants (77%) completed the 2 reactive-step training sessions. Four participants (18%) did not participate in 1 reactive step training session due to illness, ankle sprain, or hip and shoulder pain unrelated to the study, and 1 participant (5%) withdrew before any training due to illness.</p>

                <p>No participants fell during the home-based volitional step training. One participant felt knee discomfort during volitional step training that resolved after a 1-week training break. One participant felt increased hip pain (due to a car accident the previous week), and 1 reported high anxiety, requiring early termination of reactive step training.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The study findings suggest that a program comprising home-based volitional step training and reactive step training can improve balance recovery and voluntary stepping reaction times and errors in people with PD. At the end of the 12-week program, the intervention group experienced fewer laboratory-induced total falls in the laboratory, demonstrated faster step movement times in the cognitively challenging stepping tests and made fewer stepping errors in the SST. These findings indicate that people with PD can learn important motor skills related to fall prevention.</p>
              <p>The participants randomized to the intervention arm received both voluntary and reactive step training, so it is not possible to determine whether specific intervention components led to improvements in the outcome measures observed. However, with this caveat, the following 2 discussion points are proffered in line with the construct of task specificity in that improved performance likely relates to the task practiced.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p>
              <p>First, our study builds on a previous trial<sup><xref rid="bibr42-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> that implemented a 12-week home-based step training intervention (1 exergame with a minimum dose of three 15-minute sessions per week) that found CSRT improved only in participants with lower disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr 1-3). It is possible that increased emphasis on executive function factors such as selective attention and inhibition, greater recommended dose, and better adherence to the home-based voluntary step training program led to improved step movement times and reduced errors in the CSRT, iCSRT, and SST found in the current study. These are encouraging findings given that poor performances in these tests are predictors of falls in older people<sup><xref rid="bibr54-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> and people with PD.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In a similar vein, the reactive step training component likely improved balance recovery, as evidenced by fewer laboratory-induced falls in the intervention group relative to the control group. This is consistent with previous studies reporting short-term positive outcomes from reactive balance training in people with PD. For example, Barajas and Peterson<sup><xref rid="bibr20-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> found that 2 days of training involving repeated anterior platform surface translations improved the margin of stability during balance recovery from an unexpected perturbation test. In addition, Peterson et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> found that a program of 25 forward and 25 backward translations of the support surface improved postural responses in people with PD, and the adaptations were maintained for 24 hours. Our study builds on this work by demonstrating that a low dose of reactive step training involving repeated trips and slips may enhance balance recovery responses over 3 months.</p>
              <p>A strength of our study was the inclusion of various engaging step training games that provided player feedback, reinforcement, and rewards, which likely contributed to good adherence. The trips and slip perturbations used in our reactive step training had high ecological validity. They were highly analogous to trip and slip-falls experienced in daily life by people with PD.<sup><xref rid="bibr55-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Our current trial also offered valuable insights into the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of a combined volitional and reactive step training intervention for people with PD. However, while our study suggests the potential application of such a training paradigm, more development is required to maximize participant acceptability and adherence, and it would be preferable if reactive step training could be implemented in a clinic with minimal equipment.</p>
              <p>We also acknowledge some study limitations. First, we did not conduct the laboratory-fall assessment on 9 participants due to concerns regarding their health. Thus, our results are biased toward healthier participants who could undertake this assessment. Second, as indicated above, the study design precluded us from teasing out the effects of individual components of the combined program. Future studies could examine the positive impacts of combined voluntary and reactive balance training versus voluntary and reactive balance training administered as single interventions. Third, our primary study outcomes were restricted to falls following the trip and slip perturbations. Future studies could include complementary kinematic and electromyography measures of balance recovery ability, such as the margin of stability, trunk sway, step height<sup><xref rid="bibr47-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and muscle activation latency.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-15459683231206743" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Fourth, we had less contact with control participants compared with intervention participants during the trial. These observations indicate strong task-specificity and limited transferability from the step training to other performance outcomes. There was also no indication from our pilot data that the intervention reduced falls in daily life over 6 months (the 95% confidence interval for the incident rate ratio contrasting the group’s fall rates was too large to make any meaningful conclusions in this regard). This may indicate that training programs should specifically address some of our secondary outcome measures known as risk factors for falls (balance, strength, cognition, and gait adaptability) in addition to voluntary and reactive step training in a multifactorial fall prevention intervention. It is also possible that the reactive step training dose (two 60-minute sessions) was insufficient for some participants, and additional training sessions may be beneficial. Future studies could consider more tailored reactive step training and the optimal doses of the 2 types of stepping training.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>A combined volitional and reactive step training can improve balance recovery from an induced-perturbation, step movement time, and reduce errors in cognitively challenging stepping tests in people with PD. The training appeared to impact fall avoidance from slips more than trips in the laboratory. Larger trials powered for prospective falls in daily life are required to determine whether combined volitional and reactive balance training can prevent falls in daily life in this population.</p>
