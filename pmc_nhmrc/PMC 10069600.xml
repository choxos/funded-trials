                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>For children with cerebral palsy (CP), who are marginally ambulant, gross motor capacity peaks between 6 and 7 years of age with a subsequent clinical decline, impacting their ability to engage in physical activity. Active Strides-CP is a novel package of physiotherapy targeting body functions, activity and participation outcomes for children with bilateral CP. This study will compare Active Strides-CP to usual care in a multisite randomised waitlist-controlled trial.</p>

                  <p>150 children with bilateral CP (5–15 years), classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III and IV will be stratified (GMFCS III vs IV, age 5–10 years; 11–15 years and trial site) and randomised to receive either (1) 8 weeks of Active Strides-CP two times/week for 1.5 hours in clinic and one time/week for 1 hour alternating home visits and telehealth (total dose=32 hours) or (2) usual care. Active Strides-CP comprises functional electrical stimulation cycling, partial body weight support treadmill training, overground walking, adapted community cycling and goal-directed training. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, immediately post-intervention at 9 weeks <italic toggle="yes">primary endpoint</italic> and at 26 weeks post-baseline for retention. The primary outcome is the Gross Motor Function Measure-66. Secondary outcomes include habitual physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, walking speed and distance, frequency/involvement of community participation, mobility, goal attainment and quality of life. Analyses will follow standard principles for randomised controlled trials using two-group comparisons on all participants on an intention-to-treat basis. Comparisons between groups for primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted using regression models. A within-trial cost utility analysis will be performed.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In Australia, 420 infants are born annually with cerebral palsy (CP), making it the most common physical disability in childhood and the fifth most costly health condition ($A1.47 billion per annum, average yearly costs $A43 431 per individual).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Of these infants, 34% will have moderate-to-severe motor physical disability (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) III to V) which is associated with reduced general health, greater pain and discomfort,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> reduced independence in daily life skills,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> restricted participation in physical activity<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and poorer vocational outcomes.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Gross motor capacity for children classified as GMFCS level III peaks at a mean age of 7 years 11 months, and GMFCS IV peaks at 6 years 11 months, with a subsequent clinically significant decline thereafter.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> For marginally ambulant children with CP (uses walker or crutches) and non-ambulant (uses wheelchair), the decline in physical functioning over time means up to 87–96% of each waking day can be spent sitting.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Interventions to reduce physical disability and promote independence in daily life skills, inclusion and community participation are major research priority areas identified by consumers.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Traditional neurodevelopmental interventions, based on passive movement experiences and with the concept of ‘normalisation’ are ineffective in improving motor outcomes for children with CP.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Our International Clinical Practice Guideline of Functional Therapy<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and systematic review<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> identified that to improve walking speed and distance, over ground walking is recommended and can be supplemented with treadmill training (with/without partial body weight support). Cycling training may additionally improve muscle strength, gross motor function, metabolic health and cardiorespiratory fitness.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Task-specific training of self-selected gross motor goals such as sit-to-stand and transfers, appear promising to improve attainment of individualised goals.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The majority of current evidence to support intensive rehabilitation, is however, for children with mild-to-moderate CP (GMFCS I–II), with more limited data for improved motor capacity in children classified GMFCS III–IV.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Evidence indicates that motor learning-based interventions for children with CP need to be intensive, specific, repetitive, incremental and challenging in order to improve motor performance.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> There is little evidence, however, to suggest that targeting motor capacity alone will have a downstream impact on children’s participation in community-based physical activity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>Children with CP participate less frequently and in fewer types of physically active leisure compared with their typically developing peers.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> With increasing severity of motor impairment, there are less opportunities and children with CP participate in even fewer physically active leisure pursuits.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These children are at a greater risk of physical inactivity with more time spent sedentary and less time engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The natural history of decline in gross motor function with age, particularly for children GMFCS III and IV,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> further compounds this problem. Models of rehabilitation that address personal, contextual and environmental barriers to participation, may be more effective in enabling participation in physically active leisure and increasing levels of physical activity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Embedding rehabilitation in context and supporting children and families to integrate active practice of their gross motor and leisure goals into their daily routines is essential for the long-term maintenance of treatment gains and ongoing participation.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>Results from two pilot randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have informed the development of a new intervention called Active Strides-CP for children classified in GMFCS III and IV. A package of functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling, goal-directed training and recreational cycling was compared with usual care (UC) in a single-blind waitlist RCT for school-aged children with CP (GMFCS II–IV).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Twenty-one children were randomly allocated to either an intervention group, who received 24 hours of intensive FES cycling, goal-directed training and recreational cycling or a control group who received UC. The intervention group had significant and clinically meaningful gains in gross motor capacity on the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66, mean difference (MD)=5.9; 95% CI 3.1 to 8.8; p&lt;0.001), achievement of goals on the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM, MD=4.4; 95% CI 3.9 to 5.3; p&lt;0.001) and higher levels of pedalling resistance during FES cycling (MD=3.4; 95% CI 1.0 to 5.8; p=0.009) immediately post-training compared with the waitlist group.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Additionally, recreational adapted cycling provided children with CP an enjoyable option for longer-term participation in physically active leisure.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> In a second RCT, FES robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) plus goal-directed overground walking in gait trainers was compared with partial body weight-supported treadmill training (PBWSTT) plus goal-directed overground walking in gait trainers.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Forty children in GMFCS III to V were randomly allocated to 18 hours of either intensive FES RAGT and overground walking (n=20), or PBWSTT and overground walking (n=20). The findings supported a non-differential effect on gross motor function, walking speed, burden of care and goal attainment.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Both interventions demonstrated significant improvements in all outcomes over time at both the 6-week post intervention and 6-month follow-up compared with baseline suggesting that FES RAGT and goal-directed overground walking were not more effective than PBWSTT and goal-directed overground walking. The PBWSTT group had significant improvements in gross motor capacity on the GMFM-66 (MD 2.2; 95% CI 0.8 to 3.5; p=0.001), walking speed on the 10-metre walk test (MD 0.6 s; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.8; p=0.002), goal attainment on the Goal Attainment Scale (post intervention: MD 22.3; 95% CI 17.6 to 27; p&lt;0.001) and perceived goal performance on the COPM (MD 3.3; 95% CI 2.5 to 4; p&lt;0.001) and when compared with baseline.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This study demonstrated that simplified equipment using PBWSTT and goal-directed overground walking using gait trainers was effective and feasible in non-ambulant children with CP to improve gross motor function, walking speed, goal attainment, performance and satisfaction and reduced burden of care.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
              <p>In our new Active Strides-CP study, we combine the effective elements of both pilot RCTs in a programme of physiotherapy which combines (1) FES cycling; (2) PBWST; (3) goal-directed training; (4) overground walking and (5) adapted community recreational cycling, with the additional consideration of environmental barriers to participation.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We propose that these elements will complementarily work together to facilitate children attaining individualised motor and leisure goals, and overarching motor, physical activity and participation outcomes.</p>

                <p>This single-blind multisite RCT will investigate whether an 8-week Active Strides-CP intervention compared with UC will lead to greater changes in gross motor function immediately post intervention for school-age children with moderate-to-severe CP (GMFCS III, IV). Secondary outcomes will include habitual physical activity ((HPA), time spent sedentary, time in light and/or MVPA), cardiorespiratory fitness (heart rate/Physiological Cost Index (HR/PCI)), walking speed and distance, frequency/involvement of community participation, mobility performance, attainment of gross motor goals, healthcare use and quality of life immediately post intervention and with retention of outcomes 6 months post-baseline.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>Active Strides-CP is a pragmatic, single assessor-blind randomised controlled, multicentre trial with two parallel groups. The primary time point is immediately post-intervention (9 weeks post-baseline) and the secondary time point is 18 weeks post-intervention (26 weeks post-baseline). The study will be conducted in four Australian cities across five sites, Brisbane (Queensland Children’s Hospital; n=40), Sydney (Cerebral Palsy Alliance; n=40), Melbourne (Royal Children’s Hospital and Monash Hospital; n=40) and Perth (Healthy Strides Foundation; n=30). Randomisation will be stratified according to GMFCS (III or IV) and age bands (5–10 and 11–15 years), then randomised centrally (Queensland site) to receive either Active Strides-CP or UC using an electronic allocation system determined by non-study personnel via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Children allocated to UC will receive Active Strides-CP after the 26-week follow-up assessment.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Participants eligible for the trial must comply with all of the following eligibility criteria at randomisation: (1) diagnosis of bilateral CP (diplegia/quadriplegia) and classified in GMFCS levels III or IV; (2) between 5–15 years; (3) have goals to improve community mobility and cycling; (4) able to attend training, testing and follow-up sessions; (5) able and willing to follow instructions to perform study assessments and intervention (as determined by the assessor at baseline); (6) not expected to undergo lower limb orthopaedic or neurosurgery (eg, selective dorsal rhizotomy) during the study period. If they have received lower limb orthopaedic surgery then study entry will be delayed until they are 12 months post-surgery; (7) medically fit to undertake moderate intensity exercise; (8) adequate range of motion (ROM) in their hips, knees and ankles to complete a full revolution of the crank arm; and (9) able to verbally or non-verbally communicate pain or discomfort.</p>
                <p>Participants will be excluded if the child has: (1) lower limb joint contracture, severe spasticity or severely reduced ROM that limits the ability to complete a full cycling revolution; (2) uncontrolled epilepsy (not controlled by medication) as this would be a confounder; (3) surgery, trauma or fractures in the preceding 12 months without medical clearance to participate; (4) cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases without medical clearance to participate in the 8-week intervention.</p>

FES stimulation parameters are adjusted based on the participant’s tolerance.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–27</xref> Muscle groups include bilateral gluteal, hamstring, quadriceps, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. Global starting frequency of 40–50Hz FES stimulation is used for all muscle groups.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A frequency of 50 Hz falls close to the beginning of the plateau of the force-frequency curve for the quadriceps and hamstrings of children with CP.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 28</xref></p>
                  <p>A cycling sprint test will be completed at the initial FES-cycling session to determine the participant’s target power outputs for the cycling protocol. Participants will complete three, 10-s sprints on the cycle ergometer (no stimulation or motor support) and the peak power output will be recorded from the ergometer’s display panel. Participants will begin cycling at a comfortable speed for 10–30 s with resistance set at the minimal level of 0.5 Nm. If participants can cycle faster than 20 rpm or if they feel as though their feet are flying off the pedals, resistance will be increased to a level that is comfortable. Participants will then be asked to cycle as hard and as fast as possible for three 10 s sprints, separated by 30 s of passive cycling. The peak power output achieved during the sprints will be used to determine the target training power output for the first training session. In subsequent sessions, the sprint resistance and target power output will be calculated based on the highest peak power and resistance achieved during the previous cycling session. If participants require motor support to initiate or maintain a constant pedalling motion, the power output reflects the amount of work completed by the individual above the level of assistance provided by the motor.</p>

Level of weight support will be adjusted to maximise bilateral lower limb weight bearing and facilitate ease of foot clearance during the swing phase of gait. Each set comprises of facilitated stepping (2 min) followed by independent stepping (30 s). During the 2-min facilitated stepping, initial body weight support will be provided at 60% of the child’s body weight at a speed that matches the child’s 10-metre fast walk test (10mFWT) speed. Facilitation is provided by a physiotherapist and therapy assistant positioned either side of the child. Standardised hand positioning will be adopted during the swing and stance phase. Speed will increase by 0.1 km/hour increments at a time. If the participant is able to maintain foot clearance during the swing phase of gait and heart rate remaining below 70% of maximum, speed can be increased by 0.1 km/hour at a time. If the walking speed is limited to 0.8 km/hour (the lowest speed in many commercial treadmills), body weight support will be increased by 10% at a time to enable foot clearance during the swing phase of gait. After the 2 min of facilitated stepping, the child will then be asked to generate independent stepping without facilitation for 30-s intervals with the treadmill speed set to match their overground walking speed (measured by their 10mFWT) with body weight support remaining the same as the proceeding 2-min interval. During the 30-s independent stepping interval, verbal prompts and props will be used to encourage consistent stepping and timing of steps. The aim in this interval is to reduce body weight support by 10% at a time while maintaining the set speed. If the child is able to maintain stepping with only 10% body weight support, the speed can then be increased by 0.1 km/hour. During the rest break between 10-min sets, children will be encouraged to stand as actively as possible while engaged in a play activity.</p>

                  <p>The remainder of the training session will be dedicated to practice of overground walking and reviewing and progressing the goal-directed HEP described below.</p>
                  <p>HR response will be monitored in each clinical session to determine target training intensity (set to 70% maximum HR) using a Polar M600 HR wrist monitor or Polar Verity Sense Optical Heart Rate Monitor. The HR wrist monitor will be applied at the commencement of the session to capture HR response throughout the FES cycling, PBWSTT and goal-directed training. If heart rate exceeds the 70% maximum HR, body weight support will be decreased by 10% at a time.</p>

                  <p>On week one of the 8-week programme, a home visit will be conducted using client-centred problem-solving style of communication such as Motivational Interviewing. Two to three functional goals with a focus on mobility and/or recreational cycling will have been set as part of the baseline assessment process using the COPM.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The goals will align to either the Activity or Participation domain of the ICF. The domain of the goal/s will be recorded. An example of an Activity goal might be ‘to independently mount adapted cycle with supervision’. The goals should have the following features to ensure that they are appropriate, specific and repeatable (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

                    <p>The cycling component will be completed using adapted tricycles or recumbent bikes. The adapted recreational cycling aims to bridge the gap between commencing cycling in a clinical setting (FES cycling which aims to build capacity of cycling speed and endurance) and translation to cycling in a community-based context. Therapists will work with families prior to entry to the study to secure their own adapted bike. If participants do not own their own bike and helmet, each site will have a small number of available bikes that can be loaned to the family for the duration of the study. Additional bikes or attachments such as backrests, adapted pedals and handlebars may be sourced on a case-by-case basis if an appropriate bike is not available in the existing equipment pool. Participants will continue to have access to loan bikes during the retention period (T2–T3). The cycling component will take place in a safe area that is identified by the family and therapist at the initial home visit. If there are no safe places to cycle near the participants home, participants will be encouraged to transport their bike to a local bike path or park.</p>

                    <p>Overground walking will be completed with the support of the child’s own assistive mobility device. For children classified within GMFCS level III, equipment may include elbow crutches or a gait trainer with limited body support. The aim for overground walking in children classified within GMFCS level III may be to develop more functionally independent walking within indoor and outdoor environments, steps or stairs. For children classified within GMFCS level IV, suitable equipment may include supportive gait trainers. The aim of overground walking is for task-specific practice which may include transfers (in and out of their walker), walking in indoor environments or walking in busier cluttered environments that require steering and negotiating obstacles. The principle of overground walking is whole task practice within environmentally relevant contexts. A ‘hands-off’ approach will be adopted to encourage the child to initiate their own movements. Occasional guidance and support may, however, be provided to demonstrate strategies to turn and steer in the walker or to provide feedback when experiencing new movements. Incremental challenges will be introduced throughout the 8 weeks. This includes reducing physical support within the gait trainer, increasing resistance on the gait trainer, reducing physical or verbal prompts for stepping or increasing the variability of practice such as introducing obstacles, visual clutter or altered surfaces as directed by the goals set by the child and their family.</p>
                    <p>Participants will record in a diary the amount of time spent each week on goal-directed training, cycling and walking training.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Families with a child meeting eligibility will be invited to join at four collaborating sites (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia) and associated clinical services (Queensland Children’s Hospital, Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Healthy Strides Foundation, Royal Children’s Hospital and Monash Hospital). Recruitment from five major centres will enable the target sample size to be achieved. As there are a predicted 500 children with moderate-to-severe CP (Australian CP Register), aged 5–15 years, recruitment of 150 children is feasible. The CIs have achieved high recruitment and retention in RCTs of school-aged children with moderate-to-severe CP.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p>
                <p>Recruitment at each site will commence once ethical and governance approvals have been obtained. The first participant was enrolled and randomised on 1 August 2022 and the study is expected to be complete by 30 June 2026. Recruitment will draw on current databases within each organisation, referrals from clinical services and the respective State Cerebral Palsy Registers. Contact with participants will occur via one of the following mechanisms:</p>

                <title>Allocation and blinding (masking)</title>
                <p>Participants will be randomly assigned to either Active Strides-CP or UC with a 1:1 allocation as per a computer-generated randomisation schedule using the REDCap randomisation module, stratiﬁed by GMFCS (III or IV), age bands (5–10, 11–15) and site, using permuted blocks of four to six random sizes. The allocation sequence will be generated and entered by a biostatistician not otherwise involved in recruitment, assessment, or trial conduct. Randomisation will occur after enrolment and completion of all baseline assessments (except for 7-day HPA monitoring). Participants and therapists delivering the intervention will not be blinded to intervention after baseline assessments, as it will not be possible to maintain blinding while they are delivering the intervention. All objective outcome measures will be performed by outcome assessors (physiotherapists and/or exercise physiologists) blind to treatment allocation. A detailed assessment manual will be provided to all assessors outlining the order and administration requirements of each measure. Participants and caregivers will be asked to not divulge their group assignment. Participants and groups will be given a numerical identifier in the data set, which will not be revealed to statisticians and CIs until analysis is completed.</p>

                  <p>The primary basis for sample size calculation is adequate power for H<sup>1</sup> comparison between functional effects of Active Strides-CP compared with UC immediately post intervention. Based on data from two pilot RCTs, we propose a mean difference of 7 logit points (100-Logit Scale)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> on the GMFM-66 as the minimum difference likely to have substantial clinical impact.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 22</xref> Data from our two pilot RCTs yielded a pooled SD of 14 logits.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 22</xref> To detect a between-group difference of 7 logits or greater on the GMFM-66 with 80% power we require 64 children in each group (alpha=0.05). Based on previous RCTs conducted by our group we anticipate a maximum drop-out between randomisation and T2 of 15%,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> consequently, we will aim to recruit 150 children in total (75 in each group).</p>

                  <title>Statistical methods to be undertaken</title>
                  <p>Primary comparison is a between-group comparison of GMFM-66 scores post treatment at 9 weeks. Groups will be compared using linear regression with group (intervention/UC) as the main effect and baseline GMFM-66 scores included as the covariable. For secondary outcomes, we will use similar methods to compare between groups post intervention for continuous outcomes (linear regression), binary outcomes (logistic regression) and count outcomes (Poisson regression). When data from multiple time points is analysed, mixed-effects regression models will be constructed. They will include participant as a random effect to account for non-independence of observations from the same child. Where continuous data exhibit skewness not overcome by transformation, non-parametric methods such as median regression will be used. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using imputation techniques to investigate missing data during follow-up. Analyses will follow standard principles for RCTs using two-group comparisons on all subjects on an intention-to-treat basis.</p>

                  <title>Risk management and safety</title>
                  <p>The main risk to this project is recruitment shortfalls and participant attrition. Importantly, we have access to large state-wide populations of school-aged children with bilateral CP throughout Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia from state-wide rehabilitation services and the NSW/ACT Cerebral Palsy Register.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> High recruitment is expected as all children receive the intervention either immediately or after the waitlist UC period. Should further lockdowns occur due to COVID-19, these are likely to be isolated to specific areas/states, therefore having four sites enables recruitment to continue in other sites should one be restricted due to COVID-19. In the event that children miss sessions due to COVID-19 or other illnesses, attempts will be made to reschedule as many missed sessions as possible within the allocated 8-week intervention period.</p>
                  <p>All staff involved in delivering the intervention will be trained and supervised by senior experienced personnel. Regular daily monitoring will occur and any discomfort reported by the child or their caregiver will be immediately responded to.</p>
                  <p>The ActiGraph GT3X+, Axivity 3AX and Polar OH1 Optical HR devices pose no health and safety risks and do not cause pain or harm to participants when infection control procedures are followed (disinfection of devices and straps between uses and participants). Discomfort could be caused by tight application or contact allergic reactions to cleaning fluid. This will be monitored closely with verbal prompting, and visual checking of devices and skin contact twice a day. Families will be provided with an information sheet and brief counselling on the risks associated with wearing accelerometers, with a focus on preventing the development of pressure areas, early identification of allergic skin reactions and reducing unpleasant sensations. Children will be monitored during each clinic session about comfort/discomfort of the FES electrodes.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>There is a paucity of evidence for effective interventions to improve motor outcomes and community participation for children with moderate-to-severe bilateral CP (who cannot stand and/or walk without gait aids). For these children, high intensity gait and cycling training has recently been shown to improve gross motor function and mobility,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but it is not known if this leads to improved participation in home and community life, including physically active leisure.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We have developed and pilot-tested new treatment approaches for children with moderate-to-severe bilateral CP and now propose a package of training which combines effective elements of intensive gait (iStride),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and cycling and goal directed training (ACTIVATE-CP)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> that complementarily work together to attain individualised motor and leisure goals, and overarching motor and participation outcomes.</p>
              <p>One potential limitation of the study is that there may be interruptions to the protocol due to COVID-related illness of participants and/or staff. To address this, we will maintain the 8-week intervention period, but offer make up sessions if possible to account for missing sessions. All variations will be recorded. UC will be variable and it is not possible to standardise given the multitude of different service providers under pre-agreed funding packages through the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme. We will record the type and dose of standard care to enable reporting in as much detail as possible.</p>
              <p>The study has a number of strengths. The sample size has been calculated for the primary outcome and the inclusion of five different recruitment sites across Australia will ensure that recruitment is feasible. We have included outcome measures with reported and validity and reliability for our population of interest. We have a comprehensive fidelity framework including standardised training of intervention providers, manualisation of the assessment and intervention protocols, that in combination with a within trial cost utility analysis will provide important information to inform future translation of the intervention into clinical practice. We plan that the results of this RCT will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences.</p>
