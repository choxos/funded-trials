                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Most simple undisplaced fractures can be managed without surgery by immobilising the limb with a splint, prescribing medication for pain, and providing advice and early rehabilitation. Recent systematic reviews based on retrospective observational studies have reported that virtual fracture clinics can deliver follow-up care that is safe and cost-effective. However, no randomised controlled trial has investigated if a virtual fracture clinic can provide non-inferior physical function outcomes compared with an in-person clinic for patients with simple fractures.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>312 participants will be recruited from 2 metropolitan hospitals located in Sydney, Australia. Adult patients will be eligible if they have an acute simple fracture that can be managed with a removable splint and is deemed appropriate for follow-up at either the virtual or in-person fracture clinic by an orthopaedic doctor. Patients will not be eligible if they have a complex fracture that requires a cast or surgery. Eligible participants will be randomised to receive their follow-up care either at the virtual or the in-person fracture clinic. Participants at the virtual fracture clinic will be reviewed within 5 days of receiving a referral through video calls with a physiotherapist. Participants at the in-person fracture clinic will be reviewed by an orthopaedic doctor within 7–10 days of receiving a referral. The primary outcome will be the patient’s function measured using the Patient-Specific Functional Scale at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include health-related quality of life, patient-reported experiences, pain, health cost, healthcare utilisation, medication use, adverse events, emergency department representations and surgery.</p>

                  <p>The study has been approved by the Sydney Local Health District Ethics Review Committee (RPAH Zone) (X23-0200 and 2023/ETH01038). The trial results will be submitted for publication in a reputable international journal and will be presented at professional conferences.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In 2019, there were 178 million new fractures reported globally, an increase of 33.4% since 1990.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Australia, the treatment costs of osteoporosis-related fractures were estimated to be $A2.34 billion in 2017.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> With increasing numbers of people requiring care for their fractures, the burden on outpatient fracture clinics has also increased, causing long clinic wait times and productivity losses.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> The recent pandemic further strengthens the requirement for health system efficiency.</p>
              <p>Most simple fractures, including minimally displaced fractures, can be managed conservatively without surgery. These stable fractures are managed with short-term immobilisation, advice, pain relieving medication and early rehabilitation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Traditional physical assessments at an outpatient clinic may not be required for conditions that have a clear prognosis and have been shown to recover well with conservative management.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Published studies have shown that virtual fracture clinics (VFCs) can manage patients with simple fractures.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Patients receive advice and management through phone calls and written handouts, rather than attending the outpatient clinic in person. Retrospective observational studies have reported that VFCs are associated with good patient satisfaction, increased cost efficiency for the hospital system, fewer adverse events and reduced presentations to in-person clinics.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Despite a rise in VFCs since the recent pandemic, robust evaluations of their safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are lacking. A recent systematic review of 21 publications suggested that VFCs could provide safe and cost-effective care to patients with acute fractures, though none of the included studies were randomised controlled trials.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It is currently unknown whether VFCs produce non-inferior outcomes compared with in-person care for patients with simple fractures.</p>
              <p>We have designed a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a VFC for patients with simple fractures. The primary outcome of this trial is physical function at 12-week follow-up, measured using the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). Secondary outcomes will include health-related quality of life, patient-reported experiences, pain, health cost, healthcare utilisation, medication use, adverse events, emergency department (ED) representations and surgery. A qualitative substudy will be conducted to explore the experiences, feelings and expectations of patients who use the VFC.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>The Fracture Clinic Trial (RECITAL) is a prospective two-arm, parallel group randomised controlled trial, using a non-inferiority design with nested economic and process evaluations. We chose a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial design as both study groups are existing hospital services, and the VFC is expected to have outcomes that are at least no worse than the in-person fracture clinic. This trial has been prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12623000934640). This document describes the trial protocol according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials 2013 Statement.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Recruitment began in November 2023, with the final data collection expected to occur in November 2025.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>RECITAL will compare two existing models of care provided at two metropolitan public hospitals within Sydney Local Health District (SLHD) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The VFC (intervention group) is located at Royal Prince Alfred (RPA) Virtual Hospital (<bold>rpa</bold>virtual), while the in-person fracture clinic (control group) is situated at the RPA Hospital. <bold>rpa</bold>virtual is Australia’s first virtual hospital established in February 2020 to enable patients to receive hospital-level care at home through virtual means (eg, video calls or remote monitoring), rather than visiting the traditional hospital for their healthcare needs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Patients referred to the VFC (eg, from local emergency departments, general practices or the in-person fracture clinic) will be identified and screened by a VFC physiotherapist and an orthopaedic doctor to determine if the patient is suitable for either model of care (virtual or in-person). The RECITAL study staff will contact eligible patients to invite them into this study. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the trial design.</p>

                <p>People with any type of simple fracture that is deemed appropriate for virtual care will be eligible for the trial, to reflect usual practice. The most common types of fracture are expected to be base of fifth metatarsal, ankle Weber A, and Mason I radial head. Uncommon types of simple fracture could include greater tuberosity or clavicle. Patients who consent to participate and complete their baseline measures will be enrolled in this study. Informed consent (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>) and study data will be collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool hosted at SLHD.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> The randomisation schedule will be computer-generated using REDCap’s randomisation model and will be stratified in random blocks of 4, 6, 8 and 10 to ensure equal numbers in both groups and concealed allocation. A biostatistician not involved in this study will set up the allocation schedule and upload it into REDCap. Only the biostatistician will be aware of the allocation to ensure concealment. The study coordinator will randomise the patients to the study groups. Participants randomised to the VFC who agree to participate in the qualitative substudy will be purposively selected for an interview according to their age, employment status, tertiary education level, type of injury and discharge status. Selected participants will be contacted once they are discharged from the clinic to ensure their complete experience with the VFC is captured.</p>

                <title>VFC (intervention group)</title>
                <p>Patients randomised to the VFC (intervention) group will be contacted via phone and email to organise an initial follow-up with a physiotherapist; usually within 5 days after their referral is received. Patients are sent an email with their appointment details and a fracture management fact sheet. The fact sheet explains their clinical condition, expected recovery, early rehabilitation exercises, activity limitations and information on care escalation. These fact sheets were adapted with permission from Royal Melbourne Hospital’s VFC.</p>
                <p>All patients are offered a video consultation with a physiotherapist unless they choose to have their review via phone. During the virtual consults, the physiotherapist conducts an assessment, discusses the X-ray findings and provides a management plan. The virtual consult sessions are usually approximately 30 min. An email summary of the consultation and follow-up appointment details are sent to the patient after the consultation. A Physitrack link may also be included in this email. Physitrack or PhysiApp is an internet-based programme that allows patients to view videos of their prescribed exercises. Patients are usually offered a follow-up virtual appointment at 2 weeks and 6 weeks post-fracture, or based on clinical need. Patients can contact the physiotherapist out of session if they have any concerns during their care period. Most patients are discharged from the VFC at 6 weeks post-fracture if there are no concerns. Patients will be supported with an interpreter, Aboriginal Cultural Support Team or with loaned devices and data as required. For example, although many older patients (aged 60+) currently use the virtual service, a digital patient navigator can assist patients and provide a smart phone with data so they can attend their virtual clinic appointments. We will monitor patient adherence by the number of consults attended; and the number of ad hoc patient contacts via phone or email with the clinic.</p>

                <title>In-person fracture clinic (control group)</title>
                <p>Patients randomised to the in-person fracture clinic will be contacted via phone or email to provide a follow-up appointment. Appointments usually occur 7–10 days after the referral is received, based on the availability of the on-call orthopaedic doctor. Clinical management and subsequent follow-ups of the control group will be determined by the orthopaedic doctors at the in-person fracture clinic. Clinical management can include a physical assessment by a doctor, radiology scan, advice and exercises. A physiotherapist may be involved in the patient’s care. Patients in the control group may receive written instructions about their recovery and exercises as per current processes. The in-person consult sessions are usually approximately 20 min. Current practice suggests that patients may attend the in-person fracture clinic once or twice within 6 weeks post-fracture. We will monitor patient adherence by the number of consults attended.</p>
                <p>Staff providing care to study participants will be trained on the trial protocol and be regularly supported by study investigators to ensure adherence to study protocol.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome of this study will be the participant’s physical function assessed using the PSFS at 12 weeks. This self-reported tool has shown to be sensitive to change in patients with musculoskeletal problems, including simple fractures.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> Participants list up to five functional tasks at baseline and score their level of ability — 0 (unable to perform activity) to 10 (able to perform activity at the same level as before the injury). Scores for each activity will be summed and calculated as an average of the total possible score for the participant (determined by the number of identified activities). We will compare the PSFS average scores between groups at 12 weeks as our primary measure. <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises the outcome measures for this study.</p>

                <title>Primary analysis</title>
                <p>Non-inferiority trials assess whether an intervention outcome is not clinically worse than a control. The PSFS score at 12 weeks post-randomisation is the primary outcome in this study and we have prospectively defined a non-inferiority margin (ΔT) of −0.7 points, which is the maximum difference we are prepared to tolerate and still consider virtual care not to be clinically inferior to in-person care. The null hypothesis is, therefore, that a difference of greater than ΔT exists in favour of in-person care (H0: Δ ≤−ΔT). This will be assessed by creating a 95% CI, which should be entirely above the non-inferiority margin for the intervention to be declared non-inferior. The PSFS score will be compared between treatment groups as the dependent variable in a generalised linear regression model for the primary analysis adjusting for baseline PSFS variables. The treatment difference will be based on the estimate of adjusted means and 95% CIs.</p>

                  <p>We will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate the incremental-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) defined as: [cost of the virtual care−cost of in-person practice]/[effectiveness of the virtual care−effectiveness of in-person practice]. The effectiveness outcomes include PSFS, ED visit, rehospitalisation and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs for resource inputs will largely be derived from available local and national sources and estimated in line with best practice. Primary research using established accounting methods may also be required to estimate unit costs. Costs will be standardised to current prices where possible. The EQ-5D-5L outcomes will be used to generate QALYs, and the responses will be compared with the national Australian value set for the EQ-5D-5L.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Multiple imputation methods will be used to impute missing data and avoid biases associated with complete-case analysis.</p>
                  <p>To estimate the uncertainty of ICERs, bootstrapping will be used to resample corresponding costs and effectiveness that will be observed in RECITAL, and the distribution of ICERs calculated from all resamples will be plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane. Subgroup analysis will be carried out to assess the equity impact of the interventions. One-way sensitivity analysis will be conducted around key cost variables. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be plotted, which will provide information about the probability that an intervention is cost-effective, given the level of a decision maker’s willingness to pay for each additional effectiveness outcome gained. The economic assessment method will adhere to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 2022.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref></p>
