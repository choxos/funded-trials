The Australian Healthier Wealthier Families project seeks to reduce the childhood inequities caused by poverty and deprivation by creating a systematic referral pathway between two free, community-based services: universal, well-child nursing services, which provide health and development support to families with children from birth to school entry, and financial counselling. By adapting the successful Scottish ‚ÄòHealthier Wealthier Children‚Äô model, the objectives of this Australian pilot are to test the (1) <italic>feasibility</italic> of systematising the referral pathway, and (2) short-term <italic>impacts</italic> on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and financial service use.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This pilot randomised controlled trial will run in three sites across two Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales), recruiting a total of 180 participants. Nurses identify eligible caregivers with a 6-item, study-designed screening survey for financial hardship. Caregivers who report one or more risk factors and consent are randomised. The intervention is financial counselling. The comparator is usual care plus information from a government money advice website. Feasibility will be evaluated using the number/proportion of caregivers who complete screening, consent and research measures, and access financial counselling. Though powered to assess feasibility, impacts will be measured 6 months post-enrolment with qualitative interviews and questionnaires about caregiver-reported income, loans and costs (adapted from national surveys, for example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey); health (General Health Questionnaire 1, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale short-form); efficacy (from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children); and financial service use (study-designed) compared between arms.</p>

                <title>Childhood poverty and Australia‚Äôs social welfare system</title>
                <p>The first years of life are a critical developmental period when children living in or on the verge of poverty are the most vulnerable to its detrimental impacts on future health and well-being, cognitive development, educational attainment, employment and societal participation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, one in six Australian children was already living in poverty (defined as living below 50% of median household income), and one in three was deprived of basic health essentials like adequate fruits and vegetables.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3‚Äì6</xref> Ten per cent of children experienced multiple deprivations or were excluded from activities widely regarded as essential, such as medical and dental treatment, insurance, housing and emergency savings.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3‚Äì6</xref></p>
                <p>In April 2020, as a result of the government restrictions enacted to control the spread of COVID-19, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that 2.7 million Australians (almost 20% of the working population) lost their jobs or hours of work.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Many of these Australians are caregivers to young children who are disproportionately likely to experience multiple material deprivations.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This is especially true for children living in young or one-parent households, with an experience of disability or chronic disease, Aboriginal communities or families who do not speak English.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There is strong international evidence that household financial resources impact child health and development outcomes, although the underlying mechanisms are complex.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Protecting households from income poverty and increasing family finances are key strategies for promoting children‚Äôs opportunities and life chances.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
                <p>Australia has a complex social welfare system. Intended as a social safety net, it offers a range of support to families incorporating cash transfers, income support payments, tax concessions, and a variety of community services delivered by federal and state governments. This includes new (temporary) income benefits and services that were rapidly established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many families face barriers to entitlements, services and supports due to reasons including low financial literacy, lack of awareness of the assistance available, the complex application processes involved and the perceived stigma of receiving assistance.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> These families are also at risk of being targeted by high-cost and harmful debt services, gambling providers and pay-day lenders.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The failure of Australia‚Äôs policies and services to ameliorate childhood poverty is reflected in its prevalence, which has remained between 14% and 18% since the 1990s.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>

                <title>The potential benefits of financial counselling</title>
                <p>Financial counselling is a promising component of the Australian policy response to increase household income and reduce material deprivation. Services are available to low-income households at no cost through non-profit and community organisations, funded by state and federal governments.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Financial counsellors can help clients overcome barriers to the services and supports available by helping them understand their legal rights and entitlements, negotiate and manage debt, avoid bankruptcy, prevent litigation and, when necessary, referring to other services such as community legal aid, housing support or personal (eg, mental health), family (eg, violence) and gambling supports.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Some Australian financial counselling services also provide financial education to build an individual‚Äôs capacity to understand money and make sound financial decisions (eg, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
                <p>Clients of financial counselling in Australia report significant short-term benefits, such as debt consolidation and waivers, and uptake of welfare entitlements.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19</xref> A recent evaluation of a community non-profit service reported that over two-thirds of clients had avoided legal action, accessed creditor hardship programmes, and felt their financial situations and literacy had improved.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Importantly, 63% reported improvement in mental and emotional well-being, and 45% indicated that their relationships with their families and children had improved.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It is estimated that timely access to this assistance delivers a cost‚Äìbenefit of $5 saved for every $1 invested in financial counselling programmes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> International research shows that providing people with information about their eligibility for social welfare, and assistance navigating applications and services, can increase both the uptake of benefits and net income.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22‚Äì24</xref> Importantly, this assistance makes the greatest difference for the people experiencing the highest levels of social adversity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22‚Äì24</xref></p>
                <p>Despite these benefits, financial counselling remains a relatively niche service that is unknown to many Australians. Financial counsellors are different from financial planners, credit service providers or debt consolidators, who can recommend and sell specific financial products and charge fees for services. To legally practise, financial counsellors require accreditation membership with a state-based professional financial counselling association, and completion of a supervised training period and ongoing professional and personal development. Referrals to financial counselling are typically made from social workers in health organisations or by clients who gain awareness of the services and self-refer, and made during periods of acute financial crisis.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The services are not systematically linked with or integrated into other service platforms such as health or education, which means the sector is missing a critical opportunity for delivering much-needed preventative and early intervention financial support.</p>

                <title>Using healthcare to identify and respond to poverty and deprivation</title>
                <p>Healthcare is recognised as a promising avenue for identifying and responding to poverty and deprivation.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26‚Äì30</xref> Likewise, financial and money advice services offer potential for shifting the physical and mental health burdens that commonly occur with, and are exacerbated by, financial hardship.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In Scotland, the National Health Service in Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) has been championing the use of primary healthcare for promoting financial inclusion and reducing the structural inequities that lead to poor physical and mental health for families and children.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In 2010, the NHSGGC established the ‚ÄòHealthier Wealthier Children‚Äô (HWC) programme to create new information and referral pathways between the early years health workforce (midwives and health visitors) and money advice workers.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>
                <p>Initially, the HWC project was delivered in 10 Glasgow communities between November 2010 and March 2012, providing personalised financial counselling to pregnant women and families with young children, including information on welfare entitlements, income maximisation, debt reduction, savings accounts and mentored loans.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In 2012, HWC was evaluated for its economic and social impact. Of 2516 families referred, 1347 accessed the programme, and the resulting monetary gain for women and families totalled ¬£3 million. The authors reported positive spill-over effects including improved health, housing and quality of life.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Implementation of the service model has been sustained and integrated into the Scottish Government policy to reduce poverty since formal project closure in 2013. As of December 2019, the programme has resulted in a cumulative total of 24 470 referrals and ¬£34 699 481 total financial gain for women and families.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
                <p>The HWC model shows the increased income and well-being that a systematic referral pathway between healthcare and social welfare can generate for families and young children.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This is consistent with the broader body of literature showing that welfare advice and income maximisation programmes delivered through healthcare can create financial benefits for people with low income.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 35</xref> However, no studies have replicated the HWC model using universal healthcare for families with young children, and the model is yet to be rigorously evaluated via randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. Systematic reviews of the published literature highlight both the limited quantitative research investigating the impact of welfare advice on health and social outcomes,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35‚Äì37</xref> as well as the poor quality or lack of data investigating whether health services can be harnessed to change individuals‚Äô social or economic outcomes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 38</xref></p>

                <title>The current study</title>
                <p>To develop this evidence, the current study‚Äî‚ÄòHealthier Wealthier Families‚Äô (HWF)‚Äîwill adapt the Scottish HWC model for the Australian context by linking universal, community-based, well-child nursing services that specifically support families with young children from birth to school entry (known as Child and Family Health (CFH)) with community-based financial counselling services. Despite the well-established impacts of poverty on children‚Äôs lifelong health and well-being, no Australian CFH service at the state or territory level systematically asks about or responds to poverty or deprivation. The need for a universal response to financial hardship will only increase as the negative impacts of COVID-19 on family finances and mental health unfold.</p>
                <p>The study design is a pilot RCT comparing referral to a financial counselling service (the intervention) with money advice information that is freely available on the independent and government-funded website ‚ÄòMoneySmart‚Äô (the comparator/control). The primary objective is to test the feasibility of systematising the identification and referral pathway between the CFH and financial counselling services for families of young children at risk of or experiencing poverty and deprivation. This primary outcome is assessed with uptake data, and not a between-groups comparison of the RCT. The secondary objectives are to explore the short-term impacts of the intervention on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and use of financial services, and will be evaluated via a superiority trial design with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint at 6 months (noting the sample size is designed to test feasibility and underpowered to test efficacy), in conjunction with qualitative interviews.</p>
                <p>This feasibility RCT is a first step toward a definitive multisite effectiveness trial to examine whether the HWF intervention could reduce the impact of poverty and deprivation for Australian families when delivered at scale. While the pilot was not originally planned with the COVID-19 pandemic in mind, the catastrophic effects of the pandemic on family finances and well-being mean it is increasingly important to refine the feasibility and processes of this potential intervention.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>The purpose of financial counselling intervention is to help each family maximise their income, reduce debt and help with budgeting. Thus, the intervention is tailored to a participant‚Äôs personal and financial needs. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, financial counsellors typically worked with clients over the phone or at the counsellors‚Äô offices. In some instances of access issues, they visited a client in their home. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the participating financial counsellors predominately deliver their services via phone. For non-English-speaking clients, it is usual practice for the financial counsellors to deliver the service via a multilingual counsellor, or in conjunction with an independent telephone interpreter.</p>
                <p>Following allocation to the intervention, a referral with the participant‚Äôs contact information is emailed to the financial counsellor intake address, and a financial counsellor is assigned. The participant is contacted to arrange the first intervention appointment, which includes confirming contact and demographic details; ascertaining capacity to make financial decisions; discussing and prioritising financial needs; and planning for working together. Clients are asked to gather and send paperwork to financial counsellors or external agencies and are assisted by the financial counsellor to complete forms in a timely and accurate manner. Financial counsellors often contact and negotiate with creditors on a client‚Äôs behalf. Each participant has as many visits with the financial counsellor as they need; these are scheduled together and confirmed by phone calls and text messages.</p>
                <p>The comparator is usual care plus money advice that is freely available on the federally funded Australian Securities and Investments Commission‚Äôs <italic>MoneySmart</italic> website (the control). <italic>MoneySmart</italic> provides objective, plain-language advice developed by financial counsellors on a comprehensive range of debt, budgetary management and financial literacy topics, and selected resources are available in multiple languages. <italic>MoneySmart</italic> outlines methods and contact details for further financial, legal and crisis support; this includes the National Debt Helpline, a free hotline which links callers to a local financial counselling service. <italic>MoneySmart</italic> is commonly used by Australian financial counsellors to advise clients. While the comparator offers valuable but passive information via a website, it is distinct from the intervention, which operationalises this information for eligible families by tailoring support to their immediate financial needs and challenges.</p>

                <p>Potential participants are individuals who have an appointment with a participating CFH nurse and fulfil the eligibility criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). The nurse managers (study partners) select the nurses and centres who conduct screening. Participating nurses complete a short screening survey with clients at their appointments. <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">Box 1</xref> describes the screening items which were co-designed by the HWF collaborating partners.

                </fig>
                <p>If the screening survey shows that a client is eligible for the study, the nurse mentions this and asks if the client would like more information. If a client agrees, nurses note this, check and record the client‚Äôs contact information on the survey form, and explain that they will pass the client‚Äôs contact details onto the research team who will contact them. If a client says no, nurses record a reason where one is provided and return the screening data to the research team without recording the client‚Äôs identifying information. Surveys are collected until the necessary sample size for each site is reached or the recruitment period ends.</p>
                <p>Eligible clients are welcomed to the study by the research team via phone call or email within a week of the team receiving the screening survey. Over the phone, a researcher introduces the study and answers any questions that potential participants have about the study. Interpreters are engaged for phone calls and visits as indicated on the screening survey or identified during phone calls. The study welcome email includes the Participant Information and Consent Form (PICF) and enrolment questionnaire. Participants can provide informed consent by: (1) clicking the relevant consent link on the electronic version and following the database prompts; (2) signing the electronic version and returning to the study email or by post, (3) verbally on the phone or by video link, or when face-to-face visits are possible and safe, (4) signing the hardcopy in person with the researcher.</p>

The financial counsellors are informed who the intervention participants are but do not know who the control participants are, unless control participants seek the services of a financial counsellor themselves (as can happen in usual care), and disclose participation in the research study. The nurses are not informed of allocation but may become aware if participants disclose it, or the research team seeks a nurse‚Äôs advice to respond to a support issue involving the participant.</p>
