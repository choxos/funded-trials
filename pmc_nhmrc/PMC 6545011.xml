                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The risk of falling is significantly higher in people with chronic stroke and it is, therefore, important to design interventions to improve mobility and decrease falls risk. Minimum toe clearance (MTC) is the key gait cycle event for predicting tripping-falls because it occurs mid-swing during the walking cycle where forward velocity of the foot is maximum.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">High forward velocity coupled with low MTC increases the probability of unanticipated foot-ground contacts. Training procedures to increase toe-ground clearance (MTC) have potential, therefore, as a falls-prevention intervention. The aim of this project is to determine whether augmented sensory information via real-time visual biofeedback during gait training can increase MTC.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Participants will be aged &gt; 18 years, have sustained a single stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) at least six months previously, able to walk 50 m independently, and capable of informed consent. Using a secure web-based application (REDCap), 150 participants will be randomly assigned to either no-feedback (Control) or feedback (Experimental) groups; all will receive 10 sessions of treadmill training for up to 10 min at a self-selected speed over 5–6 weeks. The intervention group will receive real-time, visual biofeedback of MTC during training and will be asked to modify their gait pattern to match a required “target” criterion. Biofeedback is continuous for the first six sessions then progressively reduced (faded) across the remaining four sessions. Control participants will walk on the treadmill without biofeedback. Gait assessments are conducted at baseline, immediately following the final training session and then during follow-up, at one, three, and six months. The primary outcome measure is MTC. Monthly falls calendars will also be collected for 12 months from enrolment.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">The project will contribute to understanding how stroke-related changes to sensory and motor processes influence gait biomechanics and associated tripping risk. The research findings will guide our work in gait rehabilitation following stroke and may reduce falls rates. Treadmill training procedures incorporating continuous real-time feedback may need to be modified to accommodate stroke patients who have greater difficulties with treadmill walking.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Stroke affects &gt; 60,000 Australians every year, with 50% unable to walk one week following the event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Impaired walking impacts independence by reducing the ability to perform everyday activities and limiting community participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Falls risk is significantly higher in people with chronic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and approximately 50% of people living at home after a stroke will fall within 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], with up to half sustaining multiple falls. Furthermore, in community-dwelling people with stroke, up to 77% of falls occurred during walking. While there has been considerable research investigating falls risk management for older people generally, high-risk groups, such as those who have had a stroke, have not been extensively studied with respect to targeted falls prevention. Traditional exercise-based falls-prevention programs are useful for the general older adult community but are not effective in people with stroke. For example, Batchelor et al. found that a multifactorial intervention including a home-based balance and strength program did not reduce falls in people with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another study confirmed that a group- and home-based exercise program incorporating balance and strength training did not reduce falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This suggests that alternative, targeted treatments to reduce falls risk in people with stroke are urgently needed.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Stroke adversely affects sensorimotor function and muscle strength, inhibiting the capacity to activate appropriate muscles and increasing the risk of contact between the foot and either the supporting surface or objects on it. Said et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found, for example, that stroke participants who had difficulty in stepping over small obstacles (4 cm high) had greater falls rates. The key gait variable for predicting tripping-falls is minimum toe clearance (MTC), an event mid-swing in the walking cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Low MTC increases the probability of unanticipated foot-ground contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given that tripping directly results from unsuccessful toe clearance, previous research with both young and older populations has focused on toe trajectory control during walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Training individuals to increase MTC, therefore, has potential as a falls-prevention intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par15">The aim of this project is to determine whether real-time biofeedback of toe clearance during gait training can significantly minimize tripping risk in people with stroke. We will test the efficacy of real-time biofeedback as an intervention to increase MTC using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design incorporating both a training or “acquisition” phase with biofeedback. Retention tests will be conducted to confirm <italic>learning</italic>, as demonstrated by the longer-term or “relative permanence” of the targeted behavior.</p>
              <p id="Par16">The primary objective is to determine whether real-time biofeedback of MTC during gait training will significantly increase MTC in people with stroke. We will also determine whether changes in MTC achieved on a treadmill transfer to overground walking. It is hypothesized that, compared to no-biofeedback training, visual biofeedback of foot clearance parameters during gait training will significantly increase toe-ground clearance (MTC) and MTC during biofeedback training will be retained in the longer term. It is also hypothesized that increases in MTC demonstrated in treadmill training will transfer to overground walking, such that tripping-risk in people with stroke is significantly reduced.</p>

                <p id="Par22">All participants, both controls and those in the feedback intervention group, will walk on the treadmill following an identical schedule of training sessions. Self-selected walking speed will be determined following treadmill familiarization with a physiotherapist during the first clinical assessment visit. This self-selected walking speed will be recorded and each treadmill walking session will be conducted at the same walking speed. All participants wear a safety harness when treadmill walking and continue for up to 10 min with rest breaks as required. Previous research by the authors had determined 10 min to be comfortable maximum for this population. Participants will wear the same comfortable shoes for all walking activities.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Participants randomized to the intervention group undertake biofeedback gait-training using a real-time display of the affected limb’s swing phase trajectory, with toe clearance and the associated MTC event clearly shown. Motion analysis markers will be attached to the shoe and other body segments to calculate toe clearance parameters in real-time as per the established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. <italic>Target</italic> MTC will be calculated as baseline MTC plus 1 SD. The feedback group will be asked to move their affected limb such that MTC falls between target MTC mean + 0.5SD and target MTC-0.5SD, projected as parallel lines on a screen in front of the treadmill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. If baseline MTC cannot be calculated, target boundaries will be set using the <italic>maximum</italic> toe clearance (TC) with instructions to control foot motion within that target band. Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion will be recorded after each session.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Biofeedback is presented for the first six sessions then progressively reduced (faded) across the remaining four sessions. During fading, one-third of the initial feedback will be available at the beginning of session 7, one-third in the middle for session 8, one-third at the end of session 9, and, finally, one-10th at the beginning and one-10th at the end of session 10. As indicated above, the control group will walk under the same conditions without either feedback or any instructions concerning their gait control. Adherence to the gait training program will be reflected in the number of training sessions successfully completed and the research team will monitor any non-adherence.</p>

                  <p id="Par36">Gait assessment trials are conducted at baseline, after the final training session (a minimum of 20 min following final training) and one, three, and six months later. These gait data are collected during treadmill and overground walking by biomechanics personnel blinded to group allocation. During overground walking assessments (before and after training) participants walk at preferred speed along an 8-m walkway. Kinematic (position/time) data are captured using a three-dimensional motion analysis system (Optotrak®, NDI, Canada) with clusters of infrared markers fixed to the toe of the shoe and the shank, thigh, and pelvis segments. Bony landmarks on the foot, ankle, knee, and hip are identified using virtual markers and used with the clusters in order to construct a model of the joints and segments. This enables kinematic data, including joint angles, to be calculated. Foot plantar pressures and center of pressure excursion (COPE) are captured to assess gait stability using the Pedar foot pressure insole (Novel, Germany), an in-shoe system that measures plantar pressure distribution within the shoe.</p>

Retention MTC data at one, three, and six months for the affected limb will determine whether the target MTC, i.e. baseline MTC plus 1 SD, has been maintained after visual biofeedback training has concluded.

Baseline and retention clinical data will show how falls risk measures were influenced by feedback training. The association between the clinical tests and the biomechanical variables will be shown by correlating tripping probability and clinical measures. Medio-lateral and anterior-posterior foot pressure (COPE) shifts will reveal biofeedback effects on gait stability. A further secondary outcome is the number of falls following training. These data will be collected via monthly falls calendars for 12 months from enrolment in the study as illustrated in the SPIRIT study timeline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>SPIRIT study timeline.

                <p id="Par39">In determining sample sizes, for the between-group comparisons, to detect differences in MTC a medium effect size (ES = f = 0.25) between the group effects (No-Feedback versus Feedback) across the two time points (baseline and after training) a total of 126 or 63 per group is required (G*Power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] calculation, 2 × 2 repeated measures design, α = 0.05, power = 0.85, correlation = 0.7). To allow a 20% drop-out, we shall initially recruit 75 participants per group (<italic>N</italic> = 150). This sample size will also allow detection of an increase of 1 SD in MTC of the biofeedback group, compared to their pre-training. The probability of tripping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] calculated using the pilot (stroke) participants’ data suggests that a 1 SD (0.77 cm) increase in MTC will result in significant reduction in the risk of tripping on small (1–2 cm) obstacles. A 0.77-cm increase in MTC represents approximately a 50% gain in minimum ground clearance (mean MTC = 1.4 cm) that is shown by our modelling to represent a substantial decrease in tripping risk, i.e. the probability of contacting an obstruction of a given height.</p>

              <p id="Par45">This innovative study will evaluate the impact of augmented sensory information for improving gait function, specifically foot-ground clearance, via visually presented biofeedback. The research findings will contribute to the broader falls prevention initiative by demonstrating the effectiveness of toe clearance biofeedback in making walking safer. It will also confirm whether faded feedback enhances learning by demonstrating how performance is affected immediately following training and whether it can be retained in the long term. If shown to be effective, there will be opportunities for biofeedback-training applications to other gait-impaired clinical populations. The project’s findings will contribute to understanding how stroke-related changes to sensory and motor processes influence the tripping risks of everyday walking. The protocol is, however, limited to people with chronic stroke capable of walking on a treadmill due to the continuous real-time feedback used for gait training.</p>
