                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. There is a need for adjuvant, targeted therapies to improve outcomes. Broccoli sprout extract, rich in the antioxidant sulforaphane, reduces oxidative stress and placental secretion of the antiangiogenic factors that contribute to vascular dysfunction in preeclampsia. We propose a phase III trial investigating broccoli sprout extract. We will assess broccoli sprout extract in women with early onset (&lt;34 weeks) preeclampsia, investigating (1) the interval between enrolment and delivery (days), (2) biomarkers of placental and endothelial function and (3) maternal and fetal outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial will be conducted at Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia. One hundred and eighty women (45 each arm of each stratum) with early onset preeclampsia (defined as per Society for Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand guidelines) will be recruited. Consenting women will be randomised to receive an oral dose of either broccoli sprout extract (24 mg of activated sulforaphane) or identical placebo, twice daily until delivery. Maternal blood will be collected antenatally for measurement of biomarkers of preeclampsia, including soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble endoglin (sEng) and activin A, as well as circulating sulforaphane metabolites. Maternal and perinatal outcomes will be monitored throughout. All clinical care decisions, including the timing of delivery, will be made by the treating team, blinded to treatment allocation. Participation in this trial will not affect routine care. At delivery, maternal and cord blood and placentae will be collected to measure sulforaphane metabolites and sFlt-1, PlGF, sEng and activin A.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Preeclampsia is defined as new onset hypertension after 20 weeks’ gestation with associated maternal organ dysfunction and/or fetal growth restriction.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It complicates 5%–8% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Even in high-resource settings the risk of neonatal mortality is fivefold greater in those born to a mother with preeclampsia compared with those born to a normotensive mother. This increased mortality is largely due to associated fetal growth restriction and the need for premature delivery. Indeed, preeclampsia is the leading cause of iatrogenic premature delivery, implicated in 20% of all premature births.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Unfortunately, the incidence of preeclampsia has not changed over the last century and, beyond controlling maternal blood pressure, we continue to lack effective targeted therapies for this serious disorder.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref>
</p>
              <p>Though much remains unknown about the pathological progression of preeclampsia, it is broadly accepted that a placenta, chronically injured by ischaemic-reperfusion insult, releases excessive vasoactive and inflammatory factors into the maternal circulation. In turn, these factors induce systemic maternal endothelial dysfunction.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The resulting vasoconstriction and increased vessel permeability cause hypertension, oedema, renal endotheliosis and secondary organ ischaemic injury. For the last 50 years, the pharmacological management of preeclampsia has aimed solely to correct the maternal hypertension, allowing safer continuation of the pregnancy in the interests of improving fetal maturity. While the focus on controlling hypertension has improved maternal and perinatal outcomes it has neglected the underlying pathological processes of the disease and limited the potential gains in mitigating fetal risk, particularly in the setting of early onset disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Seeking to prolong the pregnancy further by targeting the oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction is an additional approach worth exploring.</p>
              <p>In particular, inducers of the nuclear factor E2-like related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway offer an attractive approach. Inducing Nrf2 would be expected to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in both the placenta and in the maternal vasculature. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 is an endogenous inducer of cellular antioxidants.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Under physiological conditions, bioavailable levels of Nrf2 are regulated by cytosolic binding to kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1), preventing rapid proteasome degradation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Exposure to oxidative stress induces cysteine modifications to KEAP-1, loss of binding to Nrf2 and translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Within the nucleus, by combining with small maf-proteins in the promoter region of antioxidant ‘safeguarding’ genes, Nrf2 stimulates antioxidant response elements resulting in the transcription of mRNA for a number of cellular antioxidants and phase II enzymes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Numerous studies have shown therapeutic benefits from Nrf2 stimulation both in maintaining endothelial health and in treating vasculopathies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>The Nrf2 inducer sulforaphane is a naturally occurring organosulphur abundant in broccoli sprout extract<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> that has attracted attention in cardiovascular and cancer medicine.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> It stabilises Nrf2 by impairing ubiquitination and increasing Nrf2 phosphorylation, thereby preventing proteasomal degradation and causing cytosolic accumulation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Sulforaphane also induces cytosolic transcription and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. As such, sulforaphane uses the Nrf2 pathways to enhance production of phase II and antioxidant enzymes, improving cellular resilience to oxidative stress.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 10</xref>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>Preeclampsia remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While the introduction of antihypertensives 60 years ago represented a major advance in the care of women with preeclampsia, further progress has all but stalled. Future benefits in maternal and/or perinatal outcomes are likely to come from improved screening and prevention<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or from more effective treatment, beyond simply managing maternal hypertension.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> In particular, therapies that target the maternal endothelial dysfunction that underlies the hypertension offer promise in further improving maternal and perinatal outcomes. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory sulforaphane may be one such therapy. Preliminary data from our group support a role for sulforaphane in reducing placental production of the antiangiogenic factors soluble fms-like tyrosine kinas 1 (sFlt-1) and activin A. We have further shown that sulforaphane improves endothelial cell health and function after activation with tumour necrosis factor alpha and serum from pre-eclamptic women. Whether sulforaphane has beneficial in vivo effects on placental and/or endothelial function in women with early onset preeclampsia remains unexplored. We aim to examine this possibility in our clinical trial, <italic>Prolong</italic>.</p>
                <sec id="s1-1-1">
                  <title>Aims and hypothesis</title>
                  <p>We hypothesise that administration of Broccomax will significantly increase duration of pregnancy, specifically the interval between diagnosis of preeclampsia and delivery.</p>
                  <p>The overarching aim of this trial is to assess the utility of a commercial broccoli sprout extract (BroccoMax) as an adjuvant therapy in the management of women with early onset (&lt;34 weeks) preeclampsia.</p>
                  <p><italic>Aim 1</italic>. To assess whether broccoli sprout extract can safely prolong the interval between enrolment and delivery (recorded in days) in women with early onset (&lt;34 weeks) preeclampsia.</p>

To allow for a 5% attrition rate, we elected a sample size of 45 in each arm, equating to a total of 90 participants. Randomisation for this study will be stratified within two gestation brackets: 24<sup>+0</sup>–30<sup>+0</sup>, 30<sup>+0</sup>–33<sup>+6</sup>. Because the power analysis was performed based on a study with a single stratum, we elected to have 90 participants in each stratum, requiring a total of 180 participants. This study is powered on the primary outcome of interval between enrolment and delivery, rather than secondary outcomes.</p>

Differences in the primary outcome, time from enrolment to delivery in days, and secondary outcomes (safety data) will be compared between the two treatment groups. Continuous variables will be compared with a t-test (normally distributed variables) or Mann-Whitney U (non-normally distributed data). Categorical data will be assessed using a χ<sup>2</sup>. If possibly, non-parametric data will be transformed to allow parametric comparisons. The interaction between gestation at diagnosis and treatment group will also be assessed and regression approaches (using either an interaction term or gestation as a covariate) will be used to assess the relationship between treatment arm and time to delivery after assessing assumptions. Survival analysis will also be performed (after assessing assumptions) to account for censoring and survival/failure will be graphed with Kaplan-Meier curves. Linear mixed models regression will be used to compare differences in maternal angiogenic markers, TSH and T3/T4 over time between the two treatment groups. If there is a non-constant interaction between time and the outcome of interest, we will include this parameter in the model and investigate biochemical samples at specific pregnancy time points.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Prolong is a pragmatic superiority trial designed to increase the interval between enrolment and delivery for women with preeclampsia. Here, we propose the use of a novel antioxidant to target the oxidative stress underlying preeclampsia. Through this trial, we aim to add to the collective knowledge about novel therapeutics for preeclampsia and, if successful, ultimately establish a new medical intervention that improves outcomes for women with preeclampsia and their babies.</p>
              <p>If effective, we believe that adjuvant use of a broccoli sprout extract, or a similar sulforaphane source, will significantly reduce the serious disease burden attributed to preeclampsia. Cheaply and simply reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with disease for both mother and child will have application in both high-resource and low-resource settings. However, sample size limitations are inevitable in a phase III trial and we acknowledge that there is a risk of under power and type II error. Therefore, this study was designed to power for only our primary outcome. Future investigation with larger populations and further assessment of short-term and long-term infant outcomes will be necessary. Similarly, the single centre nature of this trial and subsequent issues in population bias are a limitation of this study that will be addressed in future investigations. Larger trials of the efficacy and clinical application of broccoli sprout extract will be necessary if prolong produces positive results. We hope that this initial trial will provide sufficient evidence to support and inform future such trials.</p>
