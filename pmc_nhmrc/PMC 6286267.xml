                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to assess chemosensitivity to anti-cancer agents in real-time may improve cancer care by enabling individualized clinical decision-making. However, it is unknown whether this new approach will be met with acceptance by patients, family and community.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We used a cross-sectional structured survey to investigate PDX acceptability with 1550 individuals across Australia and New Zealand (648 survivors of adult and childhood cancer, versus 650 community comparisons; and 48 parents of childhood cancer survivors versus 204 community parents). We identified factors influencing willingness-to-use PDXs, willingness-to-pay, maximum acceptable wait-time, and maximum acceptable number of mice used per patient.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>PDXs were highly acceptable: &gt;80% of those affected by cancer felt the potential advantages of PDXs outweighed the disadvantages (community participants: 68%). Survivors' and survivors' parents' most highly endorsed advantage was ‘increased chance of survival’. ‘Harm to animals’ was the least endorsed disadvantage for all groups. Cancer survivors were more willing to use PDXs than community comparisons [p &lt; ·001]. Survivors and survivors' parents were willing to pay more [p &lt; ·001; p = ∙004 respectively], wait longer for results [p = ·03; p = ∙01], and use more mice [p = ·01; p &lt; ∙001] than community comparisons. Male survivors found PDXs more acceptable [p = ·01] and were willing to pay more [p &lt; ·001] than female survivors. Survivors with higher incomes found PDXs more acceptable [p = ·002] and were willing to pay more [p &lt; ·001] than survivors with lower incomes. Mothers found PDXs more acceptable [p = ·04] but were less willing to wait [p = ·02] than fathers.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>We found significant attitudinal support for PDX-guided cancer care. Willingness-to-pay and maximum acceptable number of mice align well with likely future usage. Maximum acceptable wait-times were lower than is currently achievable, highlighting an important area for future patient education until technology has caught up.</p>

                  <p id="p0010">Using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to guide treatment decision-making within personalized medicine programs may represent a significant advance in cancer care. However, patient and community preferences can shape the success of newly developed technologies. PDX models are nearing implementation into personalized medicine programs worldwide, warranting this timely evaluation of their acceptability and likely future uptake in personalized cancer care.</p>

                  <title>Added value of this study</title>
                  <p id="p0015">This is the first study to evaluate the acceptability of PDXs to guide treatment decision-making in cancer care. This study of 1,550 individuals affected by cancer and community comparisons comprehensively assesses: perceived advantages/disadvantages of PDXs, willingness to use PDXs if diagnosed with cancer, maximum acceptable out-of-pocket costs/patient, maximum acceptable time to receive PDX results and treatment recommendations, and maximum acceptable number of mice used per patient. Our study compares the perspectives of cancer survivors with community comparisons (who may face a future cancer diagnosis), strengthening the study's generalizability. It also investigates the perspectives of parents considering PDXs for their child.</p>

                  <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
                  <p id="p0020">Our results show high willingness-to-use PDXs, indicating a likely high uptake of PDXs in future practice, particularly for children with cancer. Participants' willingness-to-pay and maximum acceptable number of mice align well with planned PDX models. However, current wait times appear too long for participants, who preferred potentially unachievable maximum wait times in current models. This emphasizes the need to educate potential patients appropriately upon enrolment into PDX-guided personalized medicine programs to manage their expectations. Our results will inform the successful implementation of PDX models, and similar technologies, and guide the future of patient involvement in cancer treatment decision-making.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0025">Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) can be created by engrafting an individual patient's tumor into immune-deficient mice [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Once the tumor has engrafted, the tumor is extracted and implanted into secondary recipient mice, creating further cohorts of mice with tumors which closely mirror the patient's original tumor. These PDXs (or ‘mouse avatars’) can then be used for drug efficacy studies by randomly assigning groups of mice to receive different therapies [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therapies demonstrating efficacy in the mice can then be prioritized as potential targeted therapies for the patient [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In some instances, drug efficacy studies can be carried out using mice directly engrafted with the original patient biopsy material, without the necessity for engraftment into secondary recipient mice [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0030">PDXs represent a new advance in the use of murine models for personalized cancer care [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Until now, mice carrying human cancer tissue have largely been used pre-clinically to understand oncogenesis, develop new therapies, and evaluate drug sensitivity for future patients [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While traditional models remain invaluable, they cannot address inter-patient variability in drug response [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PDXs used in ‘real-time’ personalized medicine platforms may better predict the likely effectiveness of an anticancer therapy for an individual patient, potentially identifying therapies that might not normally be used in the conventional treatment of a particular cancer type.</p>
              <p id="p0035">Early data on the drug response concordance between the original and the engrafted tumor are promising [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], suggesting that adding a personalized in-vivo approach may increase the predictive value of in-vitro testing in personalized medicine trials [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. PDXs have been trialled in childhood [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and adult [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] cancer. PDXs may offer a means of selecting the best therapy for cancer patients in personalized medicine programs worldwide, potentially increasing survival rates [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], avoiding toxic and costly side-effects of ineffective therapies [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and, ideally, yielding a faster recovery [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additional benefits may include new discoveries that benefit future patients<sup>11</sup> and, if nothing else, reassurance that the healthcare team ‘tried everything’.</p>
              <p id="p0040">Despite their exciting potential, PDXs have limitations. Engraftment success rates vary widely, affected by tumor type and transplantation site [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While engrafted tumors are often faithful to the original tumor (up to approximately 80% of cases) [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], they may not perfectly mirror it [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The kinetics of engraftment also vary, with some engraftments taking months [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], creating substantial delays before recommendations can be made. For some, recommendations will not be possible because of technical challenges, including lack of engraftment of the original patient's tumor [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0045">Patients will usually receive standard care while they await their PDX-derived treatment recommendations. Some will need to decide whether to change treatment after receiving recommendations. Others will receive the recommendation too late to be of clinical use [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PDXs also use varying numbers of mice per patient (often determined by multiple factors, including the patient's tumor type, the number of possibly useful anti-cancer therapies identified for the patient, the amount of tissue available, and the availability of laboratory resources). PDXs are also expensive, raising questions about ‘who’ should pay and the acceptable cost [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0050">PDX-guided personalized medicine has the potential to revolutionize future cancer treatment [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Yet, neither individuals affected by cancer, nor the general community, have been consulted regarding PDXs. Given that successful implementation of new technologies into clinical care relies on patients' acceptance and possibly on their willingness-to-pay [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it is important to assess acceptability before new technologies are widely adopted. PDXs are on the cusp of implementation into personalized medicine programs worldwide, with the US BEAUTY study [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the Canadian Cancer Avatar Study [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the Australian Zero Childhood Cancer program [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0055">We collected data from individuals who have been affected by cancer (including, survivors of adult cancer, survivors of childhood cancer, and parents of childhood cancer survivors) and those who have not been affected by cancer (community comparisons).

We recruited survivors of adult cancers and community comparisons through three voluntary online research panels (Register4 and PathFinder for adult cancer survivors, PureProfile for community comparisons). The panels have national coverage and reach a demographically diverse participant group.

[<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we created a decisional balance score for each participant by calculating the individual's mean advantages ratings divided by their mean disadvantages ratings. Values above one indicated a leaning towards the advantages, suggesting that PDXs were considered “acceptable”. Values below one indicated a leaning towards the disadvantages, and that PDXs were “not acceptable”. A value of one represented decisional equivalence, that is, neither the advantages nor the disadvantages outweighed the other. For this study we categorized a decisional balance score of one as “not acceptable”.</p>
                <p id="p0180">We excluded a random selection of 135 community adults under the age of 43, and a further 95 male community adults under the age of 43 to match the cancer and community groups. We used independent and paired samples <italic>t</italic>-tests and a 2 × 2 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine between and within group differences in the cancer and community groups. We computed exploratory regressions to explore sociodemographic factors (sex, income, education and rurality) influencing four outcomes: decisional balance, willingness-to-pay, maximum acceptable wait-time, and maximum acceptable number of mice. We produced bivariate correlations between outcome variables and influencing factors first, and then included correlations with p ≤ ·02 in the final regression models. We performed bootstrapping on all final regression models. Given the differences in timing and type of treatment patients typically receive across cancer diagnoses (e.g., chemotherapy for hematological cancers, surgery for solid tumors), we also conducted a secondary analysis investigating differences between hematological and solid cancers for the four main outcome variables. Significant differences were determined using Welch's <italic>t</italic>-test, given the large difference in sample size across these two diagnosis groups [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

              <p id="p0190">The groups were well matched: there were no significant sex, age, income, or rurality differences between survivors and community comparisons. A higher percentage of survivors had post-school qualifications compared with community participants, so we included education in all regression models. There were no significant sociodemographic differences between survivors' parents and community parents. One adult survivor, eight community adults, and one community parent indicated that they did not understand PDXs.

              <p id="p0290">Most cancer survivors, parents of childhood cancer survivors, and the general community favor the use of PDXs in future cancer therapeutic strategies. Participants reported a high willingness-to-use and a perception that PDX advantages outweighed disadvantages, suggesting likely high consent rates when PDXs are implemented into personalized cancer care. Reflecting the salience of the cancer experience, those affected by cancer were more willing to use PDXs and were willing to pay more, wait longer, and use more mice, than community participants. Reflecting the notion that the ‘stakes are higher’ when considering cancer in a child, parents reported being willing to pay large sums and use many mice, for their child. Other sociodemographic factors appeared important too. Males found PDXs more acceptable, and were willing to pay more than females, while mothers found PDXs more acceptable but were willing to wait less time, than fathers. Participants with higher incomes found PDXs more acceptable and were willing to pay more. Willingness-to-pay and maximum acceptable number of mice appeared largely in line with the likely PDX services of the future [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], although many participants' maximum acceptable wait-times were lower than is currently achievable [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0295">PDX efficacy data, while promising, is not yet robust [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our description of PDXs did not state that PDXs were effective, yet many participants endorsed ‘potential improved survival’ as their most important perceived advantage (particularly survivors and survivors' parents). Potential health benefit is a key motivator for many patients and parents considering enrolling in research [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While willingness-to-use did decline somewhat after consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of PDXs, willingness-to-use remained high, especially in those affected by cancer. It seems that disclosure of PDX limitations will be unlikely to dissuade families. Ensuring fully informed consent will be challenging, given the complexity of the PDX process [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], differences in PDX models across institutions [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the often overwhelming availability of cancer information [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and low pre-existing health literacy in some patients [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. PDX information should follow patient education guidelines [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to ensure that materials are easy-to-understand, while consent consultations should carefully gauge patient/parent understanding, and encourage question-asking.</p>
              <p id="p0300">Cancer is a life threatening diagnosis: it is therefore understandable that patients and parents feel impatient to receive treatment recommendations. Yet, wait-times for PDX results/recommendations are currently longer than most other tests in cancer care. Given our data showing a disconnect between participants' maximum acceptable wait-times, and current engraftment efficiency [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it is important that consent consultations/forms clearly highlight the likely wait-time for PDX results. Our data (reflecting other willingness-to-wait studies) [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] indicate the steepest drop in willingness-to-wait when the wait-time increases from one to three months, suggesting that patients/parents may need additional support once the wait-time exceeds one-month. Our data suggesting possible sex differences in willingness-to-wait (males and fathers appeared willing to wait longer than females and mothers) also warrant further investigation. There are few health-focussed studies available comparing willingness-to-wait between males and females. One study reported equivalent willingness-to-wait in males and females waiting for care in an emergency department [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. More generally, our findings may have been influenced by sex differences in general healthcare-seeking behaviors, with research suggesting that men might be less likely to engage in health care-seeking behaviors, including waiting longer to seek medical advice about their symptoms [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0305">Many participants (particularly parents, those with higher incomes and those with hematological cancers) were willing to pay large out-of-pocket costs for PDXs. This willingness-to-pay likely reflects a perception of high worth of PDXs, as well as serving as a surrogate indicator of likelihood of adoption [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Fear of cancer recurrence, which remains prevalent even decades after treatment completion [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], may have driven survivors' and survivors' parents' willingness-to-use and pay. This powerful fear likely represents a vulnerability for families desperate for a cure [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that commercial laboratories are already offering costly direct-to-consumer PDX services [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], this raises concerns about how PDXs will be marketed to vulnerable families, and highlights the need for careful PDX regulation [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0310">The role of animals in society appears to be transforming. Animal advocacy groups often fight for a reduction in the use of research animals, yet PDXs will involve dozens of mice per patient. Despite these numbers, and the fact that PDXs form a more direct link between animals and individual patients, our finding that ‘harm to animals’ was the least endorsed disadvantage reflects an acceptance of the use of animals for potentially lifesaving purposes. Like other studies [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we showed that acceptability dropped with the use of more animals. However, individuals affected by cancer clearly accepted the largest numbers of mice (especially survivors' parents, most of whom indicated a willingness to use up to 1000 mice per child). This research question revealed the strongest discrepancy in views between individuals affected by cancer and community participants, which might create some discordance in future PDX implementation and funding models. It remains unclear how PDX acceptability might be shaped if increasing the number of mice used would also increase PDX efficacy.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="p0315">We recruited a large sample across two countries, plus a well-matched comparison group. However, anticipated uptake of new technologies does not always mirror actual uptake [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Participants' attitudes might change to reflect a higher acceptability if individuals are currently faced with cancer. It was not possible to calculate study response rates given the different recruitment methods used for each group. Our data may not generalize to other contexts, (e.g. non-English speaking communities, non-universal healthcare systems). Breast cancer survivors and women were over-represented, which is common [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recruiting survivors introduced a survival bias, creating an underrepresentation of aggressive cancers (e.g. lung cancer). A small amount of variance in our regressions was captured by our predictors, suggesting there are likely to be unmeasured variables influencing acceptability. Our different data collection methods (questionnaire versus interview) were necessary to ensure the representation of different cohorts. However, the data may have been influenced by the different data collection approaches.</p>

                <title>Future directions</title>
                <p id="p0320">Prospective studies assessing the impact of using PDXs to guide treatment decisions in personalized medicine programs are needed. There are several technical developments in PDXs which warrant additional acceptability studies, including the use of zebrafish and tumor organoids [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Patient/parent willingness to undergo additional procedures to enable PDX creation (e.g. biopsies) also remains unexplored, as does the acceptability of the term ‘avatar’ to describe PDXs. Healthcare systems need to consider the cost-benefits of PDXs as they move into clinical care [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PDXs will likely improve with time, potentially warranting ongoing research of the acceptability of the more sophisticated technology.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="p0325">PDXs are likely to play a key role in translational cancer care of the future, yielding personalized treatment information to guide clinical decision-making [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite being expensive and using animals to guide treatment decision-making [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], individuals affected by cancer, and the general community, find PDXs highly acceptable.</p>
