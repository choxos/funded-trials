                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There is currently little evidence of planning for real-world implementation of physical activity interventions. We are undertaking the ComeBACK (Coaching and Exercise for Better Walking) study, a 3-arm hybrid Type 1 randomised controlled trial evaluating a health coaching intervention and a text messaging intervention. We used an implementation planning framework, the PRACTical planning for Implementation and Scale-up (PRACTIS), to guide the process evaluation for the trial. The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol for the process evaluation of the ComeBACK trial using the framework of the PRACTIS guide.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A mixed methods process evaluation protocol was developed informed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on process evaluations for complex interventions and the PRACTIS guide. Quantitative data, including participant questionnaires, health coach and administrative logbooks, and website and text message usage data, is being collected over the trial period. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with trial participants, health coaches and health service stakeholders will explore expectations, factors influencing the delivery of the ComeBACK interventions and potential scalability within existing health services. These data will be mapped against the steps of the PRACTIS guide, with reporting at the level of the individual, provider, organisational and community/systems. Quantitative and qualitative data will elicit potential contextual barriers and facilitators to implementation and scale-up. Quantitative data will be reported descriptively, and qualitative data analysed thematically.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This process evaluation integrates an evaluation of prospective implementation and scale-up. It is envisaged this will inform barriers and enablers to future delivery, implementation and scale-up of physical activity interventions. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe the application of PRACTIS to guide the process evaluation of physical activity interventions.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par19">The benefits of physical activity participation have been extensively reported, with a comprehensive evidence synthesis supporting the newly updated World Health Organization physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite compelling evidence of the benefits of physical activity and its role in building ‘reserve capacity’ to prevent the decline in physical functioning and independence, participation rates remain low in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and are even lower for people with a physical disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Access to physical activity opportunities can be challenging for people with a disability and is influenced by multiple factors across domains including intrapersonal (e.g. attitudes, beliefs, body functions and structure), interpersonal (e.g. social supports, social processes), institutional (e.g. disability-specific knowledge and processes), community (e.g. education, equipment availability) and policy (e.g. funding, transportation systems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As such, interventions targeting improvements in physical activity need to be multifaceted, delivered by experienced health professionals, such as physiotherapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and enable tailoring to address and respond to dynamic factors. This can present challenges for evaluation, as traditional methods are more suited to simpler, static, individual-level study designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">When designing and testing interventions, there is an increasing awareness of the need to consider influences on and strategies for translating, disseminating, implementing and scaling up interventions from the beginning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, there is little evidence of this in most published physical activity research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent updated bibliometric review of physical activity research confirms that descriptive physical activity studies continue to dominate the literature, with research relevant for scale-up declining from 28% in 2008/2009 to 17% in 2017/2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This supports a previously published literature review where only 3% of papers reviewed reported on outcomes of scaled-up physical activity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Trials of effectiveness are not necessarily designed to capture data on implementation or produce outcomes that are readily transferable to practice. Newer trial designs, such as hybrid designs that consider effectiveness and implementation simultaneously, do so in order to expedite the translation of evidence into practice and policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as well as mediate some of the barriers to translating, disseminating, implementing and scaling up interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Hybrid type 1 studies have a primary focus on effectiveness outcomes whilst using a process evaluation to collect information regarding the implementation experience, adaptations and ongoing supports required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The UK Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for process evaluations of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] recommends examining implementation (dose, fidelity, adaptions), mechanisms of impact (e.g. participant and stakeholder responses, mediators) and contextual factors to understand the processes through which the intervention affects outcomes. Although this approach will help to inform implementation, it does not necessarily prospectively and systematically consider wider influences on implementation and scalability.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Consequently, we have used the PRACTical planning for Implementation and Scale-up (PRACTIS) guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which provides step-by-step guidance to prospectively and systematically consider factors which may influence intervention implementation and scale-up. The PRACTIS guide recommends an iterative four-step process to identify and plan for barriers and facilitators which can impact effective implementation and scale-up of population interventions. The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol for the process evaluation for the Coaching and Exercise for Better Walking (ComeBACK) randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] using the framework of the PRACTIS guide. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe the application of PRACTIS to guide the process evaluation of physical activity interventions.</p>

                <title>The ComeBACK trial</title>
                <p id="Par23">The ComeBACK trial is an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council-funded three-arm pragmatic hybrid type 1 randomised controlled trial of community-dwelling adults (<italic>n</italic> = 600) with self-reported difficulty walking. A detailed trial protocol has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and is briefly described below.</p>
                <sec id="Sec4">
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p id="Par24">ComeBACK participants are community-dwelling adults with a self-reported difficulty or inability to walk 800 m due to any cause, such as arthritis, neurological impairment or deconditioning. Individuals are ineligible to participate if they report any of the following: are wheelchair dependent; have major cognitive impairment, rapidly progressive neurological disease and insufficient hearing and/or English language skills; are living in residential aged care facilities or those currently meeting the Australian physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines for adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Participants must also have access to a mobile phone (to receive text messages) and Internet access (to use the ComeBACK website). Recruitment is underway in four states in Australia with participants randomised to one of three groups: (i) <italic>Coaching to ComeBACK</italic>, (ii) <italic>Texting to ComeBACK</italic> and (iii) <italic>Texting to ComeBACK Later</italic>.</p>

                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p id="Par25">The ComeBACK interventions vary in intensity and are based on the best current available evidence and theories of behaviour change including the COM-B model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Self-Determination Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Social Cognitive Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Self-Regulation Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] as described in the trial logic model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

                  <p id="Par26">The components of each intervention are described in detail in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Briefly, they consist of the following: (i) <italic>Coaching to ComeBACK</italic>: a physiotherapy assessment of physical capacity; handover between participant, health coach and physiotherapist; and fortnightly tailored telephone health coaching sessions by a physiotherapist. Participants can also access technologies such as pedometers, activity monitors or physical activity smartphone apps if desired; (ii) <italic>Texting to ComeBACK:</italic> a single telephone call by a physiotherapist health coach and text messages with some personalisation and tailoring at a frequency of 5 times per week initially with an option to alter the frequency of text messages after 1 month. The wait list control group, <italic>Texting to ComeBACK Later</italic>, receive the <italic>Texting to ComeBACK</italic> intervention after a 6-month delay.

Recruitment is monitored using a logbook to capture costs and insights about methods for engaging this population in the future.</p>

                    <p id="Par32">The health coaches delivering ComeBACK interventions are registered physiotherapists with experience in the management of people with walking difficulties and in delivering telephone health coaching in other research trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. They received training in behaviour change techniques (including motivational interviewing) and intervention delivery processes to standardise the intervention delivery. Coaches delivering the intervention are current employees of the institute where the research is being conducted and receive mentoring from study investigators and an external provider with extensive health coaching experience. These details are recorded as administration data in a logbook and will be reported descriptively along with staffing costs to provide details on implementation staff requirements for future implementation.</p>

                    <p id="Par33">Most of the ComeBACK interventions can be delivered remotely from a centralised location with resources such as a computer, telephone and Internet access. The face-to-face element of the interventions, i.e. the assessment of physical capacity and mobility within the <italic>Coaching to ComeBACK</italic> group, has been modified to video conferencing/phone calls, where necessary, as a result of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of this modification will be discussed with health coaches and participants in semi-structured interviews described below. Where a physiotherapist has conducted a face-to-face assessment, details such as where they were sourced and costs involved are recorded.</p>
                    <p id="Par34">Discrete parts of the ComeBACK interventions, such as the Web-based Short Messaging Service (SMS) delivery service and website development, have been contracted to organisations with existing relationships with health services to facilitate future embedding of the interventions into existing infrastructure. Additional resources, such as paper-based educational material and physical activity monitors, are also required for intervention delivery. All resources and services required to set up and deliver the ComeBACK intervention will be logged on an MS Excel spreadsheet to identify and value costs.</p>

                  <p id="Par35">Early engagement of key stakeholders is likely to lead to better partnerships, involvement and long-term sustainability of the programme. Key stakeholders include (i) those that fund or have ownership of the interventions, (ii) those responsible for the dissemination of the interventions to the target setting and population, (iii) those delivering the interventions and (iv) the target population receiving the interventions. For the ComeBACK trial, these stakeholders were engaged during intervention development. Previous qualitative work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] conducted with end users regarding their experiences of health coaching and technology use in rehabilitation has informed ComeBACK intervention development. Health service managers and government policymakers were engaged, at various stages, in the intervention design and are investigators in the trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par36">Identifying the potential barriers and facilitators to implementation and scale-up at an early stage may enhance the integration of research findings into real-world settings.

                  <p id="Par37">A detailed plan for monitoring and collection of qualitative and quantitative data (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) was developed to capture the potential barriers and facilitators to implementation and scale-up of the ComeBACK interventions across the various levels of the delivery system (i.e. individual, provider, organisational and community/system). This is described in more detail below. All qualitative work will be conducted by a postgraduate researcher (SW) under the guidance of experienced qualitative researchers (AT, AH).

We also plan to invite staff working at existing telephone health coaching services (e.g. <italic>Get Healthy NSW</italic>) to explore the model of service delivery and how the ComeBACK interventions may integrate with them. The semi-structured interviews may be face-to-face or via video conference/telephone, depending on the availability and preference of the interviewee, and would likely take between 30 and 40 min. The interview guide will be available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>
                  <p id="Par50">It is recognised that adaptation, a process of deliberate alteration to the design or delivery of an intervention, is a key concept in implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Adaptations may be proactive or reactive, considering the intent or goal of the modification, as well as contextual factors which may influence the decision. As such, all adaptations and modifications to the ComeBACK interventions and intended delivery will be recorded by study staff using the Framework for Modification and Adaptations—Expanded (FRAME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par51">Data, such as Working Alliance Inventory—Short Revised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], PACES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the attitudes to and experiences of physical activity survey, will be collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] hosted at The University of Sydney. All other quantitative data, such as recruitment and intervention logs, and physiotherapy assessment forms will be manually recorded in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets by study staff.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Data from the various Web-based platforms used during the ComeBACK trial (such as the Web-based text message service and the ComeBACK websites) will be extracted and/or analysed by the corresponding online tool. For example, Google analytics will be used to analyse the website usage of all groups and text message data will be extracted from the Web-based server into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par53">For qualitative data, audio-recordings of interviews and focus groups will be transcribed verbatim and imported into NVivo (version 12, QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) to assist in the process of data analysis. Initially, a subset of transcripts will be independently coded by two researchers using inductive (data driven) and deductive (driven by the PRACTIS framework and the theories underpinning the ComeBACK interventions as outlined in the logic model) approaches to develop initial codes prior to discussion. Codes will then be discussed, and a coding scheme refined and amended prior to the lead author (SW) continuing to code the remaining transcripts. Codes may continue to evolve in response to the data. Thematic analysis will be used to examine the categories of coded data and report on patterns within the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Divergent views will be recorded in any publications.</p>
                <p id="Par54">In order to more clearly understand the mechanisms relating to the delivery of the ComeBACK interventions, triangulation of the quantitative and qualitative data will occur in order to examine the data from different perspectives. For example, when assessing the fidelity of the <italic>Coaching to ComeBACK</italic> and <italic>Texting to ComeBACK</italic> interventions, data from the logs reporting the number of sessions, duration and content of each session will be analysed in conjunction with interview responses from the health coaches regarding the delivery of the intervention. More aligned responses may help to validate findings about delivery fidelity, whilst variation between the different data sources may prompt further investigation as to the underlying reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>

              <p id="Par56">In this paper, we describe a process evaluation specifically designed to incorporate assessment of implementation and scalability as well as prospective evaluation of two physical activity interventions for adults living in the community with a self-reported walking difficulty. We do this using the structure and framework of the PRACTIS guide, a four-step process which considers the means and suitability of the intervention to real-world implementation at scale. The information gathered from this evaluation will contribute to step 4 of the PRACTIS guide, addressing the barriers to implementation and scale-up.</p>
              <p id="Par57">This process evaluation has a number of strengths. Framed by the PRACTIS guide, it has a structured, comprehensive approach to data collection (qualitative and quantitative) and engagement with key stakeholders across all levels of the system. We believe this provides the first worked example of how this framework may be useful to structure future process evaluations within physical activity trials, in addition to the more formative development of intervention components. The use of mixed methods and multiple data sources will add depth and richness to the findings, allowing for an in-depth qualitative understanding of intervention delivery and implementation processes, backed with quantitative data. The process evaluation will not only report on the implementation of the two ComeBACK interventions, but also assess the various methods used for trial recruitment, providing valuable information on future dissemination specifically targeting this population.</p>
              <p id="Par58">There are also limitations to this process evaluation, one being the risk of reporting bias with a large amount of the data self-reported by health coaches. However, it is envisaged that this will be minimised through triangulation of data from multiple sources. It is unclear at this stage the depth to which we can explore the barriers and facilitators to these types of physical activity interventions with all relevant stakeholders, such as at the level of government policymakers. There is also a broader question not addressed in this evaluation, but which would be relevant to future implementation, which is why people decline to take part in these types of interventions. However, this population can be challenging to engage and (for pragmatic reasons) it is not part of this evaluation.</p>
              <p id="Par59">This process evaluation aims to assist in interpreting the findings of the ComeBACK trial, as well as adding rich information about how the ComeBACK interventions may be successfully implemented. Specifically, it will provide insights into potential barriers and facilitators to intervention delivery, implementation and scale-up of interventions to increase physical activity. It also provides a worked example of how to plan and conduct a process evaluation with a focus on implementation and scale-up.</p>
