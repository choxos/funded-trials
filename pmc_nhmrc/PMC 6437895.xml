                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There is well-established evidence that Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training improves knowledge about how to support someone developing a mental health problem, but less evidence that this support improves the mental health of the recipient of aid. This randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the long-term effects of MHFA training of parents on the mental health of their adolescent children.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">384 Australian parents of an adolescent aged 12â15 were randomised to receive either the 14-h Youth MHFA course or the 15-h Australian Red Cross Provide First Aid course. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up in both parents and adolescents. Primary outcomes were cases of adolescent mental health problems, and parental support towards their adolescent if they developed a mental health problem, rated by the parent and adolescent. Secondary outcomes included parent knowledge about mental health problems, intentions and confidence in supporting a young person, stigmatizing attitudes, and help-seeking for mental health problems.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Parent and adolescent reports showed no significant difference between training groups in the proportion of cases of adolescents with a mental health problem over time (psâ&gt;â.05). There was also no significant difference between training groups in the quality of parental support provided to their adolescent at 1- or 2-year follow-up (psâ&gt;â.05). In contrast, some secondary outcomes showed benefits from the Youth MHFA training relative to the control, with increased parental knowledge about mental health problems at 1-year (dâ=â0.43) and 2-year follow-up (dâ=â0.26), and increased confidence to help a young person (dâ=â0.26) and intentions to provide effective support (dâ=â0.22) at 1-year follow-up.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The study showed some improvements in mental health literacy in training recipients, but could not detect changes in the mental health of adolescents and the support provided to them by their parents if they had a mental health problem. However, there was a lack of power to detect primary outcome effects and therefore the question of whether MHFA training leads to better outcomes in the recipients of aid remains to be further explored.</p>

              <p id="Par12">Mental disorders often have their first onset during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, many young people with mental disorders do not receive professional help, or there is a substantial delay in seeking help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Barriers to help-seeking include a lack of knowledge about mental disorders and which professional help-seeking options are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], embarrassment or concern about what others might think, and a preference to seek help from family rather than professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As such, parents are ideally placed and motivated to recognise when their child may be developing a mental health problem, respond in a supportive manner and facilitate early professional help-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In order to provide this support, parents themselves need the relevant knowledge and skills. However, surveys of the Australian public show that many adults also have limited mental health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">An intervention which has the potential to improve the support that parents provide to adolescents developing a mental disorder is Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training. MHFA training is a course for members of the public in how to assist someone who is developing a mental illness or experiencing a mental health crisis situation (e.g. the person is suicidal or has had a traumatic experience). This first aid is given until the person receives appropriate professional help or until the crisis resolves. The course teaches adults how to give mental health first aid using a five-component MHFA Action Plan: Approach the person, assess and assist with any crisis; Listen non-judgmentally; Give support and information; Encourage the person to get appropriate professional help; and Encourage other supports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. MHFA training began in Australia in 2000 and has expanded rapidly. MHFA Australia supports over 1500 accredited instructors who have trained over 700,000 adults. Furthermore, the program has spread to 25 other countries. As well as the Standard MHFA course for adults, there is a tailored course for adults assisting adolescents (Youth MHFA), which contains additional teaching about eating disorders, non-suicidal self-injury, adolescent development and effective communication with an adolescent.</p>
              <p id="Par14">There has been extensive research on the effects of MHFA training. A recent meta-analysis of 18 controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] found benefits up to 6âmonths after training, with improved mental health first aid knowledge (dâ=â0.54), recognition of mental disorders (dâ=â0.52), beliefs about effective treatments (dâ=â0.19), and stigmatizing attitudes (dâ=â0.14). Improvements were also observed in confidence to help a person with a mental health problem (dâ=â0.46), intentions to provide first aid (dâ=â0.55), and the amount of help provided to a person with a mental health problem (dâ=â0.23). However, few studies examined the quality of help that was offered and the impact on the recipientâs mental health. Hence, there is well-established evidence that MHFA training improves mental health literacy and how to support someone developing a mental health problem, but less evidence that this support improves the mental health of the recipient of the aid. In most studies, the recipients cannot be contacted and benefits must be inferred from reports of the first aiders. Only two controlled trials have examined the mental health of aid recipients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], showing a small non-significant improvement up to 6âmonths after training (dâ=â0.14, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.33). The meta-analysis also found that the vast majority of evaluations have been on the standard adult course, with few controlled trials evaluating the Youth MHFA course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, there was limited research on whether training benefits lasted longer than 6âmonths.</p>
              <p id="Par15">The present study aimed to evaluate the 14-h Youth MHFA training course with parents of young adolescents to examine (a) whether the training helps parents to provide better support if their adolescent develops a mental health problem, and (b) whether this support benefits the adolescentâs mental health. The effects of the training were examined up to 2âyears later, allowing the long-term impact of MHFA training to be assessed for the first time.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par16">The study was a single-blind, parallel group superiority RCT with participants randomised to Youth MHFA (YMHFA) or Red Cross Provide First Aid (PFA) training in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612000390886). Provide First Aid training was chosen as the control condition as it teaches parents useful skills but was not expected to have any mental health benefit. Furthermore, it controls for non-specific training effects and allows for the long-term impact of the intervention to be examined.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par17">Australian parents of an adolescent aged between 12 and 15âyears were eligible to participate. One parent and one teenager per family could take part - registration was done as a dyad. Participants who had undertaken Standard or Youth MHFA or PFA training within the previous three years were ineligible to participate. The study was promoted to parents via newsletters and online communications in secondary schools, ads placed with community organisations (e.g. local libraries, sport centres) and community radio, and links from websites including a study Facebook page. Potential participants were directed to the trial website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tpot.net.au">http://www.tpot.net.au</ext-link>, where they could read about the study and consent to participate. Demographic data were collected during online registration, including a preferred time/day for telephone interview. Participating adolescents provided verbal assent at each interview. Recruitment took place between October 2011 and March 2016.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par18">Randomisation occurred during online registration using a random integer generator programmed on the trial website to give values of 1â=âYMHFA and 2â=âPFA. The program ran immediately after parents selected two potential training dates. Parents were then emailed an electronic copy of their consent form and selected course dates, and informed that they would be contacted in 2â3âweeks to complete their baseline interview. Course allocation was only revealed at the conclusion of the parent interview. Although blinding of parent participants to intervention was not possible, interviewers carrying out the assessments were blinded.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par19">The two training courses were delivered by accredited YMHFA or PFA instructors to groups of parents ranging in size from approximately 5â18. Adolescents did not receive any direct intervention. YMHFA was taught across 4âÃâ3.5âh sessions, usually run over two consecutive days, while PFA was taught over 2 sessions. Parents were given up to four months to attend their allocated course after completing the baseline interview. In July 2014 parents were sent a $50 gift card after course attendance to reimburse travel expenses. This initiative was extended to parents who previously attended their course and remained in the study. Training venues included those currently used by instructors for publicly run YMHFA courses or PFA training (e.g. Red Cross training centres, community centres or school halls). Both control and intervention courses were timetabled to coincide at the same venue in different rooms where possible, or within the same geographical area but at different venues, at similar times. This was to maintain consistency of the course setting while preventing contamination. Both courses included a manual for participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par20">The 14-h YMHFA training teaches adults, who care for or work with adolescents (those aged between 12 and 18âyears), the skills needed to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par21">recognise the early signs of a mental health problem, e.g. depression, anxiety, psychosis, substance use problems or eating disorders;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">identify potential mental health-related crises, e.g. suicidal thoughts and behaviours, non-suicidal self-injury (sometimes called deliberate self-harm), panic attacks, traumatic events, severe psychotic states, acute effects of drug or alcohol use and aggressive behaviours, and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">assist adolescents to get appropriate professional help as early as possible.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par24">A research assistant (JF) performed a fidelity content check for courses conducted by two YMHFA instructors.

Responses were âVery wellâ, âFairly wellâ, âNot wellâ, or âUnsureâ. If the adolescent was unsure what was meant by a âmental health problemâ, they were told âa period of weeks or more when you are feeling depressed, anxious, emotionally stressed, or are misusing alcohol or drugs, and these problems are interfering with your lifeâ. Responses were dichotomised into (1) âVery wellâ versus (0) âFairly wellâ, âNot wellâ, or âUnsureâ.</p>

Secondary outcomes assessed various aspects of parent mental health literacy that would be expected to improve after MHFA training, including recognition of mental health problems, knowledge about youth mental health problems, confidence and intentions to help a person with a mental health problem, stigma towards people with mental health problems, and appropriate help-seeking for mental health problems. In adolescents, secondary outcomes included perceived general social support from parents, intended and actual help-seeking from parents for a mental health problem, help-seeking from a health professional, and stigmatising attitudes.

                <p id="Par31">The required sample size was based on the primary outcome of perceptions of parent support by adolescents who have developed a mental health problem, estimated based on two statistics: (1) the proportion of adolescents who would develop a mental health problem by the first follow-up and (2) the size of the effect of the intervention on perceived support in that sub-group. Based on an analysis of data on past 12-month prevalence of reported depression symptoms in 12â17-year olds in the 2006 National Survey of Youth Mental Health Literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and past 12-month prevalence of anxiety and/or depressive disorders in 16â18âyear olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], we estimated that the 12-month prevalence of mental health problems (anxiety and/or depression symptoms) for the adolescents in this study would be 15.5%. A medium effect size was chosen to evaluate the difference between adolescents who developed a mental health problem, as a smaller effect size may not be practically meaningful. According to Stata Release10, for a repeated measures design, with the change method of sample size calculation and assuming a 0.60 correlation between pre and follow-up measurements, to detect an effect size of dâ=â0.44, with a powerâ=â0.80 and an alphaâ=â0.05, 64 adolescents with a perceived mental health problem would be needed per intervention and control group. To ensure a sufficient sample size to detect the difference between the sub-group of adolescents with a perceived mental health problem, we required a full sample of 413 per group. Increasing the sample size by 20% to account for attrition, the total sample size that was required was 990 adolescent-parent dyads (495 per intervention and control group).</p>

                <p id="Par34">Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle, using mixed-effects models for continuous and binary outcome variables, with group by measurement occasion interactions. This method of analysis is well suited to the data as it takes into account the hierarchical structure of the data, i.e. the correlation of measurement occasions within participants. These maximum likelihood-based methods are able to produce unbiased estimates when a proportion of the participants withdraw before the completion of the study, based on the reasonable assumption that these data are missing at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To help meet the missing at random assumption, parent age and education were included as fixed effects in models analysing parent outcomes, and adolescent SDQ caseness was included in models analysing adolescent outcomes. For continuous outcome measures with no substantial baseline imbalance, effect sizes (Cohenâs d) were calculated by dividing the difference between the two group means at follow-up by their pooled standard deviation. With baseline imbalances, Cohenâs d was calculated by dividing the mean change in each condition by the pooled standard deviation at follow-up. Analyses were performed in Stata 14 and RStudio and the significance level was set at <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â.05.</p>

There were 219 parents (68.0%) with data at 1- or 2-year follow-up. Predictors of missingness at both follow-up assessments were explored with simple logistic regression models. Parents were less likely to be missing at follow-up if they had a tertiary education (ORâ=â0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.93) or were younger in age (ORâ=â0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96).

Just over a quarter of parents indicated that their child had a health issue at baseline, most commonly anxiety (6.8%), asthma (6.5%), depression (3.7%) or ADHD (3.1%).

                <p id="Par37">Parents and adolescents were asked if the adolescent had developed a mental health problem in the past 12âmonths. At baseline, 60 adolescents (20.1%) reported a mental health problem, 32 (17.4%) at 1-year follow-up, and 32 (21.3%) at 2-year follow-up. Parents identified more adolescents with mental health problems: 93 (29.8%) at baseline, 52 (25.7%) at 1-year follow-up, and 54 (30.9%) at 2-year follow-up. Anxiety or depression were the most common problems reported by both. Reports of mental health problems showed moderate stability across time. Of 49 cases of mental health problems reported by adolescents across the follow-up period, 18 (36.7%) were present at baseline. For parents, of the 81 cases reported at 1 or 2âyear follow-up, 40 (49.4%) were present at baseline.</p>

These effects were smaller and no longer significant at 2-year follow-up. No other parent secondary outcomes showed improvements over time relative to the control group. Adolescent secondary outcomes showed no significant differences between groups over time, except for dangerous/unpredictable stigma and K6 psychological distress scores, both of which favoured the

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par42">This study aimed to test whether Youth Mental Health First Aid training received by parents of adolescents led to more effective support towards their adolescent and improved adolescent mental health outcomes. Our results showed no difference between MHFA training and physical first aid training in the quality of support parents provided to adolescents with a mental health problem, irrespective of whether this was assessed from the perspective of the adolescent or parent. Similarly, there was no evidence that Youth MHFA training benefited adolescent mental health as assessed by the SDQ. Secondary outcomes showed a mixed pattern of results, with some outcomes showing benefits, consistent with prior evaluations of MHFA training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These effect sizes were generally somewhat smaller than previously found at up to 6âmonths after training, which is to be expected given the longer follow-up intervals in this study.</p>
              <p id="Par43">A key limitation of this study was a lack of power to detect primary outcome effects. The study did not reach its recruitment target of 990 families and faced greater attrition rates than expected. This meant that the number of adolescents with a mental health problem at follow-up was well below the required 128 to detect a medium effect size, which complicates interpretation of the results. In fact, effects were very small for the quality of mental health first aid that parents provided to adolescents, but effects were in the wrong direction for adolescent perceptions of parental support at 1-year follow-up. The main difficulties in recruiting were because parents found it difficult to commit to a 2-day course or wanted to be able to choose their preferred course type. Other constraints included course cancellations due to low numbers, or parents wishing to reschedule their course date because it no longer suited them. These recruitment difficulties reflect the broader challenge of engaging parents of adolescents in face-to-face group programs associated with their childâs mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Barriers to attending a 2-day training course may have affected some parents disproportionately, such as those who had to travel a greater distance to attend training and for whom time and financial barriers reduced engagement, those who work long hours, or those who do not have access to childcare that would facilitate attendance. A future initiative at MHFA Australia will be a blended eLearning model with only 7âh of face-to-face content, which may reduce these barriers and attract parents in larger numbers.</p>
              <p id="Par44">An alternative interpretation of the pattern of results is that, despite the training improving parentsâ knowledge about youth mental health problems and confidence and intentions to help, this did not translate into better support provided to adolescents. Previous research has shown that mental health first aid intentions positively predict behaviours at follow-up (râ=â0.27) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This study found the same strength of association between baseline intentions and support provided at 2-year follow-up (râ=â0.27), but no association between baseline and 1-year follow-up (râ=âââ0.04). It is acknowledged that there are other factors important in the link between intentions and behaviour beyond having sufficient knowledge and confidence in what to do. Qualitative research on the process of providing mental health first aid shows that many factors influence the decision to provide help and the best help to offer, including the relationship between helper and recipient, the helperâs feelings of responsibility, personality, experience and values, and the recipientâs readiness for help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Factors such as relationship quality could be measured in future studies of MHFA to determine whether they moderate the provision of support. In addition, further qualitative research to understand what barriers may prevent parents from implementing MHFA with their children would be useful. These may be important to target in future revisions to course content.</p>
              <p id="Par45">While parents are a target for training in Youth MHFA, most courses are delivered to professional groups. Training is frequently run for high school staff, including teachers, administrators and ancillary staff. An advantage of this model is that school staff have contact with many young people each year, can support each other to provide mental health first aid, and can seek the assistance of another school staff member if specific interpersonal barriers exist between themselves and the student. The presence of family conflict (which may arise as a by-product of a mental health problem) could make it difficult for a parent to assist their child. In addition, parents may only have contact with one adolescent that is both regular enough and intense enough to recognise a problem, whereas school staff may be in a better position to recognise patterns of behaviour, having a larger sample of adolescents to observe over time. The training is also run in other community settings such as sports clubs. Adults in these settings may have less formal relationships with the young people they interact with, making them another good target. Like school staff, they are likely to encounter many adolescents each year, increasing the likelihood of having the opportunity to offer mental health first aid.</p>
              <p id="Par46">This study has several strengths. It was rigorously designed with an active control condition and a long period of follow-up for a mental health education course. Furthermore, the impact of training was targeted towards a key period of life when the first-onset of mental disorders is high and early intervention would be most beneficial. Including parent and adolescent dyads also allowed for the direct measurement of MHFA effects on the recipient of aid, rather than relying solely on indirect reports from first aiders. As stated above, the main limitation was being underpowered, but additionally the primary outcome of adolescent perception of parental support for their mental health problem was developed for this study and has not been validated. Using a single-item with a limited response scale may not have been sensitive enough to the effects of MHFA training. Future research could explore a more nuanced or objective measure suitable for use with young adolescents.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par47">Ultimately, the question of whether MHFA training leads to better outcomes in the recipients of aid remains to be further explored. Although approaching a person, listening to their concerns and providing them with emotional support is perceived to be helpful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the full benefits from providing mental health first aid may only be realised when the recipient obtains professional help and receives an adequate course of treatment. It is known that many people do not receive a minimum dose of an evidence-based treatment when receiving mental health care, which remains a broader challenge to solve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
