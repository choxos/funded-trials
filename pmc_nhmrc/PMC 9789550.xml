                  <p id="Par1">Transdisciplinary approaches can streamline processes and build workforce capacity by blurring traditional responsibilities and integrating aspects of care. Emerging evidence shows transdisciplinary approaches can improve time-efficiency, quality of care and cost-effectiveness across various healthcare settings, however no empirical study is based on an acute stroke unit.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The SPIRIT checklist was used to guide the content of the research protocol. The study is a pragmatic pre−/post- mixed method<strike>s</strike> four-phase study with a 3-month follow up, based at the Mater Hospital Brisbane. Participants experiencing stroke symptoms will be recruited as they are admitted to the acute stroke unit. Patients presenting with mild stroke symptoms or Transient Ischaemic Attack will be allocated to Phase 1 (baseline) or Phase 2 (implementation), while patients presenting with moderate to severe stroke symptoms will be allocated to Phase 3 (baseline) or Phase 4 (implementation). Participants in baseline Phases 1 and 3 will receive standard allied health assessment, while participants in implementation Phases 2 and 4 will receive the novel transdisciplinary assessment. For the primary aim, allied health professionals will time their assessments to evaluate time taken to administer a novel transdisciplinary assessment, compared to usual discipline-specific assessments. Non-inferiority of the novel transdisciplinary assessment will also be explored in terms of patient safety, compliance to national standards, use of the assessment, and stakeholder perceptions. A retrospective medical record audit, staff focus group, patient/staff surveys, and patient phone interviews at 3-months will be completed. Quantitative results will be estimated using general linear and logistic regression models in Stata 15.1. Qualitative results will be analysed using frequency counts and NVivo software. An economic evaluation will be performed using three scopes including the allied health assessment, hospital admission, and patient outcomes at 3-months.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">When designing the study, pragmatic factors related to staff willingness to be involved, patient safety, and existing clinical pathways/processes were considered. To address those factors, a co-design approach was taken, resulting in staff buy-in, clinically relevant outcome measures, and the pre−/post- four-phase study design.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">Allied health professionals (AHPs) are central to the provision of quality stroke services. The Australian stroke guidelines state that all people experiencing stroke should receive physiotherapist assessment within 24–48 hours of admission to hospital, and assessment by occupational therapists and speech pathologists within 48 hours of admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While each AHP has a clearly defined role, overlapping skills and knowledge result in some assessment tasks and questions being administered repeatedly by different clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. At the Mater Hospital Brisbane (MHB) Acute Stroke Unit (ASU), the physiotherapist, occupational therapist, and speech pathologist assess patients presenting with stroke separately. However, these discipline-specific assessments overlap, for example the physiotherapist and occupational therapist both assess upper limb function and gather information on previous level of function and the home environment. Such duplication across allied health assessments is unnecessary, inefficient, and AHP time could be better utilised.</p>
              <p id="Par16">A transdisciplinary approach to allied health stroke assessment could streamline AHP services, which is pertinent given the increasing consumer demand for stroke care. In Australia, the number of new stroke diagnoses per year is predicted to grow from 27,000 in 2020 to exceed 50,000 by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Transdisciplinary approaches are defined by their potential to build workforce capacity by blurring lines of traditional responsibilities and integrating aspects of care (such as assessment) to enable a single team member to deliver the occasion of service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is emerging evidence that demonstrates, when compared to usual care, hospital-based allied health transdisciplinary teams improve AHP time-efficiency, quality of care, and are cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. No negative or harmful outcomes were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. When pilot testing the allied health transdisciplinary assessment to be used in this study, the authors demonstrated a mean time saving of 103 minutes when the transdisciplinary assessment was used (42 minutes), compared to usual single-dicipline assessments (145 minutes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A time saving of 103 minutes could be clinically significant. For example, AHPs would have more time available to commence rehabilitation earlier in the patient episode of care, thereby aligning the service more closely with national stroke guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The pilot testing served as proof of concept for the study proposed in this paper. To the author’s knowledge, no other empirical studies have evaluated transdisciplinary approaches on ASUs. Due to the low volume of empirical evidence pertaining to transdisciplinary approaches on ASUs, alongside the potential for transdisciplinary approaches to streamline stroke services, empirical research is warranted in this field.</p>

                <p id="Par18">The primary aim of this research is to understand the benefits (or otherwise) of implementing a novel Transdisciplinary Initial Neurological Screening Assessment (TINSA) on the MHB ASU. We hypothesise that compared to the existing discipline-specific allied health stroke assessments, utilising the TINSA will reduce allied health assessment time by at least 20 minutes during the initial occasion of service, without reducing quality of care. Secondary aims are to evaluate use of AHP time across the participant hospital admission, quality of care provided by AHPs in terms of patient safety and compliance to national stroke guidelines, clinical utility of the novel TINSA, economic implications of implementing the novel TINSA, patient and staff satisfaction, staff interprofessional trust, and staff confidence to complete and share transdisciplinary tasks.</p>

                <p id="Par20">The clinical study of the TINSA is a pragmatic pre−/post four-phase mixed methods study with non-randomised comparative groups, a convergent parallel design, and longitudinal follow-up at 3-months after hospital admission. The main quantitative element of the study incorporates descriptive and cross-sectional analytic components and measures designed to evaluate and compare four periods of time during which existing and new transdisciplinary stroke assessments are evaluated (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Only the allied health stroke assessment component of the patient admission to the MHB ASU will be evaluated, and subsequent allied health input will continue as per usual care. Phase 1 (baseline, usual care) and Phase 2 (implementation of TINSA) will recruit participants experiencing symptoms of mild stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) and evaluate usual assessment compared to the novel TINSA (respectively). Between Phases 1 and 2, a 1-month transition phase will take place to allow staff to become familiar with the novel TINSA, complete competency training, and practice the new clinical process. Phase 3 (baseline, usual care) and Phase 4 (implementation of TINSA) will recruit participants experiencing moderate to severe stroke symptoms to evaluate usual assessment compared to the novel TINSA (respectively). Phases 3 and 4 will occur in parallel with Phase 2 and be time-limited (3 months/phase) due to time constraints on the ASU. Due to the nature of the clinical processes and staffing on the MHB ASU, neither randomisation nor blinding are feasible.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Transdisciplinary study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2022_8926_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

Across all Phases, on day 1 of admission to the MHB ASU, patient participants will be recruited using convenience sampling (i.e., as they are admitted). To identify participants who meet the eligibility criteria, the physiotherapists and/or occupational therapists will review the admitting doctor note in the patient medical record. Participants will be provided with a Participant Information and Consent Form and will provide written consent if agreeing to take part in the study (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Where it is not possible to obtain written consent due to quick discharge from hospital (i.e., before day 2 on the acute stroke unit when consent is obtained), verbal consent will be obtained via phone call, as approved by the ethics committee. On day 2 of admission, eligible patient participants will be asked to partake in a satisfaction survey. At 3-months after admission to hospital eligible participants (and/or authorised representatives) will receive a follow-up phone call to measure functional outcomes and quality of life.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Recruitment timeline for patients and staff</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2022_8926_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

Compared to usual discipline-specific assessment, we seek to determine the change in engagement of hospital resources when the novel TINSA is utilised with patients experiencing stroke. We expect the potential cost-saving to occur at the initial assessment phase of the hospital admission, while other costs incurred during or after the hospital admission will not be affected. The mean cost per patient will be calculated using a decision tree analysis with expected values calculated from observed patient scenarios. To do this, the analysis will take the approach of analysing outcomes in 3 different scopes from the perspective of the health sector (i.e., MHB where the study will take place). Scope 1 will evaluate the initial assessment phase of the hospital admission. Use of resources including AHP time and bed space will be evaluated using AHP assessment times and hospital coded data. Scope 2 will encompass the entire acute hospital admission (inclusive of Scope 1) with multiple measures available from patient medical records and administrative data collection such as occasions of service by AHPs, counts of adverse events (e.g., aspiration pneumonia), and hospital cost per diem (including equipment, consumables, maintenance, and overheads). Scope 3 will be the broadest view, evaluated 3-months after admission to the MHB ASU. In this scope, an extended healthcare perspective will be used, where relevant health costs and healthcare consequences for the patient post-discharge will be considered. For example, counts of adverse events (e.g., number of falls and unplanned readmissions to hospital), quality of life at 3 months measured using the EQ-5D-3L, and increased reliance on informal/formal supports will be compared between groups and (where possible) compared to national medians/means reported by the Australian Clinical Stroke Registry (AuSCR). A one-way sensitivity analysis will be performed to evaluate uncertainty in the cost estimates regarding the TINSA. For example, the costs of AHPs will be examined at the low and high ends of the clinical pay scale for the MHB ASU (e.g., from Health Practitioner Level 3.1 to Level 7.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; the time of the TINSA assessment will be varied to represent two standard deviations above the mean (i.e., the scenario where costs calculated account for 95% of observations); and length of stay will be varied to represent two standard deviations above/below the mean to capture changes in hospital cost per diem (including equipment, consumables, maintenance, and overheads) for 95% of observations.</p>

                <p id="Par45">During the study period, the MHB ASU team will take on the role of the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC). The DMSC will meet each fortnight to review study conduct and patient safety. The pre-specified review, stopping and discontinuation rules include if 1) data are collected, managed and/or stored outside of the planned methods; 2) data is unable to be de-identified; and 3) there is an increase in adverse outcomes including patient falls, missed allied health referrals and/or failed discharges during Phases 2 or 4 (TINSA implementation) when compared to Phases 1 or 3 (baseline). If adverse outcomes are deemed to have occurred because of the study, use of the TINSA will cease, patients will receive usual care, and any serious adverse events will be reported through the hospital procedure channels and to the institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par47">Originality of the study was considered and influenced study design. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first empirical study to evaluate a transdisciplinary approach on an ASU. Due to the novel setting, it was important to acknowledge the potential for an efficiency-quality trade-off, even though transdisciplinary approaches in other healthcare settings (such as medical wards or community settings) have been shown to improve time-efficiency and achieve improved or equivalent quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the study has a dual focus on time-efficiency and quality of care, recognising that earlier and faster assessment should not be at the expense of the quality of AHP assessment, patient safety, or patient outcomes. Accordingly, a range of time-efficiency and quality outcomes are included in the study.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Pragmatic factors related to capacity and willingness of AHPs to be involved in the research, patient safety when receiving the transdisciplinary assessment, and integration of the transdisciplinary approach with existing clinical pathways were also considered when designing the clinical study. To address these factors, a co-design approach between researchers and clinicians was taken. Firstly, the co-design approach secured clinical staff buy-in and involvement in the research. For example, the AHPs contributed to the development of the novel TINSA and study design, increasing investment and willingness to participate in data collection by recording their assessment time.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Secondly, the co-design approach resulted in a feasible and robust study design that mitigated potential implementation barriers, including concerns for patient safety. AHPs were concerned for the scenario where a patient with moderate to severe stroke is being assessed by a clinician who is working outside of their usual scope of practice (e.g., an occupational therapist completing the initial mobility assessment). To mitigate the concerns, the four-phase study design was selected as it allows for staged implementation of the novel TINSA. In other words, initially the TINSA will only be used with patients experiencing TIA/mild stroke symptoms. This will provide staff with time and opportunity to practice the TINSA, become comfortable and confident, and gain perspective regarding how the TINSA could be suitable and safe for patients experiencing more severe stroke.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Consulting with staff also ensured clinically meaningful outcome measures and an appropriate study design were selected. As all AHPs need to know what assessment is being completed with patients (i.e., the novel TINSA or discipline-specific assessments), a blinded study was not possible. Furthermore, parallel study groups (as required for a Randomised Controlled Trial) were not practical. Parallel study groups would require two clinical pathways for the assessment and management of stroke patients. Treating one patient group using two clinical pathways was viewed as confusing, would risk inconsistent care and missed assessments, and complicate clinical handover between AHPs. Additionally, study results obtained from parallel groups might not reflect the “real-world” where only one clinical pathway is used. For example, staff satisfaction responses could be skewed, where staff reflect on the experience of navigating two clinical pathways rather than reflecting on the experience of utilising the TINSA. Or time-efficiency results might not be accurate, as AHPs would take extra time to determine which patient is on what clinical pathway.</p>

                <title>Limitations and implications</title>
                <p id="Par51">There is one main limitation of the study. This is a single-centre study, which means the processes undertaken in developing and carrying out this research might not be suitable in other clinical settings without adaptation and consideration of the local context. The novel TINSA has been developed by AHPs (content experts) at the MHB. While the AHPs have clinical experience at MHB as well as external settings, the novel TINSA has been tailored for the MHB ASU. Adaption and consideration of the local context would be required before implementing and evaluating the novel TINSA in other settings. Despite this, the protocol paper is intended to provide a platform and guide future empirical transdisciplinary research.</p>
