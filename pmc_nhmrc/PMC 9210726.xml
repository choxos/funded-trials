                  <p id="Par1">Government-subsidised general practice management plans (GPMPs) facilitate chronic disease management; however, impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown. We aimed to determine utilisation and impact of GPMPs for people with or at elevated risk of CVD.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Secondary analysis of baseline data from the CONNECT randomised controlled trial linked to Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) claims. Multivariate regression examining the association of GPMP receipt and review with: (1)ââ¥â1 MBS-subsidised allied health visit in the previous 24Â months; (2) adherence to dual cardioprotective medication (â¥â80% of days covered with a dispensed PBS prescription); and (3) meeting recommended LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure (BP) targets concurrently.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Overall, 905 trial participants from 24 primary health care services consented to data linkage. Participants with a GPMP (46.6%, 422/905) were older (69.4 vs 66.0Â years), had lower education (32.3% vs 24.7% high school or lower), lower household income (27.5% vs 17.0% in lowest bracket), and more comorbidities, particularly diabetes (42.2% vs 17.6%) compared to those without a GPMP. After adjustment, a GPMP was strongly associated with allied health visits (odds ratio (OR) 14.80, 95% CI: 9.08â24.11) but not higher medication adherence rates (OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.52â1.29) nor meeting combined LDL and BP targets (OR 1.31, 95% CI: 0.72â2.38). Minor differences in significant covariates were noted in models using GPMP review versus GPMP initiation.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">In people with or at elevated risk of CVD, GPMPs are under-utilised overall. They are targeting high-needs populations and facilitate allied health access, but are not associated with improved CVD risk management, which represents an opportunity for enhancing their value in supporting guideline-recommended care.</p>

              <p id="Par17">More than 47% of Australians are affected by at least one chronic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which may require coordination of care across multiple providers. In Australia, chronic conditions are mostly managed in primary health care via a range of providers including general practitioners (GPs), registered nurses, allied health professionals, and Aboriginal Health Practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Australiaâs health care system is a hybrid of private and public health care provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Basic coverage for health care services is provided under Medicare, the universal health care scheme for citizens and other eligible groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Free or low-cost services are provided by federal, state, and local levels of government; each level has responsibilities that are specific to their jurisdiction and some activities are shared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) subsidises most GP consultations and some ambulatory care services including some allied health services; other primary health care tends to be funded by private, state or territory governments, and non-government sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Health services that are not fully covered under the MBS scheme, or for which the provider charges above the scheduled fee, incur an out-of-pocket (gap) charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; private health insurance may offset some out-of-pocket costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The federally-funded Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is a co-payment scheme facilitating prescription medication affordability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

              <p id="Par18">For people with chronic health conditions, Medicare subsidises structured assessment, planning, and multidisciplinary care under the chronic disease management plan initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Within this initiative, a GP can initiate a general practice management plan (GPMP) which is a documented comprehensive description of the care needs, management goals, action, treatment, and service arrangements and reviews for the relevant condition(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Further, a team care arrangement (TCA) documents coordination of care required from at least three providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The original enhanced primary care initiative for chronic and complex care commenced in 1999 and in 2004â2005 underwent significant expansion of provisions for aged care, Aboriginal health, and allied health access. With a GPMP in place, the recipient is allowed MBS-subsidised attendance of up to five allied health visits per calendar year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previous research on the impact of GPMP items demonstrated mixed outcomes with limited effectiveness for multi-provider collaboration; they were mainly used for administrative purposes rather than clinical motivations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. From 2006â2014 there was an overall doubling in the proportion of initial claims for GPMP or TCA (11.3% to 22.4%), with the highest uptake found: (i) in those aged 80â84Â years; (ii) in people with diabetes; (iii) in those with lower physical functioning; and (iv) in people on lower incomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>

In adults with diabetes, three subsidised items were associated with reduced all-cause hospitalisations: an annual cycle of diabetes care; review but not initiation of a GPMP/TCA; and multidisciplinary care, in particular from ophthalmology, a practice nurse, and podiatry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Confounding factors notwithstanding, active careâexpressed as proactive health reviews and early and ongoing preventive careâ appeared more protective against hospital admissions than care plan initiation alone. In older adults with heart failure, having a GPMP was associated with a 23% reduction in the rate of preventable heart failure hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; also delayed time to, and reduced rate of, hospitalisation for any cardiovascular or respiratory cause. In contrast, another study found that for a general population with chronic diseases, there was no association between a GPMP claimed within a two-year baseline service utilisation period and potentially preventable hospitalisations in the subsequent five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A study looking at uptake of five or more physiotherapy claims under a GPMP in patients aged 85Â years or older found this was associated with fewer avoidable hospitalisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

A priori variables, selected from review of literature and expert clinician input, included sex, age, education level, income, attainment of clinical targets (when studying medication adherence), medication adherence (when studying attainment of clinical targets), and ten comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, diabetes, depression, and asthma). Three BRT models were developed to quantify the influence of variables used to distinguish the groups with and without a GPMP for the three outcomes of interest. Variables were ranked in order of relative influence and the topmost variables were included in the multivariable regression. Highly correlated variables were removed or interchanged based on the BRT rankings. Multivariable regression was performed using this final subset of variables and practice level random effect. Three additional multivariable models were created using GPMP review instead of GPMP receipt, and retaining the same variables for comparative purposes. Categorical exposure variables were modelled using linear terms and their effects illustrated using forest plots of the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals displayed with density strips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par39">This study examined baseline data from the CONNECT RCT to evaluate the relationship between provision of a GPMP and uptake of multidisciplinary care, adherence to medications, and attainment of clinical targets in patients with or at elevated risk of CVD. Overall, nearly half (46.6%) of participants had a GPMP claimed in the previous 24Â months. People with a GPMP tended to be older, more financially disadvantaged, and have more comorbidities compared to those without a GPMP. This suggests GPs are targeting this service to people who might benefit most, although arguably the whole study population at high risk of CVD could be considered high need. Those with a GPMP had higher GP visit frequency, increased use of health assessments, mental health care plans, and nearly six-fold higher uptake of allied health services. However, neither GPMP receipt nor review, nor visit frequency was associated with medication adherence and clinical targets. We contend that the plan could be strengthened as a tool for greater risk factor control in the context of chronic disease management. Interestingly, although 42.2% of GPMP recipients had diabetes, less than 12% of all allied health claims were for diabetes education or dietitian services. Most claims (63.7%) were for podiatry and physiotherapy, perhaps reflecting personal preferences and/or the use of other channels to obtain services. These findings build on a previous study using GP electronic medical record data where we lacked access to patient socio-demographic data and linkage to PBS records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">Conversely, a GPMP was not associated with improved adherence to guideline recommended medications or attainment of clinical targets. Although GPMPs are intended to encompass care assessment, agreed management goals, actions, and treatment needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], they appear mainly to be used as a pathway to MBS-subsidised multidisciplinary care. To achieve their broader intent, GPMPs may need a more explicit focus on supporting guideline-recommended care, with an emphasis on quality use of medications and lifestyle recommendations that are known to substantially reduce CVD risk. Within the recently launched primary health care 10-year plan, Voluntary Patient Registration with a general practice is an included reform to strengthen continuity of care and improve health outcomes. This will include payment reforms to support preventive care, quality improvement, and quarantining payment for chronic disease management to the registering practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This provides opportunities to (re-)emphasise disease management within GPMPs, in line with their stated purpose.</p>
              <p id="Par41">In contrast with previous studies, the number of GP visits did not influence adherence to lipid-lowering medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A more granular evaluation of factors beyond our study scope including recency of diagnoses, visit regularity (in addition to visit frequency) and care continuity could help understand this complex association. Neither GPMP initiation nor review was associated with higher rates of dispensed CVD medication. This is consistent with published literature suggesting that multifaceted provider and consumer focussed strategies are needed to address this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The number of medication reviews claimed in this study was minor and their role in the CVD outcomes of interest could not be determined. Although physician time spent discussing medications with patients may signal improved processes of care, the benefit may apply to particular subgroups such as older age and type of CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Innovative tools to overcome adherence barriers include patient portals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], smartphone applications that facilitate self-monitoring, alerts/reminders, and enhanced interaction with health care professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although not currently incorporated into a GPMP, such activities offer possibilities for modifying the approach to CVD medication management.</p>
              <p id="Par42">There was also no association between a GPMP, or a GPMP review, and attainment of both BP and lipid control targets. Similarly, an Australian trial of an individualised care plan, implemented by the GP and a nurse, and formatted and reimbursed similarly to the existing GP care plan scheme for chronic conditions, did not achieve attainment of six national cardiometabolic risk factorÂ targets in secondary stroke prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the cohort with elevated CVD risk within this analysis, the number of different medications required and prescription-filling behaviour were associated with attainment of risk factor control. This again underscores the importance of proactive medication adherence management plans to minimise barriers to optimal use of medicines. Improved control of LDL cholesterol and BP has been reported with, for example, mobile phone-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. When teamed with other government-supported programs such as home medicines reviews, practice quality improvement incentive programs, and primary health network quality improvement collaboratives, GPMPs could be optimised for medication adherence. Within multifaceted approaches, substantial and cost-effective reductions in CVD burden are possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par43">Study limitations include that the participants in this study who received a GPMP for a non-CVD condition â for example participants at high risk for CVD but with another diagnosed chronic conditionâmay have attained important outcomes that are unknown from these data. However, it is important to note in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>that the vast majority of people both with and without CVD had a large range of comorbid chronic conditions and that several of the clinical criteria for classification of high-risk CVD include type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and presence of albuminuria. Also, allied health services delivered privately or within public hospitals such as outpatient cardiac rehabilitation, may not attract MBS reimbursement and will lead to an underestimate of the overall use of allied health care in this study. Oral antiplatelet medications for CVD prevention were omitted from the analyses because the widely used first-line treatment (aspirin) can be obtained without a prescription, unlike agents added for treatment intensification. The PBS does not collect data about over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin, or about medications purchased via private prescriptions. Notably, more than half (54.6%) of the participants in this study with a GPMP were health care- or DVA card holders; one advantage of obtaining medications via the PBS is the contribution these make toward eligibility for the Safety Net entitlement â both for concession card holders and general patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A consumer may prefer a private prescription, perhaps to avoid a prescription record in the PBS; however, private prescriptions for lipid- and blood pressure-lowering medications were unlikely to be influential in this study context and were not explored. The CONNECT trial took place in primary care services within Sydney, and use of enhanced primary care services has been noted to be lower in metropolitan than regional areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par44">In conclusion, although under-utilised overall, government-subsidised GPMPs initiated for a chronic condition in a population at high CVD risk were prioritised for the highest needs patients and primarily to support access to multidisciplinary care. They were not associated with improvements in guideline-recommended CVD medication use and risk factor control. As the government launches its primary health care 10-year plan, an increased emphasis is recommended on using GPMPs to proactively improve guideline-recommended care for people with diagnosed CVD, or with one or more other chronic conditions and at elevated risk of CVD. GPMPs were designed to improve provision of chronic disease care needs, management goals, action, treatment, and service arrangements and reviews; yet this study found little evidence that they are impacting these broader elements and have become mainly a conduit to accessing allied health services. We contend that a more comprehensive application of the GPMP such as shared decision-making, comprehensive chronic care management, and team-based support could increase their value beyond allied health use.</p>
