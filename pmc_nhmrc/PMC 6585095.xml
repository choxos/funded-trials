                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Australia is one of many nations struggling with the challenges of delivering quality primary health care (PHC) to increasing numbers of refugees. The OPTIMISE project represents a collaboration between 12 organisations to generate a model of integrated refugee PHC suitable for uptake throughout Australia. This paper describes the methodology of one component; an outreach practice facilitation intervention, directed towards improving the quality of PHC received by refugees in Australian general practices.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Our mixed methods study will use a cluster stepped wedge randomised controlled trial design set in 3 urban regions of high refugee resettlement in Australia.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The intervention was build upon regional partnerships of policy advisors, clinicians, academics and health service managers. Following a regional needs assessment, the partnerships reached consensus on four core areas for intervention in general practice (GP): recording of refugee status; using interpreters; conducting comprehensive health assessments; and referring to refugee specialised services.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Refugee health staff trained in outreach practice facilitation techniques will work with GP clinics to modify practice routines relating to the four core areas.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">36 general practice clinics with no prior involvement in a refugee health focused practice facilitation will be randomly allocated into early and late intervention groups.</p>
                  <p id="Par6">The primary outcome will be changes in number of claims for Medical Benefit Service reimbursed comprehensive health assessments among patients identified as being from a refugee background. Changes in practice performance for this and 3 secondary outcomes will be evaluated using multilevel mixed effects models.</p>
                  <p id="Par7">Baseline data collection will comprise (i) pre-intervention provider survey; (ii) two surveys documenting each practices’ structure and approaches to delivery of care to refugees. De-identified medical record data will be collected at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 6 and 12 months following completion.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par8">OPTIMISE will test whether a regionally oriented practice facilitation initiative can improve the quality of PHC delivered to refugees. Findings have the potential to influence policy and practice in broader primary care settings.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par22">Australia is a major site for the resettlement of refugees. Over 78,000 permanent resident visas were granted to refugees and asylum seekers between 2011 and 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The nation’s refugee and humanitarian program intake has recently increased (in 2018/19) to 18,750 per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the majority of whom will settle in the states of New South Wales and Victoria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">The vulnerability of Australians of a refugee background follows from the physical and psychological sequelae of torture, trauma and multiple deprivations in countries of origin and transit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Compared to the wider population, refugees are at greater risk of mental health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], infectious disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], nutritional deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], obstetric complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], poor dental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Complex physical and psychological problems are often addressed only for the first time in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">Australian states and territories have introduced different approaches to aid transition to life in a new country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pathways vary across regions within different states/territories, and, as to whether refugees arrive through a sponsored or non-sponsored pathway. However, in general, resettled refugees are initially put in contact with Commonwealth funded Humanitarian Settlement Program service providers, which provide practical assistance for settling in the community. In many jurisdictions, new arrivals may be directed to Refugee Focused Health Services and/or a mainstream General Practice for initial health assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Subsequently, all but the most complex clients are managed within mainstream primary care.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The health and wellbeing of people of refugee background is intimately linked with their ability to access high quality, coordinated primary health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many struggle to access general practitioners, specialists, community health services and hospitals – problems related to socio-economic factors, language and cultural differences and the complexity of the Australian healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Provision of quality care to refugee background patients in mainstream primary care has been found to be inconsistent, with many providers having incomplete knowledge of refugee health requirements. Interpreters are underutilised, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], coordination between sectors problematic, and, at times, in some jurisdictions, Refugee Focused Health Services have found it difficult to provide timely care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Outreach practice facilitation has become a promising intervention to support quality improvement in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Practice facilitation has been shown to improve chronic disease management, increase prevention, and facilitate system-level change and quality improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Emerging evidence has shown that the principles of outreach practice facilitation could assist in the care of vulnerable populations, including refugees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This protocol outlines a project designed to investigate the effectiveness of outreach practice facilitation in supporting primary care practice-wide quality improvement within the context of refugee health.</p>

Quantitative measures collected cross-sectionally at multiple timepoints will be assessed using the recommended statistical approach for step-wedged cRCT designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. An embedded qualitative component will explore the acceptability, usefulness and sustainability of the intervention(s).</p>
                <p id="Par35">The study will be informed by the literature on organisational change that identifies the factors influencing the diffusion and institutionalisation of organisational innovations, and where organisations are considered as a whole rather than as a set of independent attributes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Two principles underpin the study design: a) Participatory research: where community based research partnerships built upon on-going knowledge exchange are considered an essential component of sustainable innovations and, community impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; and b) Implementation science: incorporating contemporary approaches to quality improvement, and, in particular Normalization Process Theory’s principles for understanding the process of embedding change in a practice by examining what people actually do and how they work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par36">The study will be conducted in general practice clinics in two regions of metropolitan Melbourne and one region in metropolitan Sydney, each with high rates of refugee resettlement. The study regions correspond to the Commonwealth Government Primary Health Networks (PHN) regions of South East Melbourne, North West Melbourne and South West Sydney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              </sec>

                <title>Sample</title>
                <p id="Par37">Trial eligibility is at three levels. Participating general practice clinics will be located in one of the three PHN regions, provide general primary care services and plan to be in operation for the next two years without substantial change to governance or management. Each will have needed to be in operation for 12 months and use electronic medical records and billing software compatible with the study’s data extraction tool (PENCS CAT4<bold>™</bold>). Practices will not have participated in refugee health related capacity building activities in the 12 months immediately preceding the study.</p>
                <p id="Par38">At least 50% of GPs in a practice must consent for practice participation to be confirmed. As the intervention is designed around a whole-of-practice approach, the research team will ensure there is a process by which staff within the practice can confidentially object to the practice’s participation in the study, via call or email. If this occurs, the practice will be withdrawn from the study.</p>

                  <title>Development of the intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par39">The oversight of the study’s activities in each region is the responsibility of regional partnership teams (RPTs) comprising decision makers, clinicians, academics, health service managers and community members (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Participating organisations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Regional Partnership</th><th>Academic Institutions</th><th>Primary Health Organisations</th><th>Refugee Focused Health Services</th><th>Settlement agencies</th><th>State based organisations</th><th>National organisations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>South East Melbourne</td><td>Monash University</td><td><p>Enliven Victoria</p><p>2016–2017: South Eastern Health Providers Association</p></td><td>Monash Health Refugee Health and Wellbeing</td><td rowspan="2">AMES Australia</td><td rowspan="2"><p>Victorian Department of Health and Human Services</p><p>Victorian Refugee Health Network</p></td><td rowspan="3"><p>Royal Australian College of General Practitioners</p><p>Refugee Health Network of Australia</p></td></tr><tr><td>North West Melbourne</td><td>La Trobe University</td><td>North Western Melbourne PHN.</td><td>cohealth</td></tr><tr><td>South West Sydney</td><td>University of New South Wales</td><td>South Western Sydney PHN.</td><td>NSW Refugee Health Service</td><td>Settlement Services International</td><td>NSW Refugee Health Service</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                  <p id="Par40">Each RPT worked to characterise each region’s policy, program and service context with particular reference to the care of refugee populations. We focused specifically on barriers and enablers affecting access, transition and quality of primary care within the region. To further understand regional partnership needs, each RPT performed a focused scientific and grey literature review, analysed secondary data extracted from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Census, Department of Home Affairs Settlement Reporting Facility, settlement agencies, public health services and local councils, and conducted a series of key informant interviews with health service managers, policy advisors and clinicians. The three RPTs then met in a deliberative forum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] to determine priority interventions, from which four core areas of activity were chosen;<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par41"><underline>Physical and mental health assessments</underline>: GPs and practice nurses will have relevant skills and knowledge to conduct comprehensive refugee physical and mental health assessments.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42"><underline>Refugee identification</underline>: general practice clinics will have accurate and accessible mechanisms in place to record and retrieve refugee identification, status, country of birth or ethnicity, year of arrival, and need for interpreter.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43"><underline>Use of interpreters</underline>: practices will have a practice protocol for using interpreters, and ensure that staff have appropriate knowledge and skills in their role of supporting use of interpreters<bold>.</bold></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44"><underline>Referral pathways</underline>: practice staff will gain an understanding of refugee health referral pathways in the region (including available services, eligibility requirements and referral procedures).</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par45">These areas of focus helped the study objectives (see above). All practices recruited will be asked to work on these four core areas as a minimum, with the option to choose an additional 1–2 activities from a list of optional tasks depending on interest and capacity (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Intervention Optional activities</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cultural awareness</td><td>Practice staff demonstrate cultural awareness and sensitivity to refugee issues, including an understanding of the refugee experience.</td></tr><tr><td>Communication skills</td><td>GPs and practice nurses have appropriate communication skills (They are sensitive to the needs of refugees and take time to explain care to patients so they can make informed decisions by understanding what is happening as part of their care).</td></tr><tr><td>Business practices</td><td>practice staff are knowledgeable about and use business practices (including longer appointments, booking appointment with specific GP, Medicare billing, etc.) to support conduct of refugee health assessments</td></tr><tr><td>Information sharing</td><td>Practice has in place clear processes for sharing relevant patient information with other services.

                  <title>Intervention process</title>
                  <p id="Par46">Practice Facilitators will deliver the intervention to general practice clinics using a plan/do/study/act (PDSA) approach oriented to the four core goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Practice Facilitators will make a minimum of three, 60–90 min, in-person contacts with each participating practice during the six-month intervention period. Practices will receive one telephone contact following each visit.</p>
                  <p id="Par47">Prior to the intervention commencing, each practice will identify a team comprising the practice lead and key practice participants, including at least one GP and (if applicable) one practice nurse. The team will complete a survey designed to ascertain current practice performance and needs in key areas of refugee health. This information will be used to help the Practice Facilitator lead a discussion during their first visit to the practice where the practice team will identify and discuss potential needs and areas for action, and develop an action plan (following a pre-designed template) for each of the four core priority areas. The action plans were adapted from the Victorian Refugee Health Network’s <italic>Engaging and supporting General Practice in refugee health</italic> program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and an example can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">The subsequent two practice facilitation visits and phone calls will act to support and monitor action plan development and implementation. The Practice Facilitator will continue to assist with challenges faced by the practice and identify any other resources, strategies, tools or training available to aid in the action plan’s implementation.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">Practices will also be provided with additional resources relating to the four core priority areas, including a soft and hard copy of a “General Practice Resource Book”. This book was created by the research team to provide a directory of verified resources organised to complement the four goals targeted by the project. A two-page electronic ‘summary sheet’ of key resources, with links embedded to be easily accessed on electronic devices, will also be provided.</p>

However, if practice-level clustering is indicated, then the mixed models will include a cluster-specific random effect to deal with clustering at the practice level. In the main analysis the independent variables defined as fixed effects will be group allocation (1 = early, 0 = late), intervention status (0 = pre-intervention, 1 = post-intervention) and timepoint (0 = baseline for all practices, 1 = post intervention for early practices, pre-intervention for late start practices, 2 = 6 months post intervention for early practices, post intervention for late start practices, 3 = 6 months post intervention for late practices).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par98">A co-designed, practice facilitation intervention is an innovative approach to improve key refugee background patient outcomes in 36 practices in regions with the highest refugee settlement in Australia.</p>
              <p id="Par99">The findings of the research described in this paper will generate evidence for the effectiveness and limitations of a practice facilitation approach to quality improvement in general practice. This will add to the evolving body of knowledge around the implementation of practice facilitation, particularly whole-of-practice changes that impact on access to quality primary health care for vulnerable populations. It will also generate evidence about the approach to facilitate improvements in the delivery of primary care to people of refugee background.</p>
              <p id="Par100">Data on the intervention will generate valuable knowledge concerning the effectiveness of outreach practice facilitation in optimising the primary care of people of refugee background in Australia. If successful, it will deliver quality, accessible and coordinated PHC care to refugees. Primary care clinicians, especially those working within general practice clinics will benefit from insights for improving refugee identification, health assessment, interpreter use and referral. Potential solutions can be adapted to local contexts to address a local health system’s priority gaps and will ultimately assist the Australian health system to integrate care and reduce the burden on refugee focused health services to meet the needs of this vulnerable population. Additional benefits are likely to flow from inter-sectoral partnerships between academics, Refugee Focused Health Services, mainstream general practice clinics, settlement services, state governments and primary health care organisations.</p>
