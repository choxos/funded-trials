                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Neck pain is prevalent among office workers. This study evaluated the impact of an ergonomic and exercise training (EET) intervention and an ergonomic and health promotion (EHP) intervention on neck pain intensity among the All Workers and a subgroup of Neck Pain cases at baseline.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A 12-month cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 14 public and private organisations. Office workers aged ≥18 years working ≥30 h per week (<italic>n</italic> = 740) received an individualised workstation ergonomic intervention, followed by 1:1 allocation to the EET group (neck-specific exercise training), or the EHP group (health promotion) for 12 weeks. Neck pain intensity (scale: 0–9) was recorded at baseline, 12 weeks, and 12 months. Participants with data at these three time points were included for analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 367). Intervention group differences were analysed using generalized estimating equation models on an intention-to-treat basis and adjusted for potential confounders. Subgroup analysis was performed on neck cases reporting pain ≥3 at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 96).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The EET group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in neck pain intensity at 12 weeks compared to the EHP group for All Workers (EET: β = − 0.53 points 95% CI: − 0.84– − 0.22 [36%] and EHP: β = − 0.17 points 95% CI: − 0.47–0.13 [10.5%], <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.02) and the Neck Cases (EET: β = − 2.32 points 95% CI: − 3.09– − 1.56 [53%] and EHP: β = − 1.75 points 95% CI: − 2.35– − 1.16 [36%], <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Reductions in pain intensity were not maintained at 12 months with no between-group differences observed in All Workers (EET: β = − 0.18, 95% CI: − 0.53–0.16 and EHP: β = − 0.14 points 95% CI: − 0.49–0.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.53) or Neck Cases, although in both groups an overall reduction was found (EET: β = − 1.61 points 95% CI: − 2.36– − 0.89 and EHP: β = − 1.9 points 95% CI: − 2.59– − 1.20, <italic>p</italic> = 0.26).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">EET was more effective than EHP in reducing neck pain intensity in All Workers and Neck Cases immediately following the intervention period (12 weeks) but not at 12 months, with changes at 12 weeks reaching clinically meaningful thresholds for the Neck Cases. Findings suggest the need for continuation of exercise to maintain benefits in the longer term.</p>

              <p id="Par9">Office workers have among the highest prevalence of neck symptoms (18–63% per year) compared to other occupations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and other bodily locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Due to the amount of time an individual spends at the workplace and because of the strong link between health and productivity, the workplace is becoming the arena for many health initiatives. The most common workplace-based interventions tested to address neck problems in office workers tend to include either exercise or ergonomic changes. A recent review of workplace-based interventions found moderate quality evidence that strengthening exercises were effective in reducing neck pain in office workers who were symptomatic, but did not demonstrate effectiveness in a population of office workers that included those with and without symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similarly, van Eerd et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] found strong evidence for resistance training programs recommending these be implemented to help prevent and manage work-related upper extremity musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Ergonomic interventions are endorsed by local health and safety regulatory authorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but the scientific evidence of these interventions for the prevention and management of neck symptoms is mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] found limited evidence that multiple workstation adjustments may be effective in office workers who are symptomatic with conflicting and low quality evidence for a general population of office workers. In contrast, van Eerd et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] found moderate evidence of a positive effect for forearm supports and mixed evidence that ergonomic training plus workstation adjustments were effective. The discrepancies could be due to the difference in outcomes (neck vs upper extremity pain), and occupational groups included (office workers vs all occupations). Nevertheless, it is possible that a combination of the most common interventions, exercise and ergonomic, will yield benefits for the office worker with neck pain than either alone. This was the case in a recent six month randomized trial which found the combination of exercise and ergonomic modifications and exercise alone were effective in reducing the severity of neck pain in office workers symptomatic at baseline compared with a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indeed, the recommendation from that study was that therapists should include exercise training to achieve long-term benefits rather than rely solely on ergonomic modifications.</p>
              <p id="Par11">There has recently been a move in comparative effectiveness research to identify the most efficient and effective public health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], providing better evidence to guide decision makers (in this case employers) in improving health outcomes for all employees. Comparing interventions in the general office worker population (including symptomatic and asymptomatic office workers) is informative to employers to determine if they are equitable and financially efficient from preventative and symptom management perspectives. There is current evidence supporting workplace-based strengthening exercise interventions in symptomatic office workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] with emerging evidence for these interventions among the general office worker population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a limited number of trials evaluating the effects of a combined strengthening exercise and ergonomic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This study aimed to merge the interventions with the strongest evidence amongst office workers for addressing neck pain (exercise) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with current health and safety regulations (ergonomic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate (after 12 weeks intervention) and long-term (12-month follow-up) effects of a combined exercise and ergonomic intervention on neck pain in a general office worker population, and among office workers symptomatic at baseline. The novelty of this approach is the combination of common interventions delivered to all workers with the focus of this paper on the secondary prevention of neck pain. To be consistent with the trend for comparative effectiveness research to inform public health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], a general health promotion intervention was combined with the ergonomic intervention as the comparator. This comparator intervention could serve as a more scalable alternative, requiring less specialised services to deliver than neck-specific exercises, and if found effective in preventing and managing neck pain, could benefit all employees (not only those with neck pain). We hypothesized that the combined ergonomics and exercise training (EET) would be more effective than the combined ergonomics and health promotion (EHP) in reducing neck pain intensity in a general office worker population, as well as in those with neck pain.</p>

The optimal cluster size was pre-determined (5–8) to ensure adequate supervision and facilitation for the EET. In open planned offices, larger or smaller clusters were formed to reduce the risk of contamination. Clustering ensures homogeneity within- and heterogeneity between-clusters. An even number of clusters were created within each organisation. A statistician blinded to the identity of the individuals assigned the clusters by simple random allocation using computer-generated block randomisation (in blocks of four) to either the EET or the EHP group. All participants within the same cluster were randomized to the same intervention and notified of their assignment by the project manager after completion of baseline assessments but before interventions commenced. This was repeated at each organisation.</p>

An observational checklist (37 items) of the physical workstation across five domains (Chair - 7 items; Desk - 9 items; Keyboard and Mouse – 8 items; Screen - 5 items; Telephone - 3 items; Environment – 5 items) was used with moderate-to-good inter-rater reliability demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Post-assessment, individual adjustments to the chair (height and backrest), monitor (e.g. reposition of monitor/s) and other workstation items were provided as needed.

The exercises included postural facilitation, upper neck flexion exercise (warm up for each session), and five main progressive resisted exercises performed in cycles of three exercises/session (i.e. neck flexion, neck extension, reverse flies, front and side arm raise to 90<sup>0</sup>). Training load for each individual was based on their one-repetition maximum (1-RM) recorded prior to commencement for the shoulder and neck exercises. This load was regularly re-evaluated by the intervention physiotherapist to ensure appropriate exercise progression. Participants were supervised by the physiotherapist for two sessions in the first week and, subsequently, one session each week to enhance intervention adherence and ensure efficient, correct, and safe execution of exercises. Paper diaries were issued to all participants with the exercises described in detail. These diaries served to remind participants of the exercises to be performed at each session and to record exercise intensity. On completion, participants were asked to continue the exercise training (explained in the diary) and were provided with resistance bands, a proposed fortnightly training schedule and instructions on how to perform exercises at home.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par35">The findings partly support our hypothesis that a combined ergonomics and exercise training intervention may be more effective than a combined ergonomics and health promotion intervention in reducing neck pain intensity in All Workers as well as the subgroup of Neck Cases. The EET group had experienced significantly greater reductions in neck pain compared to the EHP group by the end of the intervention period (12 weeks) in both the All Workers and Neck Cases confirming the findings of previous systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However these between-group differences were absent at 12-month follow-up. As evident in Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, this loss of between-group differences at 12 months reflects a progressive return of pain intensity in the EET group. Interestingly, this is matched by very poor adherence at 12 months with &lt; 21% of the EET group (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) reporting the continuation of regular exercise. It is possible that higher participation rates would have yielded greater reductions in neck pain with evidence of a dose-response relationship with participation in exercise training for office workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The findings in a previous study evaluating resistance exercise of the neck/shoulder region demonstrated sustained improvements in neck/shoulder pain when exercise training was maintained over an intervention period of 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Such findings support the notion that the benefits of exercise may be greatest when exercise is continued in the long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], particularly given the recurrent nature of neck pain and its disability burden to society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Previous studies support the importance of management support and organisational commitment to ensure the success of such interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, in a process evaluation of this trial, strong organisational commitment did not translate to implementation effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, this study showed that strength training could be successfully implemented during working hours but that strategies are needed to support adherence in the long-term.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Of relevance to industry, reductions in neck pain intensity in the subgroup of Neck Cases were clinically meaningful after 12 weeks (EET 2.39, 54%; EHP 1.82, 38%, both &gt; 30% reduction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These reductions were of greater magnitude to those reported in previous studies (0.7–1.6 point pain reduction on a 0–9 scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]) using similar interventions and participants with similar (or lower) levels of neck pain at baseline (3.3–4.8 points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Reduction in neck pain intensity in All Workers in both intervention groups in our study (0.14–0.45, [8.7–30.6%] at 12 weeks; 0.05–0.12 [3–8%] at 12 months) was also similar to previous studies including all office workers (0.4 and 0.6 points reduction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, the advantage of our intervention is that these benefits were gained after a 12 week rather than 20-week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] or a one-year intervention of similar exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Notably, it was challenging to achieve large amplitude reductions in neck pain intensity in All Workers who reported low mean pain intensity at baseline (EET 1.47, EHP 1.61) reflecting the dilution effect of combining workers with and without neck pain at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Importantly, the magnitude of effect on neck pain intensity observed in exercise intervention participants at 12 months in the present and previous studies involving All Workers is similar to that achieved by our EHP intervention group a potentially more scalable and financially efficient alternative for employers wishing to provide a service suitable for all workers. However, the potential gains in health must be considered with the evidence that the EET intervention delivered productivity benefits for All Workers in the long-term compared to the EHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">The ergonomic component included modifications to items within the workstation and postural advice. It is possible that this component may have contributed to the significant, but similar improvements in neck pain experienced by both intervention groups at 12-month follow-up. Similar results were reported for the combination of ergonomic modification and stretching exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and ergonomic training and neck motor control training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] in symptomatic office workers. The lack of a third intervention group comprising only the workstation ergonomic component limited the ability to exclude potential individual or work-related reasons associated with changes in pain in both groups. However, an ergonomic intervention alone has not been shown to be as effective as the combination with exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is possible that more regular follow-up was needed to achieve further improvements or the addition of ergonomic educational training. Pillastrini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] demonstrated that a personalized comprehensive ergonomic intervention with twice monthly follow-up for five months plus training reduced the proportion of office workers with neck pain compared with an ergonomic brochure alone. However, such an intensive intervention may not be financially viable in the long-term.</p>
              <p id="Par38">While we hypothesized that the EET training would be more effective than the EHP, it is possible that some features of the latter intervention contributed to similar reductions in neck pain at 12 months. For example, the health promotion sessions were designed to vary week-to-week and be engaging and social, while EET participants received the same exercise protocol each week, with only the exercise intensity varying on a weekly basis. The health promotion sessions could have motivated individuals to improve lifestyle behaviours and mental health, thus contributing to improvements in self-reported pain. It is also possible that an hour at a time away from work provided additional benefit to mental and physical stressors, which have been associated with neck symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Potentially, the inclusion of the health promotion intervention offers advantages to industry as a realistic alternative to exercise. Similar studies testing exercise interventions have included options of no intervention or general health counselling risking poor adherence. The adherence to the health promotion intervention in our study was 62% at 12 months for All Workers while it was only 9% for those receiving health counselling in a similar study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Further exploration of the potential mechanisms underlying the observed improvements in neck pain and our previously reported productivity benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] across both groups is warranted.</p>

                <title>Study strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par39">Important strengths of this study were the clustered design using ITT analyses, and 12-month follow-up. The sample size permitted separate analyses of All Workers and Neck Cases, allowing generalizability of results to both office worker populations. Furthermore, this study tested two multi-component interventions, which are considered more likely to demonstrate benefit than single-component interventions.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Limitations include the low baseline severity of neck pain in the All Workers group, but providing access to health interventions to all employees is important from a primary prevention perspective. Interpretation of results is restricted by the missing data due to low compliance at follow-up. Whilst not desirable, the 12-month data loss is not unusual compared to other lifestyle workplace-based trials (approximately 45–65%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In this trial, several attempts were made to contact participants who did not provide data at 12-week and 12-month follow-up. The trial’s conservative definition of neck cases (pain intensity ≥3 last seven days) and the recruitment of participants who were unaware of the trial intention may have resulted in the recruitment of lower than expected numbers of neck cases. Organisations were asked not to undertake other workplace-based interventions during the study period, but this was only assessed retrospectively.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par41">A combined exercise and ergonomic intervention was more effective than a combined health promotion and ergonomic intervention in reducing neck pain intensity in All Workers and those with neck pain immediately following the intervention period. However, intervention differences were not maintained at 12-month follow-up suggesting the potential need for exercise interventions to be long-term or continuous to maintain benefits. This study provides evidence for the benefit for the health promotion intervention to be a scalable and financially efficient program to address neck pain in all office workers although productivity gains may be greater for those participating in exercise interventions. Strategies to promote adherence to exercise in the long-term may deliver both health and productivity benefits.</p>
