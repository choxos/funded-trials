                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is prevalent and debilitating. This study investigated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for severe fatigue following COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A multicenter, 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands with patients being severely fatigued 3â12 months following COVID-19. Patients (N = 114) were randomly assigned (1:1) to CBT or care as usual (CAU). CBT, targeting perpetuating factors of fatigue, was provided for 17 weeks. The primary outcome was the overall mean difference between CBT and CAU on the fatigue severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength, directly post-CBT or CAU (T1), and after 6 months (T2). Secondary outcomes were differences in proportions of patients meeting criteria for severe and/or chronic fatigue, differences in physical and social functioning, somatic symptoms, and problems concentrating between CBT and CAU.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Patients were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred. Patients who received CBT were significantly less severely fatigued across follow-up assessments than patients receiving CAU (â8.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, â11.9 to â5.8]); <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001), representing a medium Cohen's d effect size (0.69). The between-group difference in fatigue severity was present at T1 (â9.3 [95% CI, â13.3 to â5.3]) and T2 (â8.4 [95% CI, â13.1 to â3.7]). All secondary outcomes favored CBT. Eight adverse events were recorded during CBT, and 20 during CAU. No serious adverse events were recorded.</p>

                  <p>Among patients, who were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred, CBT was effective in reducing fatigue. The positive effect was sustained at 6-month follow-up.</p>

          <body>
            <p>As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic enters its fourth year, increasing attention is directed toward its long-term sequelae, referred to as long COVID or PASC (postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) [<xref rid="ciad257-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Fatigue is among the most prevalent symptoms of PASC and is common among patients being previously hospitalized and those not being hospitalized [<xref rid="ciad257-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ciad257-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The fatigue is often severe [<xref rid="ciad257-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and still reported by some up to 2 years after the acute phase of COVID-19, indicating a chronic course in a subset of patients [<xref rid="ciad257-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As severe fatigue following COVID-19 and related disability affects millions worldwide, evidence-based interventions are urgently needed.</p>
            <p>Persistent, severe fatigue is a common symptom following infectious diseases [<xref rid="ciad257-B6" ref-type="bibr">6â8</xref>]. Cognitive-behavioral variables, such as a disrupted sleepâwake pattern, low or unevenly distributed level of activity, or unhelpful fatigue-related beliefs, are associated with the persistence of fatigue across several long-term medical conditions [<xref rid="ciad257-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting these perpetuating cognitive-behavioral factors has been shown to be effective in reducing severe fatigue in patients with postinfectious fatigue and in long-term medical conditions directly posttreatment [<xref rid="ciad257-B10" ref-type="bibr">10â12</xref>]. Furthermore, CBT targeting fatigue in other conditions not only led to a reduction of fatigue but also improved physical and/or social functioning [<xref rid="ciad257-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Long-term outcomes of CBT for severe fatigue have been mixed: some studies have shown sustainment of treatment effects in the majority of patients while others have shown a substantial relapse [<xref rid="ciad257-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ciad257-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Until now, the efficacy of CBT has not been investigated in patients suffering from postâCOVID-19 fatigue. We hypothesized that addressing cognitive-behavioral factors that can maintain fatigue may lead to a reduction of severe fatigue following COVID-19.</p>
            <p>The ReCOVer study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to investigate the efficacy of CBT directly posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up for severe fatigue following COVID-19, as compared to care as usual (CAU), in patients being severely fatigued 3â12 months postâCOVID-19.</p>

                <p>Patients were recruited by physicians of 6 participating hospitals in the Netherlands, by healthcare providers, and by self-referral. For clinician-referred patients, the physician or research nurse checked the medical eligibility criteria. The eligibility of self-referred patients was checked by contacting their general practitioner (GP) and requesting a copy of the positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. In case of doubt, the self-referred patient was seen by a physician of a participating hospital. After obtaining written informed consent, additional screening questionnaires were administered.

Due to the nature of the intervention, research assistants, participants, and therapists were not blinded to randomization outcome. Data were analyzed by 2 statisticians independently (P. N., I. C.) using a file blinded for intervention allocation.</p>

                <p>Eligible participants completed the baseline questionnaires (T0) before they were randomized. For practical reasons, CBT with a planned duration of 17 weeks started approximately 2 weeks after randomization. After the CBT or CAU period, participants completed the T1 questionnaires (19 weeks postrandomization). Six months after T1, the follow-up assessment (T2) was completed. Questionnaires were completed online.</p>
                <p>CBT for postâCOVID-19 fatigue, called Fit after COVID, was developed by adapting existing CBT protocols for severe fatigue in long-term medical conditions [<xref rid="ciad257-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ciad257-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is based on a cognitive-behavioral model of fatigue, which assumes that a disease (in this case, COVID-19) triggers fatigue while cognitive-behavioral variables can perpetuate it [<xref rid="ciad257-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ciad257-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The 7 perpetuating factors addressed are (1) a disrupted sleepâwake pattern; (2) unhelpful beliefs about fatigue; (3) a low or unevenly distributed activity level; (4) perceived low social support; (5) problems with psychological processing of COVID-19; (6) fears and worries regarding COVID-19; and (7) poor coping with pain. Fit after COVID is a blended intervention. For details on the content of the modules and tailoring of the intervention, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. During development of the intervention, 3 patients suffering from fatigue following COVID-19 and recruited by the patient organization Lung Foundation Netherlands read the treatment protocol and tested the online modules. They evaluated the content and usability of the internet intervention positively.</p>
                <p>Participants could access treatment modules on an online platform. During the COVID-19 pandemic, using an internet intervention ensured therapy continuation despite preventive public health measures, while face-to-face contact was also available for those patients who were unable or unwilling to use the internet-based format. All therapists were psychologists trained in the treatment protocol during a 4-day course and supervised biweekly by experienced clinical psychologists (H. K., T. A. K.) to ensure treatment integrity.</p>
                <p>Participants randomized to CAU had no access to Fit after COVID but were not restricted in seeking care including psychological interventions for fatigue or other symptoms. There were no restrictions on care received by participants in the CBT group during CBT, other than multidisciplinary rehabilitation.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>To investigate the effect of CBT directly posttreatment and at a follow-up 6 months later, the primary outcome was the difference in fatigue severity across follow-up assessments (T1 and T2) between the CBT group and the CAU group. Fatigue severity was assessed with the fatigue subscale of the 20-item Checklist Individual Strength (CIS-fatigue) [<xref rid="ciad257-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The CIS-fatigue subscale consists of 8 items with a total score ranging from 8 to 56, with higher scores indicating more severe fatigue. The validated cutoff score for severe fatigue is â¥35 [<xref rid="ciad257-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>As secondary outcomes, we evaluated the difference in the proportion of patients between the CBT and the CAU group at T1 and T2 separately who were (1) no longer severely fatigued, operationalized as scoring &lt;35 on the CIS-fatigue [<xref rid="ciad257-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; (2) no longer severely fatigued and reporting a reliable change in fatigue (ie, reliable change index [RCI] of &gt;1.96 [<xref rid="ciad257-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]); and (3) not chronically fatigued, with chronic fatigue operationalized as having severe fatigue with a self-reported duration of â¥6 months. In addition, we compared the CBT and CAU group across T1 and T2 regarding (4) physical functioning assessed with the physical functioning subscale of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) [<xref rid="ciad257-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; (5) social functioning, operationalized as the score on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) [<xref rid="ciad257-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; (6) somatic symptom severity, assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) [<xref rid="ciad257-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; and (7) problems concentrating, assessed with the concentration problems subscale of the CIS.</p>
                <p>Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) were recorded based on participantsâ self-report at T1 and observations by the study staff and therapists. Two physicians (C. B. R., S. P. K.), blinded to intervention allocation, independently rated the likelihood that the events could be attributed to CBT and discussed discrepancies until consensus was reached.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The sample size calculation was based on testing the primary hypothesis that CBT leads to a significantly lower mean CIS-fatigue score across T1 and T2 as compared to CAU. A difference of 6 points on the CIS-fatigue score is considered clinically relevant [<xref rid="ciad257-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on previous research, we assume a common standard deviation (SD) of 12 and correlation coefficients of 0.4 among CIS-fatigue scores assessed at T1 and T2. With a sample size of 45 in each group, a 2-sided test for the time-averaged difference between 2 means in a repeated-measures design with a .05 significance level has 80% power to detect a difference in means of 6 in a design with 2 repeated measurements. Assuming a dropout of 20%, 114 participants were randomized, 57 to each condition.</p>
                <p>Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed according to intention-to-treat. The primary outcome was analyzed using a mixed linear model, which included CIS-fatigue as the dependent variable; condition (CBT vs CAU), time (T1, T2), and condition-by-time interaction as fixed effects; and the CIS-fatigue score at baseline (T0) as covariate and in which the repeated measurements were nested within participants. Only when the main effect of condition was statistically significant, then the statistical significance of the between-group differences at T1 and T2 was separately interpreted. Cohen's d effect size was calculated by dividing the parameter estimate for the mean difference in CIS-fatigue scores between conditions from the mixed linear model by the pooled standard deviation at T2 of both conditions combined. Effect size magnitudes were interpreted as small (0.2â0.5), medium (0.5â0.8), and large (â¥0.8) [<xref rid="ciad257-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
                <p>Dichotomous secondary outcomes were compared at T1 and T2 separately by calculating relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of not being severely and/or chronically fatigued in the CBT versus the CAU group. The RCI was calculated as RCI = (x<sub>2</sub> â x<sub>1</sub>)/S<sub>diff</sub>, where x<sub>1</sub> is the CIS-fatigue score at baseline, x<sub>2</sub> the CIS-fatigue score at follow-up, and S<sub>diff</sub> the standard error of the difference. S<sub>diff</sub> was calculated with S<sub>diff</sub> = â2(S<sub>E</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, where S<sub>E</sub> is the standard error of the measurement. To calculate S<sub>E</sub>, the average Cronbach Î± of the CIS-fatigue score from previous studies (0.89) was used [<xref rid="ciad257-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ciad257-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The continuous secondary outcomes were analyzed using mixed linear models as described for the primary outcome.</p>
                <p>To explore the robustness of our findings from the primary analysis, 4 sensitivity analyses were conducted. The first comprised per protocol analyses with 2 operationalizations of treatment completion: (1) participants who have filled out the treatment goals and opened the 5 standard modules of the intervention (portal log data) and (2) participants who attended at least 3 sessions (therapist registration) face-to-face or via video consult. Second, the extent to which our results would change if based on a single time point was explored. Therefore a separate 1-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted with group allocation as a fixed factor, baseline CIS-fatigue score as covariate, and the CIS-fatigue score at either T1 or T2 as dependent variable. For each time point, Cohen's d was calculated. Third, we explored the extent to which dyspnea at T0, disease severity, operationalized as previously being hospitalized for COVID-19, time since diagnosis of COVID-19, age, and sex have an impact on the primary outcome, and whether this impact differs between CBT and CAU. Fourth, ANCOVAs of fatigue severity at T1 and T2 separately were reanalyzed replacing missing values with multiple imputation.</p>
                <p>The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 28. Cohen's d was calculated using R version 4.0.3.</p>

              <p>From 12 November 2020 to 21 September 2021, 721 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of this group, 114 patients, the target sample size, were randomized to CBT (n = 57) or to CAU (n = 57). The majority of the patients were self-referred (75/114 [66%]) and did not require hospitalization during their initial COVID-19 (101/114 [89%]). All patients but 1 were infected before being vaccinated. See <xref rid="ciad257-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> for the flowchart and <xref rid="ciad257-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for the baseline characteristics. At T1, data were missing for &lt;1% of patients (1/114, CBT) for the primary outcome and &lt;4% of patients (2 CBT, 2 CAU [4/114]) for secondary outcomes. At T2, data were missing for &lt;6% of patients (3 CBT, 4 CAU [7/114]) for the primary outcome and &lt;8% of patients (3 CBT, 6 CAU [9/114]) for secondary outcomes.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This RCT showed that patients who reported severe fatigue 3â12 months following COVID-19 were significantly less severely fatigued after CBT than after CAU. Our findings are in line with previous studies investigating the efficacy of CBT for severe fatigue in other patient groups [<xref rid="ciad257-B10" ref-type="bibr">10â12</xref>]. Moreover, positive effects of CBT were sustained for 6 months after the intervention. This is an important finding given mixed long-term outcomes of CBT in other studies [<xref rid="ciad257-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ciad257-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, patients randomized to CBT were also less often severely and chronically fatigued and reported fewer concentration problems, less severe somatic symptoms, and improved physical and social functioning across follow-up assessments.</p>
              <p>This study has several strengths. It was a multicenter RCT and entailed a follow-up assessment 6 months after CBT or CAU. The high number of self-referrals and low attrition rate suggest that CBT is an acceptable and feasible intervention for at least a group of postâCOVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our preliminary data on AEs and the absence of deterioration of fatigue in the CBT group indicate that CBT for severe postâCOVID-19 is safe. The intervention, due to its online format, could be relatively swiftly implemented and reach a wide patient group.</p>
              <p>This study has limitations. As in all studies testing the efficacy of behavioral/psychotherapeutic interventions, blinding is not possible because both patient and therapist are aware of the allocated treatment. Also, this is the first study testing the efficacy of CBT for postâCOVID fatigue. Replication in other settings or regions is warranted to determine the generalizability of our results. Furthermore, the majority of included patients did not require hospitalization for COVID-19. Our results might therefore not generalize to patients with hospital or ICU admission. As there is no reliable biomarker of severe fatigue, we used a patient-reported outcome to assess fatigue severity.</p>
              <p>Despite efforts to recruit patients consecutively, the majority of included patients were self-referred. This might have caused a selection biasâfor example, this group may have been more motivated to undertake a behavioral intervention than patients routinely visiting an outpatient clinic [<xref rid="ciad257-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, self-referrals may better represent the target patient group for implementation of CBT in clinical practice.</p>
              <p>A further limitation of this study is the use of CAU as comparison condition. A placebo condition matched with respect to the attention given and offering of a treatment rationale would have been preferable to rule out that the effects of CBT were (partly) nonspecific. However, most participants in the CAU group received care, including exercise, which has been found to be effective for post-COVID-19 sequelae [<xref rid="ciad257-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A substantial number of patients in the CAU condition might therefore have received an intervention with a comparable amount of attention provided and which also offered a credible treatment rationale, but without the specific elements of CBT.</p>
              <p>Finally, a limitation of our study is that a formal treatment integrity check was not performed. However, all therapists were trained and supervised to assure protocol adherence. Furthermore, the delivery of treatment modules was registered.</p>
              <p>Of note, applying a cognitive-behavioral approach to the treatment of post-COVID-19 fatigue neither implies that its cause is psychological, nor does it negate a possible somatic cause. We encourage research into its underlying (neuro)biological mechanisms. Relatedly, while the majority of patients were no longer severely fatigued following CBT, a substantial group remained severely fatigued. Research into other treatment approaches is warranted.</p>
              <p>This study provides first evidence for the positive effect of CBT in patients with severe postâCOVID-19 fatigue.</p>
