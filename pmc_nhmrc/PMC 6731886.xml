                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>School canteens are the most frequently accessed take-away food outlet by Australian children. The rapid development of online lunch ordering systems for school canteens presents new opportunities to deliver novel public health nutrition interventions to school-aged children. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a behavioural intervention in reducing the energy, saturated fat, sugar and sodium content of online canteen lunch orders for primary school children.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The study will employ a cluster randomised controlled trial design. Twenty-six primary schools in New South Wales, Australia, that have an existing online canteen ordering system will be randomised to receive either a multi-strategy behavioural intervention or a control (the standard online canteen ordering system). The intervention will be integrated into the existing online canteen system and will seek to encourage the purchase of healthier food and drinks for school lunch orders (ie, items lower in energy, saturated fat, sugar and sodium). The behavioural intervention will use evidence-based choice architecture strategies to redesign the online menu and ordering system including: menu labelling, placement, prompting and provision of feedback and incentives. The primary trial outcomes will be the mean energy (kilojoules), saturated fat (grams), sugar (grams) and sodium (milligrams) content of lunch orders placed via the online system, and will be assessed 12 months after baseline data collection.</p>

                  <p>The study was approved by the ethics committees of the University of Newcastle (H-2017–0402) and the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities (SERAP 2018065), and the Catholic Education Office Dioceses of Sydney, Parramatta, Lismore, Maitland-Newcastle, Bathurst, Canberra-Goulburn, Wollongong, Wagga Wagga and Wilcannia-Forbes. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, reports, presentations at relevant national and international conferences and via briefings to key stakeholders. Results will be used to inform future implementation of public health nutrition interventions through school canteens, and may be transferable to other food settings or online systems for ordering food.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dietary risk factors are a leading cause of death and disability internationally.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Given dietary behaviours in childhood track into adulthood and are predictive of future chronic disease,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> improving child nutrition is a health priority in Australia and internationally.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Schools provide an important setting for promoting healthy food consumption to children as they provide centralised access to almost every Australian child for prolonged periods, with children consuming almost 40% of their recommended energy intake while at school.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Schools also represent a significant food provider. In New South Wales (NSW), 95% of primary-aged children attend a school with a canteen<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and 55% of students order their lunch from the canteen at least weekly, compared with 23% of students that eat a meal or snack from a fast-food outlet each week.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The most frequently purchased menu items from canteens are often high in fat, sugar and salt<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> with canteen purchases contributing an additional 200 kJ to energy consumed at school, compared with foods brought from home.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
              <p>While previous attempts to improve the school food environment have focused on changing the relative availability of unhealthy foods for sale at school,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–12</xref> modifying other drivers of consumer behaviour represents an additional opportunity to improve children’s diet. For example, previous research has demonstrated that point-of-purchase interventions that involve nutrition labelling,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> manipulating the placement of menu items<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and the provision of purchasing prompts,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> nutritional feedback<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and incentives<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> can influence the purchase of foods and drinks among children and adults. Despite the potential of behavioural strategies to encourage healthy purchasing, national and international studies of (non-online) canteens and cafeterias indicate that such strategies are underutilised in schools. The US School Health Policies and Practices Study of 544 elementary schools found few school cafeterias used strategies such as provision of nutritional feedback (60%) or item placement (10%–26%) or incentives (16%–17%) to encourage healthy purchasing.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, an Australian study of 203 primary schools found that only 43% reported labelling their canteen menus to identify healthy options.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p>
              <p>Canteen online ordering systems allow users to view, select and purchase food and drink menu items online, and represent a new approach for children to access food at school. They are becoming increasingly popular in Australia,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with the leading supplier servicing over 1200 schools nationally and processing over 13 million lunch orders per year.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These systems represent an attractive opportunity to apply a range of behavioural strategies that can reach large numbers of individuals at relatively low cost.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Strategies including menu or product labelling, product placement and the provision of prompts and incentives are routinely used to influence purchase decisions by food retailers online.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Furthermore, given these systems are centrally administrated, interventions delivered via these means may be more resistant to the transient nature of local canteen staffing, a common barrier to sustainable implementation of nutrition guidelines and interventions in this setting.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p>
              <p>We recently conducted a pilot trial that evaluated the use of strategies including traffic light menu-labelling, prominent placement of healthy menu items, provision of prompts to select healthy menu items, and reduced accessibility of less healthy items<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> integrated into an online school canteen ordering system. The trial was undertaken in ten NSW primary schools over a 2 month intervention period and found that, compared with controls, intervention lunch orders were significantly lower in energy (−567 kJ), saturated fat (−2.37 g) and sodium (−228 mg) (all p&lt;0.001).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Given these promising findings, a larger trial is proposed and described in this protocol, which tests a greater range of intervention strategies, using a larger study sample and longer period of follow-up.</p>

                <p>The study will be conducted in government, independent and catholic schools in NSW, Australia, and will use a cluster randomised controlled trial design. Schools that currently use the ‘Flexischools’ online canteen ordering system will be randomised to either an intervention or usual practice control group. Intervention effectiveness will be assessed by comparing between-group differences at follow-up in the mean (1) energy (kilojoules), (2) saturated fat (grams), (3) sugar (grams) and (4) sodium (milligrams) contained in students’ online lunch orders, based on purchasing data that is automatically collected by the online canteen system. Both baseline and follow-up assessment periods will be conducted over one school term, of approximately 10 weeks’ duration, one calendar year apart.</p>

                  <p>All NSW primary schools currently using the ‘Flexischools’ online canteen system<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> will serve as the sampling frame (n=481). A list of all such schools has been supplied by the provider of the online canteen ordering system (here-after referred to as the ‘provider’) servicing over 1200 schools across Australia.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> One member of the research team will act as the recruitment coordinator and will manage recruitment and consent into the trial. Study information and consent forms will be mailed to the school principal and canteen manager at all potentially eligible schools from the sampling frame. Approximately 1–2 weeks later, the recruitment coordinator will make a follow-up phone call to speak with the school principal and/or canteen manager about the research and confirm school eligibility using procedures previously undertaken by the research team. Principal consent will be required to enable school participation in the trial and to enable the researchers to access the school’s canteen purchasing data from the provider. Principals will retain the right to discontinue their participation in the study and withdraw the school from the trial at any point.</p>

                  <p>Given canteen guidelines differ from state to state and between primary and secondary schools, only NSW primary schools (serviced by the provider) will be included in the study.</p>
                  <p>Schools will be approached via mail and telephone to participate. Schools that can be identified (ie, from a published list or where reliable data can be sourced about their operation) as having an externally licensed commercial canteen operator will be removed from the sample due to the potential for contamination between schools. Schools that enrol both primary (kindergarten to grade 6) and secondary (grade 7 to 12) school students will only be included where there is a separate canteen menu for primary school students, due to differences in the NSW canteen guidelines for primary versus secondary schools.</p>

                  <p>Users of the online canteen system could be students or parents/carers who place orders on behalf of their children. Schools that use an online canteen system can also choose to retain the traditional method for placing lunch orders (ie, writing the lunch order on a paper bag and submitting directly to the canteen) in addition to offering online ordering. To submit an online order, users access the provider’s website from their mobile device or computer. They then select the day and meal for which they want to place an order (eg, Tuesday, lunchtime), and they are then shown the full list of food and drink menu items that are available for that meal. To order, users click on menu items and then pay via a credit or debit card or PayPal. Data supplied from the provider suggests that on average, 30%–40% of students in schools they service have an account set up to enable online canteen ordering and have ordered within the last 30 days.</p>

                  <p>Students who have an online lunch order submitted during the baseline data collection period are eligible for inclusion in the trial. As the follow-up data collection period occurs in the subsequent school year, only students in kindergarten to grade 5 (ages 5–11) will be included at baseline, in order to ensure they are available for follow-up. Given not all schools offer online ordering for recess foods, recess purchases will not be included in the analysis. Furthermore, only lunch orders submitted via mobile devices (approximately 70%) will be included in the analysis as the desktop version is due to be phased out by the provider. As such orders submitted via the desktop website, or orders submitted at the canteen will not be included in the analysis.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Following school recruitment and baseline data collection, schools will be randomised by an independent statistician using a randomised number function in Microsoft Excel in a 1:1 ratio to either an intervention or control group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Block randomisation will be employed to ensure group allocation is approximately equal, with block size randomly varying between 2 and 4. Given evidence that there are differences in the implementation of canteen guidelines between more and less advantaged areas and between government and non-government school sectors,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the randomisation procedure will be stratified by the socioeconomic status of a school locality (based on postcode and dichotomised into most vs least advantaged), and by school sector (government vs catholic vs independent). Following random allocation to either intervention or control group, the online strategies will be applied to the canteen menus of each intervention school by accessing the canteen manager portal within the online canteen system. A research assistant will perform a quality check on the live website to ensure all strategies have been correctly applied. Due to the difficulty in blinding users to the changes introduced as part of the intervention, the study will be conducted as an open trial. However, the dietitians conducting the menu assessment will be blind to group allocation via the removal of all identifiable information from menus prior to assessment.</p>

The report will contain a copy of their online menu with all items classified as ‘Everyday’, ‘Occasional’ or ‘Should Not Be Sold’ and graphical feedback comparing their menu to the recommendations of the criteria (ie, ‘Everyday’ foods should compromise at least 75% of the menu, and ‘Should Not Be Sold’ foods should be removed from the menu). The report will also contain suggestions for how to better align their menu with the Food and Drink Criteria, ways of increasing the proportion of ‘Everyday’ items and suggestions for alternatives to menu items classified as ‘Should Not Be Sold’.</p>

Food and drink items will be categorised as either (a) ‘Everyday’, (b) ‘Occasional’ or (c) ‘Caution—consider switching’ and be labelled with green dots, grey dots or red exclamation marks, respectively. The terminology of the Healthy School Canteen Strategy has been designed for use by canteen managers, rather than parents and/or children. As such, it was determined through expert consultation that ‘Should Not Be Sold’ was an inappropriate and potentially confusing label for consumers, and ‘Caution—consider switching’ provided a behavioural action which would be more appropriate. Previous research has found simplified traffic light labelling similar to the one used in this study is highly likely to be noticed by parents when making purchase decisions for their children, with 96% of parents assigned to a traffic-light labelling menu condition reporting noticing the labelling system.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>

                  <p>Trained research assistants with Nutrition and Dietetics qualifications will conduct a menu assessment for each participating school and will classify each menu item as ‘Everyday’, ‘Occasional’ or ‘Caution’ and will record the nutrition information for each product. Where additional information is required beyond what is listed on the canteen menu, the school canteen manager will be phoned to collect brand and product name and serve size or recipe, including yield. For commercial (eg, packaged products) and assembled (eg, sandwiches) items research assistants will use a database of commonly stocked canteen products to obtain the nutrition information panel. The canteen product database was established in 2015 and was generated based on data collected from 38 schools and includes over 2000 commonly stocked canteen items. It was used as the basis for nutritional information classification in the pilot study<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and has been regularly updated. The canteen product database contains the nutrient panel information for all items which includes the brand, serve size and energy, saturated fat, sugar and sodium content per serve and per 100 g. If the item is not listed in the canteen product database, two additional sources will be searched: (1) The FoodFinder Database—a list of common canteen foods classified under the NSW Healthy Canteen Strategy supplied by the NSW Ministry of Health,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and (2) The FoodSwitch website—a list of supermarket products maintained by the George Institute for Global Health.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> If the item cannot be located in any database, the research assistant will search for the nutrient panel online, and if it cannot be located, a ‘generic’ nutrient profile will be assigned using a commercial equivalent found in the canteen product database. For canteen-made items (eg, muffins) the recipe will be entered into nutrition analysis software (FoodWorks V.9)<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> to obtain the nutrient profile. FoodWorks is a commercially available software program that contains the latest and most comprehensive Australian and New Zealand food data and is the industry standard in nutritional analysis software for dietitians and researchers.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> A quality assurance process will be adopted as part of the menu assessments, whereby one dietitian will conduct the assessment and a second dietitian will confirm each item classification. Any discrepancies will be resolved between the two dietitians, and if needed a third dietitian will be consulted to settle the discrepancy. The proposed process is consistent with menu assessment procedures used in a number of previous studies conducted by the research team.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 48 49</xref>

One full school term (10 weeks) of purchasing data will be provided at each time point for analysis. Each menu item in the online canteen system is assigned a unique product ID code.

For each school, a second research assistant will perform a quality assurance check of approximately 10% of the canteen menu items, to ensure that the nutrition profile has been correctly matched to the purchasing data. Special event orders (eg, end of term pizza lunch) will be excluded from analysis, given canteen managers typically create a new menu for these events which may not have the intervention strategies applied. Similarly, recurring orders (ie, orders placed ahead of time to be repeated regularly without the need for the user to subsequently engage with the online canteen system) will be excluded from analysis as the user may not have been exposed to the intervention strategies.</p>

                <p>As dose–response relationships exist between three of the four primary outcomes (saturated fat,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> sugar<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> and sodium<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and dietary-related clinical health outcomes, the sample size calculation was based on the estimated between group differences in daily energy intake that would be required to offset unhealthy weight gain.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> It is expected that approximately 194 students at each school will place at least one online lunch order during the baseline data collection period, and that 86% of those of students will order within the follow-up data collection period, and that 70% of orders are placed using a mobile device (and will be included in the analysis). Assuming that a standard lunch order has a SD of 616 kJ, and assuming an ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) of 0.05, the participation of 26 schools (13 each arm) would enable detection of a 195 kJ difference between groups at follow-up with 80% power at the Bonferroni adjusted level of 0.0125 significance level (preserving a family-wise type 1 error rate of 5%).</p>

                <title>Economic analysis</title>
                <p>A trial-based economic evaluation involving costing, cost-consequence analysis and, subject to assessment of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness analysis, will be undertaken. The intervention will be compared against the control group (usual-practice) from a societal perspective. Resource use will be identified, measured and valued for the intervention development, implementation and sustainability stages. It will be assumed that control schools will incur no additional costs beyond the use of the online ordering system (ie, usual practice). Micro costing will be used to calculate the system level and school level cost associated with the intervention. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated as the difference in mean total cost divided by the observed difference in the primary outcome of kilojoules. Uncertainty analysis will be undertaken using non-parametric bootstrapping to derive uncertainty intervals around the key variables as well as the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Sensitivity and scenario analysis will be undertaken to test the impact of changing key design features of the intervention and scale-up of the implementation model.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This trial adopts a rigorous cluster randomised controlled design and tests the effectiveness of an intervention that is integrated into an existing online canteen system with wide reach throughout Australian schools. The intervention will be evaluated using routinely collected lunch order purchasing data from thousands of primary school students. The results should be considered in the context of the strengths and limitations of the research. The external validity of the findings may be limited given the application of this intervention only to primary schools from one Australian state, although the inclusion of all school types across socioeconomic strata is a strength. Furthermore, study findings may be limited due to the use of purchasing data as opposed to consumption data, and an inability to identify the person placing the order (ie, a student ordering for themselves or a parent ordering on behalf of a student). Notwithstanding these limitations, it is anticipated that the trial results will be used to inform future implementation of public health nutrition interventions through school canteens and may be transferrable to other online systems for ordering food.</p>
