                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Sciatica is a lower spine condition characterised by radiating leg pain below the knee. It may be accompanied by motor and sensory loss in the distribution of a spinal nerve. There are few effective treatments for sciatica. Orally administered glucocorticoids have shown some promise, however, any beneficial effects need to be confirmed and weighed against drug safety and cost-effectiveness, in a high-quality, definitive trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The Oral Steroids In Sciatica (OASIS) trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that will evaluate a tapering regimen of oral prednisolone in 200 participants with acute sciatica. Participants will be recruited on presentation to general practice, specialist outpatient clinics or hospital emergency departments and randomised to receive orally administered prednisolone 50 mg per day, up to 3 days then tapering to cessation over 10 days, or placebo, for a maximum of 13 days, in addition to guideline advice. Participants will be followed for 1 year. The primary endpoint will be leg pain intensity at 2 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include back pain intensity, disability, time to recovery, quality of life and treatment success rate. Adverse events will be assessed and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Sciatica is a symptom characterised by pain radiating down the back of the leg, in the distribution of a lumbar nerve (radicular pain), most often due to compression of a nerve root (L4 to S3) by a herniated intervertebral disc. It may be accompanied by back pain, motor or sensory deficits and changes in reflexes. Most cases occur in the fourth and fifth decades of life.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> With a lifetime prevalence reported between 12.2% and 43.0% and point prevalence between 1.5% and 13.4%, sciatica is a common condition that has important physical, psychological and economic impacts.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> While back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> the subset of people with sciatica has greater disability, higher pain, longer absence from work and consume more health resources than people with back pain but no sciatica.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 7</xref></p>
              <p>There are few effective treatments to alleviate sciatica, irrespective of symptom duration (acute or chronic).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–12</xref> Our previously published trial showed that pregabalin, a drug used to treat neuropathic pain, did not improve outcomes compared with placebo in people with sciatica, but significantly increased the risk of adverse events.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A review also showed that common analgesics such as paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioid analgesics (and their combination) are no more effective than placebo in reducing pain or disability caused by sciatica.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> In addition, there is also little evidence that non-pharmacological, non-invasive interventions (eg, physical therapy) are effective for people with sciatica. However, exercise (isometric trunk and lower limb exercises) has been shown to provide a small treatment effect in the short term (compared with advice) for people with chronic sciatica, but there is no clear benefit of exercise for acute sciatica (&lt;3 months duration).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>Treating sciatica with glucocorticoids is based on a pharmacologically plausible rationale. Sciatica is the most commonly caused by compression of a lumbar nerve root due to disc herniation,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but mechanical compression alone may not be sufficient to cause symptoms.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Emerging data suggest that both compression and a secondary inflammatory response may be required to provoke leg pain, especially in acute cases<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> as pain severity is more closely linked to inflammatory changes than in chronic sciatica.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Glucocorticoids are inhibitors of inflammatory processes and are believed to exert their anti-inflammatory actions via repression of proinflammatory mediators.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Thus the rationale for using glucocorticoids such as prednisone or prednisolone in acute sciatica is to reduce the inflammation and oedema associated with the inflammatory changes around the nerve root<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and alleviating symptoms and signs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>Most systematic review evidence evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy for sciatica focused on epidural administration. These reviews reported epidural glucocorticoid injections have a small, but short-term treatment benefit (mean difference against placebo=−6.2 on a 100-point pain scale, 95% CI=−9.4 to −3.0).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>Importantly, epidural injections are comparatively more complex and generally more expensive, second-line treatments. Furthermore, the invasive nature of this procedure means that there is potential for serious although rare adverse events.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In contrast, short-term systemic glucocorticoid could be a simple, low-cost, first-line treatment option for sciatica with an acceptable risk profile and may have a longer duration of effect at the target site than a single, one-off epidural injection.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref></p>
              <p>However, current clinical evidence of systemic glucocorticoids for sciatica is inconclusive. The 2017 back pain guideline from the American College of Physicians does not recommend systemic glucocorticoids be used to treat acute sciatica, based on a review of six trials that found no effect on acute pain and none to a small effect on disability.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In contrast, a 2017 <italic>British Medical Journal</italic> review reported that glucocorticoids have some effects on pain and disability.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The challenge with existing evidence in the area is that the doses and drug formulations of glucocorticoids vary considerably across trials and at times patients with any symptom duration were combined in the analyses. This provides little meaningful guidance on issues such as optimal formulation and duration of glucocorticoid treatment or the ideal time to initiate therapy with respect to symptom duration.</p>
              <p>In our 2019 review,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> we identified a total of nine trials (n=717 participants) and found inconclusive, mostly low-quality evidence on the efficacy of glucocorticoids administered via the oral, intramuscular or intravenous routes. We identified some promise of a short (15-day) course of oral prednisone for acute sciatica, with one trial showing reductions in pain and disability in the long term with such a regimen.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is generally considered safe, and any adverse events are usually reversible on cessation of drug treatment.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Long-term use of glucocorticoids is associated with serious risks including osteoporotic fractures, dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance and glucocorticoid-induced avascular bone necrosis.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Such risks are less relevant in the treatment of sciatica, where glucocorticoids are typically used as short-term therapy.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, there are potential harms associated with short-term glucocorticoid therapy.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Our systematic review found that those who received oral glucocorticoids had an almost twofold greater risk of adverse events such as nausea or light-headedness compared with placebo (risk ratio=2.1, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.1, one study).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Because glucocorticoids are already used in routine care to treat sciatica (spinal conditions are one of the main indications for adults to be prescribed glucocorticoids in the USA),<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and their benefits are largely unclear, we need to establish whether they have benefits that outweigh the possible harms of these medicines for people with sciatica.</p>
              <p>Finding a simple, effective and low-cost, first-line treatment option for acute sciatica is a priority. Our review findings suggest a possible benefit of early glucocorticoid therapy for sciatica as more notable benefits were seen when treatment was commenced early (ie, in acute cases).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Oral glucocorticoids in particular have the potential to provide a simple, low-cost treatment solution in acute sciatica. However, as questions remain around whether oral glucocorticoids can provide clinically worthwhile benefit, effectiveness needs to be confirmed and considered against drug safety and cost-effectiveness, in a high-quality, definitive trial. We propose a randomised placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral glucocorticoids compared with placebo in people with acute sciatica. Informed by previous trials, we will use glucocorticoids administered early in the course of sciatica.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> If found to be efficacious and safe, oral glucocorticoids would be a conservative treatment for patients with acute sciatica.</p>

                <p>All participants will receive guideline-recommended advice from a study doctor. This advice includes reassurance (of the benign pathology and prognosis), advice to stay active and to avoid bed rest and commonly recommended medicines. Study doctors will be trained on the trial protocol and receive regular monitoring visits from the trial team to ensure adherence to the trial protocol.</p>
                <sec id="s2-4-1">
                  <title>Trial medication</title>
                  <p>Study doctors will prescribe and supply the study medication (either oral prednisolone or placebo). We have selected a dosing regimen which is similar to that used in the Goldberg <italic>et al</italic>’s trial<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> as our early preparatory work for the current trial found no consensus on glucocorticoid dosing recommendations. We conducted a number of consultations with clinicians (including primary care general practitioners, rheumatologists and sports physicians) but there was no clear consensus on an appropriate dose and duration of treatment. Our chosen regimen also balances the need for an adequate anti-inflammatory dose while mitigating the risk of adverse events.</p>
                  <p>The proposed medication regimen is pragmatic and involves a short tapering course of oral prednisolone, commencing with a high dose and tapering to cessation over 13 days. In our trial, participants will receive prednisolone 50 mg for up to 3 days, followed by 25 mg for up to 5 days, followed by 12.5 mg for up to 5 days. Trial medicines will be provided as 16 whole tablets of 25 mg prednisolone (or identical placebo) for each participant to complete the study dosing regimen: in order to maintain the stability and integrity of the study medication, only whole tablets will be provided. Participants will be supplied with a pill cutter to allow for halving of tablets during the final 5 days of the tapering regimen. The maximum duration from commencement to cessation will be 13 days with the maximum cumulative dose of 337.5 mg. The dose can be adjusted by the study doctor depending on individual progress and tolerability. For example, if a participant experiences side effects (eg, difficulty sleeping), the initial prednisolone dose can be lowered to 25 mg per day. If a participant reaches ‘adequate improvement’ (0 to 1 out of 10 pain for 3 consecutive days),<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> dose reduction can start earlier.</p>
                  <p>The decreasing dose regimen will be communicated by the study doctor to the participant on the day of their enrolment into the study. The doctor will provide this advice verbally and will also write it down for the participant.</p>
                  <p>To monitor adherence to the study medicines, study doctors will be asked to record the study medication prescribed and participants will be asked to record their intake in a daily diary, plus return any unused medicines for counting at the end of the trial.</p>

                  <p>All participants may receive additional care during the treatment period as deemed appropriate by their study doctor. This may include physical or manual therapies or other medications except systemic glucocorticoids (oral or injection by any route). Concomitant use of inhaled and topical corticosteroids is permitted. We will record the use of concomitant analgesia/therapies. The efficacy of common analgesics (paracetamol, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants and opioids) is either minimal or unclear in the context of acute sciatica.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 31</xref> Furthermore, due to the randomised nature of our study, we expect concomitant use of analgesics will be similar in both groups. Therefore, we have permitted concomitant analgesic use in this trial.</p>

                <p>To maintain the overall quality and rigour of the study design, unblinding to the blinded study personnel should only occur in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment is absolutely essential for further management of the participant. The decision for this will be made in consultation with the clinicians involved in the participant’s management (including the study doctor) and the Steering Committee.</p>
                <p>If unblinding is deemed necessary, the study team will facilitate contact between the clinicians involved in the participant’s management and the independent statistician who generated the randomisation sequence, and care will be made to ensure that only the study personnel who will be involved in further management of that participant will be unblinded. Unblinding should not necessarily be a reason for study discontinuation.</p>
                <p>At the completion of the study, unblinding will occur once data analysis and interpretation are complete.</p>

                <title>Data collection methods</title>
                <p>After a participant has given consent for the study, the study doctor will notify the research team. For a participant to be officially enrolled in the study, a blinded research assistant will collect baseline data directly from the participant before the participant starts the study medication and within 72 hours of visiting the study doctor. Follow-up data will be collected by a research assistant by phone or by the participant online. Research assistants will be trained to maintain blinding and ensure data accuracy, consistency and completeness.</p>

                <p>Questions will be asked regarding blinding and satisfaction at week 2. The blinding question will ask the participant to guess to which study treatment they were randomised, that is whether they have been randomised to prednisolone or placebo, or do not know. The satisfaction question will ask the participant to rate how satisfied they felt with the study treatment overall on a 5-point scale (extremely dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied or extremely satisfied).</p>

An initial meeting of the DSMC will be held around 6 months after commencement of participant recruitment and subsequent meetings will be scheduled at the discretion of the DSMC or at the request of the OASIS Steering Committee. A suggested schedule is for the DSMC to meet when one-third of the participants (n=66) have been recruited, then when two-third of the participants (n=133) have been recruited, or yearly from the time of the initial meeting whichever is more frequent.</p>
