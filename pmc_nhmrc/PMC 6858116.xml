                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Indigenous peoples who have experienced colonisation or oppression can have a higher prevalence of alcohol-related harms. In Australia, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs) offer culturally accessible care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) peoples. However there are many competing health, socioeconomic and cultural client needs.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A randomised cluster wait-control trial will test the effectiveness of a model of tailored and collaborative support for ACCHSs in increasing use of alcohol screening (with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C)) and of treatment provision (brief intervention, counselling or relapse prevention medicines).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>Twenty-two ACCHSs across Australia.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Randomisation</title>
                  <p>Services will be stratified by remoteness, then randomised into two groups. Half receive support soon after the trial starts (intervention or ‘early support’); half receive support 2 years later (wait-control or ‘late support’).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>The support</title>
                  <p>Core support elements will be tailored to local needs and include: support to nominate two staff as champions for increasing alcohol care; a national training workshop and bimonthly teleconferences for service champions to share knowledge; onsite training, and bimonthly feedback on routinely collected data on screening and treatment provision.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcomes and analysis</title>
                  <p>Primary outcome is use of screening using AUDIT-C as routinely recorded on practice software. Secondary outcomes are recording of brief intervention, counselling, relapse prevention medicines; and blood pressure, gamma glutamyltransferase and HbA1c. Multi-level logistic regression will be used to test the effectiveness of support.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval has been obtained from eight ethics committees: the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of New South Wales (1217/16); Central Australian Human Research Ethics Committee (CA-17-2842); Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Health Research (2017-2737); Central Queensland Hospital and Health Service (17/QCQ/9); Far North Queensland (17/QCH/45-1143); Aboriginal Health Research Ethics Committee, South Australia (04-16-694); St Vincent’s Hospital (Melbourne) Human Research Ethics Committee (LRR 036/17); and Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (779).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Globally, alcohol is the leading cause of loss of healthy life years for people between the ages of 15 and 49.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Indigenous peoples dealing with colonisation and oppression can be at higher risk of mental illness and harms from alcohol.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In Australia, the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) people who drink alcohol is less than non-Indigenous people.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, Indigenous Australians are 2–8 times more likely to be hospitalised for alcohol-related conditions<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and nine times more likely to die from alcohol-related harms.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This directly impacts on the health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These increased risks and harms from drinking can be related to experiences of trauma, grief, poverty and cultural dispossession, resulting in increased mental illness, trans-generational trauma and lower life expectancy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4 6</xref> The lack of community autonomy and access to culturally appropriate treatment services also contribute.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>Early detection of unhealthy drinking (ie, of hazardous, harmful or dependent alcohol use)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> plays a key role in reducing the overall burden of alcohol conditions, particularly before people develop health problems or social impacts such as incarceration related to alcohol use.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> Internationally, alcohol screening and brief intervention approaches have been found to be cost-effective in reducing unhealthy drinking, particularly for those who are not dependent on alcohol.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 12</xref> However across Australian primary care settings, screening and brief intervention for unhealthy drinking are not always standardised,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> informed by Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) drinking guidelines,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> or systematically conducted. It is estimated that 50%–70% of people with unhealthy drinking go undetected in Australian primary care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Similarly only 57% of attendees were screened for unhealthy drinking in four Indigenous primary care settings in Queensland, Australia (in 2007).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Also, when alcohol dependence is present, pharmacological treatments to reduce risk of relapse are not regularly prescribed in primary healthcare.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>
</p>
              <p>Culturally specific healthcare services that are led and delivered by Indigenous peoples can have a key role in improving quality of healthcare and treatment access.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs) provide accessible and culturally appropriate healthcare to Indigenous communities across Australia. Each ACCHS has its own holistic service delivery model for the communities that they serve.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As with mainstream (general population) services, knowledge and practice of screening and brief intervention vary between and within Indigenous primary care services.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 21 22</xref> Some ACCHSs have an alcohol and other drug (AOD) worker or team, or links with external AOD specialists/services. Others may have no specific AOD expertise and health practitioners may lack confidence in delivering alcohol care (ie, screening, brief intervention, counselling or medicines). Prior to 2017, the Australian government had asked ACCHS staff to record clients’ alcohol use as ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’, ‘non-drinker’ or ‘ex-drinker’.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However health practitioners may or may not have known current drinking guidelines or have applied these to assess the risk.</p>
              <p>To increase standardisation of alcohol screening in ACCHSs, in July 2017 the use of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) was added as a national key performance indicator for ACCHSs.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> AUDIT-C<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> is a 3-item screening tool, comprised of the first three questions of the 10-item AUDIT.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This short form has been shown to have good sensitivity and specificity in comparison to the full AUDIT.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Several studies suggest that AUDIT-C is valid in Indigenous primary care settings, though further study into culturally appropriate delivery is suggested.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref>
</p>
              <p>Internationally, research suggests that support can help primary care services increase implementation of alcohol screening and brief intervention<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> or provision of pharmacotherapies for relapse prevention in alcohol dependence.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Support which is multi-faceted, and targets several areas of a health service seems particularly promising.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> For example the approach may target not just doctors, but other professionals, clients, and organisational systems.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Continuing quality improvement approaches may offer sustainable benefit, including in ACCHSs.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However there have been very few studies of culturally relevant support models for ACCHSs in alcohol care,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 30</xref> with even fewer conducted by Indigenous researchers.</p>
              <p>This paper outlines the trial protocol for testing if a model of support can assist ACCHSs to integrate the mainstream evidence base on alcohol care with their own cultural and clinical expertise. The use of an inactive control group can be challenging on ethical and partnership grounds, particularly for vulnerable communities. In contrast, a wait-control design allows support to be delivered to all participating ACCHSs.</p>

                <title>Overview</title>
                <p>A cluster randomised trial will test the effectiveness of a model of tailored and collaborative support to increase the use of AUDIT-C and evidence-based treatment in ACCHSs compared with care as usual. Culturally relevant supports will be offered with the aim of increasing staff skills and capacity to develop, refine and deliver systems for alcohol care. These supports will be based on current evidence and be in-line with services’ cultural-care practices. Twenty-two ACCHSs will be recruited across Australia. Services will be randomised into two arms, an early support (intervention) and a late support (wait-control) arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p>

However, approaches will be tailored to the needs of each ACCHS, for what works best for their service, clients and communities.</p>
                <p>The core support elements were designed based on evidence-based approaches for supporting implementation of alcohol care.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 29</xref> The project team also drew on their experience working within (six authors) and with Aboriginal health services; and in health workforce development (nine authors). Advice was also received from ACCHS peak organisations and networks in New South Wales and South Australia, and from a research team conducting a quality improvement trial for ACCHSs on diabetes screening.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
</p>
                <p>At the start of the early support phase, the support will be refined based on preliminary analysis of qualitative data from staff interviews and after feedback from the initial national workshop for early support service representatives. Tailoring and further minor refinement of support will occur during the trial, informed by service feedback.</p>
                <p>Early support (‘intervention’) services will receive the support soon after the trial starts (1 year of active support, 1 year maintenance phase). Late support (wait-control) services will receive the same intervention elements 2 years after the start of the early-support phase. Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind participants or staff as to which services are receiving support.</p>

                    <p>Each ACCHS will be provided with funding to purchase additional resources. Services can choose, in partnership with the chief investigators, how they spend their funding. The early support arm of the project will receive up to $9000 for resources. The late support arm will receive up to $3500. This is a reduced sum as they will have access to resources developed within the early support phase, so time and development costs will be less. Resources must be alcohol-related and may include additional training, conference attendance, education resources for staff or clients, funds for health promotion events or for local adaptation of resources.</p>

Some ACCHSs may choose to make modifications to Communicare to make alcohol ‘clinical items’ more accessible for staff. One example is adding AUDIT-C into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) health assessment (‘Adult Health Check’), which was not routine in standard versions of Communicare at the time of trial commencement. AUDIT-C can also be added to other regular assessments such as antenatal and the pre-consult examination (ie, routine observations and/screening by a nurse or Aboriginal health worker before seeing the doctor). Services will also be provided with information about existing fields (‘clinical items’) available on Communicare for recording episodes of alcohol care (education/advice; on-site counselling), which can then be retrieved by data extraction.</p>

                  <p>Interviews will be conducted by two Indigenous staff with experience working with ACCHS and conducting interviews. One interviewer will facilitate the interview while the other will live-transcribe. The interviewers will compare and discuss notes after each interview.

In addition the following variables will be extracted, each one linked to an individual client ID and the date the variable was recorded: AUDIT-C responses; the clinicians’ perception of the client’s drinking status (‘Ex-drinker’, ‘Non-drinker’, ‘Within safe drinking limits’ or ‘Unsafe - needs intervention’); whether a brief intervention, or a counselling session for alcohol use was provided; whether a relapse prevention medication was prescribed (ie, acamprosate, naltrexone or disulfiram); and if measured, a range of biological markers which may be affected by alcohol consumption (BP, HbA1C and GGT).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale randomised trial testing whether external support can enhance uptake of evidence-based alcohol care in services for Indigenous peoples. This study will add knowledge in the field of screening, early intervention and treatment for Indigenous peoples of Australia and inform future research and policy development. The findings are also likely to be relevant for Indigenous peoples internationally who have similar experiences of colonisation and inter-generational trauma. The research will also have relevance for non-Indigenous health services.</p>
              <p>A strength of this study is its feasibility across a large number of services due to the use of routinely collected data. However, it is not within the project’s resources to assess the quality of data recording. For example, it is likely that some brief discussions of alcohol use will go unrecorded, or will be entered as free text (which is not readily extractable), rather than in the specified fields (‘clinical items’). Also, some forms of alcohol risk are not reflected in the AUDIT-C, for example, drinking while pregnant. While we examine health indicators as secondary outcomes (AUDIT-C score, BP, HbA1C, GGT), these may not be sensitive or specific enough to be allowed a confident assessment of any reduction in alcohol-related risk or improvement in client health. AUDIT-C scores may in fact become higher with improved quality of screening. In future, data linkage studies (eg, examining hospital presentations) could allow more definitive assessment of health benefits of a model of service-wide support.</p>
              <p>The model of support is designed to be culturally appropriate, collaborative, and tailored to individual service needs. The model is based on the use of champions within services and feedback of routinely collected data, so has potential to be sustainable, allowing for continuing quality improvement. The model also has potential to be scaled up for longer-term support of ACCHSs Australia-wide. The need for tailoring and flexibility in support elements provides challenges for analysis. However, this approach is ethically and practically necessary for working in partnership with Indigenous services. This type of local tailoring also has value for non-Indigenous clinical services in culturally and geographically diverse regions.</p>
