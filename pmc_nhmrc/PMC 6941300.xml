                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Depression frequently first emerges during adolescence, and one in five young people will experience an episode of depression by the age of 18â€‰years. Despite advances in treatment, there has been limited progress in addressing the burden at a population level. Accordingly, there has been growing interest in prevention approaches as an additional pathway to address depression. Depression can be prevented using evidence-based psychological programmes. However, barriers to implementing and accessing these programmes remain, typically reflecting a requirement for delivery by clinical experts and high associated delivery costs. Digital technologies, specifically smartphones, are now considered a key strategy to overcome the barriers inhibiting access to mental health programmes. The Future Proofing Study is a large-scale school-based trial investigating whether cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) delivered by smartphone application can prevent depression.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A randomised controlled trial targeting up to 10,000â€‰Year 8 Australian secondary school students will be conducted. In Stage I, schools will be randomised at the cluster level either to receive the CBT intervention app (SPARX) or to a non-active control group comparator. The primary outcome will be symptoms of depression, and secondary outcomes include psychological distress, anxiety and insomnia. At the 12-month follow-up, participants in the intervention arm with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in an individual-level randomised controlled trial (Stage II) and be randomised to receive a second CBT app which targets sleep difficulties (Sleep Ninja) or a control condition. Assessments will occur post intervention (both trial stages) and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post baseline. Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach and compare changes in symptoms from baseline to follow-up relative to the control group using mixed-effect models.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This is the first trial testing the effectiveness of smartphone apps delivered to school students to prevent depression at scale. Results from this trial will provide much-needed insight into the feasibility of this approach. They stand to inform policy and commission decisions concerning if and how such programmes should be deployed in school-based settings in Australia and beyond.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par9">According to the World Health Organization, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For many individuals, depression first emerges during adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], between age 10 and 24â€‰years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately one in five young people will experience a depressive episode by the age of 18â€‰years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with earlier onset being associated with a range of adverse consequences including poor academic performance, low levels of school attendance, social dysfunction, substance abuse, anxiety, suicidality, poor sleep, diabetes and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As adolescents develop, the foundations are laid for successful transition into the varied roles of adulthood including the time in life when employment productivity peaks. Experiencing depression as a young person can negatively impact psychological, social, emotional, educational and vocational pathways into adulthood, with profound implications for the individual, their families and their communities, as well as the economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The global cost of mental illness is nearly US$2.5 trillion, two-thirds of which is incurred via indirect costs such as unemployment. This cost is expected to increase to US$6000,000,000,000 by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. By way of benchmarking, total global health expenditure in 2009 was US$5.1 trillion, of which less than 2% is spent on mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The immense cost of mental illness, together with the social and emotional consequences associated with earlier onset, highlights the crucial importance of prevention or intervention early in the course of illness, and, consequently, at an early age.</p>
              <p id="Par10">There has been little progress in recent years addressing this challenge. Estimates suggest that only 13% of the disease burden due to depression can be alleviated through current treatments and service models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Even with optimal clinician competence, improved access and treatment adherence, only 36% of the burden is avoidable, leaving substantial unaddressed morbidity and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Currently, fewer than one-third of young people seek help and gain access to first-line interventions for reasons that include accessibility, stigma and affordability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Of those who seek professional help, between 30 and 50% of young people do not respond to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and among those who do, over 45% will experience a subsequent depressive episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This has led to growing recognition that treatment alone will not successfully reduce the burden of depression at a population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Prevention represents a separate pathway through which the burden of depression may be addressed. There has been bourgeoning interest in the use of preventive approaches, with several high-quality but small-scale prevention studies demonstrating that the prevention of depression is possible in school-aged young people. Several recent meta-analyses have examined the effect of psychological prevention programmes specifically on adolescents and found consistent but small effect sizes in favour of delivering CBT for depression, at least in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Of the prevention programmes that are available, those based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) have been the most frequently evaluated interventions, with evidence to support these approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Other approaches may prove effective but have not yet been subject to rigorous empirical evaluation. CBT involves challenging unhelpful thoughts or beliefs, by gathering evidence which contradict these thoughts or beliefs from real-world situations. This leads to changes in emotion and behaviour. CBT is structured, brief and time-limited, and aims to help individuals develop skills and strategies to manage their own mood and depression. Prevention approaches can be delivered either universally to all individuals within an identified population regardless of risk (universal prevention), or targeted to those with risk factors such as low socio-economic background (selective prevention) or to those who have sub-threshold disorder symptoms (indicated prevention). While there is evidence for all three prevention approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], there have typically been larger effects reported for targeted approaches, at least in part due to limitations in the statistical power of universal prevention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Despite consistent statistically and clinically meaningful effects in existing prevention studies, these studies have been limited by several factors. First, trials have generally involved small sample sizes, and the consequent limited statistical power means that potential effects go undetected and/or are measured imprecisely. Specifically, the median sample size identified in a recent meta-analysis of 47 studies examining the prevention of depression was 208, with an average effect size of <italic>g</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Samples of this size are insufficient because preventive programmes, particularly universally delivered programmes, necessarily expose a large proportion of individuals not at risk to the intervention, and yield small to modest effects because of the low base rates of disorder in general population samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Second, studies have rarely involved follow-up beyond 12â€‰months, which limits what is known about long-term preventive effects. Third, studies have relied solely on self-report or clinician-reported symptoms. While subjective reports reflect the gold-standard approach and are useful clinically, there is much to be gained by the inclusion of additional objectively quantifiable data sources (e.g., health care utilisation data, smartphone-collected sensor data). Fourth, most prevention approaches involve the delivery of a single intervention or programme. There is rarely an option to identify who is most likely to respond to different interventions, or for a tiered approach whereby individuals for whom one approach has not been effective may try a different approach afterwards. This is potentially a missed opportunity given that not everyone will respond to a single, or the first-line, approach. Finally, CBT has, until recently, been delivered to young people generally over 6â€“12 sessions using face-to-face approaches which are challenging to scale due to the expertise and cost required to deliver such programmes. Digital approaches may be easier to scale up; however, in a review of 146 randomised controlled prevention trials, only two involved digitally delivered interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In light of these limitations, there is scope to improve on and extend the empirical base to understand the effects of depression prevention programmes.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>The current study</title>
                <p id="Par13">The Future Proofing Study has been designed to overcome these challenges by conducting a large school-based randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing whether depression can be prevented using a CBT programme delivered by smartphone application. Research evidence to date suggests that digital CBT programmes for depression delivered in schools can be effective in reducing and preventing depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Partnering in the delivery of prevention programmes is a natural fit for schools, which are increasingly seen as settings in which to foster emotional skill development alongside traditional academic learning. Mental ill health is associated with poorer academic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and depressed young people miss an average of 22â€‰days of school per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], making mental well-being in line with the goals of educators and school administrators. Importantly, schools provide access to large student samples which are more representative of the general population than other settings, such as mental health services or medical practices. In addition, the potential to deliver a prevention programme to all students universally may help reduce the stigma often associated with the delivery of mental health interventions only to those with symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">This trial will involve up to 10,000 Australian school students who will be followed up for 5 years. A sample of this size provides appropriate statistical power to definitively and precisely evaluate effectiveness, as well as providing the opportunity to conduct robust moderation and mediation analyses. All study protocols will be delivered to participants digitally. The intervention/s will be delivered by smartphone application (apps)Â and study surveys can be completed on any Internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). This delivery method overcomes the aforementioned challenges associated with delivery by trained health professionals or teachers. It is simply too costly to train enough of the workforce to deliver CBT prevention programmes either individually or in small groups to make an impact at a population level. Delivering interventions digitally is more cost-effective than face-to-face therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, programmes using a smartphone app for delivery do not compromise effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Testing smartphone apps represents a major innovation of this project, with most evaluation of digital programmes focusing on Internet-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Digital technologies, and specifically smartphones, are now considered a key strategy to overcome the barriers inhibiting access to mental health programmes. This mode of delivery is appropriate given that young people show a preference for digital technologies when given the choice, due to the anonymity, convenience and privacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par15">This SPIRIT-compliant protocol describes the methodology for a multi-stage, two-arm, parallel group RCT (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At Stage I, a cluster RCT will be undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of SPARX, which is an app-based CBT gaming intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This intervention has been tested in the Australian adolescent population and was found to be effective for the prevention of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the current trial, SPARX will be delivered to Year 8 students (who are typically aged 12â€“14â€‰years). The control group will consist of Year 8 students of an equivalent demographic who will not receive any intervention. Participants across both arms will be followed longitudinally over 5 years. The choice to use a non-active (treatment-as-usual) comparator was made to avoid placing unnecessary burden on the participants and schools, which would have been required to provide an attention-matched placebo interventionâ€”an intervention that would have required an equivalent level of effort to that of the active conditionâ€”that would most likely provide no benefit. Other candidate programmes that may have benefited other outcomes such as lifestyle or nutrition programmes could not serve as a fair control condition because of their likely impact on mental health. At Stage II (12â€‰months following baseline), an individual-level RCT will be conducted within the intervention arm. Individuals who show elevated symptoms of depression at 12â€‰months will be randomised to an intervention condition that receives a second CBT app which targets sleep difficulties (Sleep Ninja) or a control condition. Sleep Ninja focuses on sleep disturbances and delivers cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). An intervention targeting sleep difficulties was selected because sleep disturbance is both a risk factor and a symptom of depression, with efficacy supporting its use in the prevention and treatment of depression in both adults and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>

                <title>Aims</title>
                <p id="Par16">This trial will investigate the impact of two mental health apps on adolescent depression. The first objective of this trial is to determine whether delivering a CBT programme via smartphone application can prevent high school students in Year 8 from developing depressive symptoms compared to students in the control arm. This study will assess the effect of the programme on a range of secondary outcomes, which include mental health symptoms (distress, anxiety, insomnia) at post intervention, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60â€‰months. The effect of a second intervention on depression in those who show elevated depressive symptoms 1 year after using the first SPARX app will also be evaluated. Individual differences associated with response to the interventions will also be investigated, including demographics, history of mental illness, personality factors, social support, social media use and gender identification, among a range of other variables (see TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the control group, these factors will be examined as possible predictors for the development of depressive symptoms and other mental health problems.

                <p id="Par17">The second objective of the trial is to identify the predictors of mental health outcomes from digital behavioural and cognitive data collected using participantsâ€™ smartphones (see TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for details). Sensor data will be collected from smartphones to provide information about activity levels (accelerometery), movement through space (GPS) and voice patterns to generate a â€˜digital phenotypeâ€™ for each participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Digital phenotyping can be understood as using sensor data collected by personal devices to quantify the individual-level human phenotype. One of the functions of profiling individuals using digital phenotypes in this way is to make predictions about changes in mental health. The sensors in smartphones provide a non-intrusive, minimally burdensome and scalable method to investigate the effect of activity and behaviour on mental health. Evidence of the validity of this approach is beginning to emerge, with location variability now showing an association with depression outcomes in small studies of adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the use of digital phenotyping approaches in young people at scale has not yet been undertaken. For participants in the intervention group, this information will be combined with intervention usage data and other study measures to explore predictors of response and non-response to the intervention apps. In the control group, this information will be used to prospectively examine predictors of psychopathology.

The data that will be collected to meet this objective will combine intervention usage with qualitative and quantitative methods. A protocol for the process evaluation of the programme implementation will be detailed elsewhere.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Three different forms of data will be collected from this trial to address each of the objectives: self-report questionnaires (first objective), smartphone-recorded sensor data and ecological momentary assessment data (second objective), and usage and implementation data (third objective). This study will also utilise health and education datasets as a fourth form of data that will be linked to the main study datasets 1 year after the trial commences, and then periodically until the trial is complete. Linked data will include academic outcomes, health service utilisation and infant development, alongside births and deaths records.

                <title>Hypotheses</title>
                <p id="Par21">The primary hypothesis is that participants allocated to the intervention arm will show a smaller increase in depressive symptoms relative to those in the control group at 12â€‰months, measured using the self-report Patient Health Questionnaireâ€”Adolescent Version (PHQ-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Secondary hypotheses are that depressive symptoms will be lower (e.g., show a smaller increase) in the intervention arm relative to the control arm at other assessment points (post intervention, 6, 24, 36, 48 and 60â€‰months). Using the pre-defined clinical cut-off points on the PHQ-A will also allow a comparison between likely cases of depression across the two arms. It is hypothesised that the percentage of depression cases will be lower in the intervention arm relative to the control arm at post intervention, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60â€‰months. Secondary mental health outcomes are psychological distress, anxiety and insomnia, and are expected to be lower in the intervention arm relative to the control, at post intervention, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60â€‰months. Additional outcomes including suicidality, substance use and sleep quality will be reported separately.</p>
                <p id="Par22">For participants in the intervention condition who show clinically significant depressive symptoms at 12â€‰months (PHQ-A scoreâ€‰&gt;â€‰10) and who enter Stage II of the trial, it is hypothesised that those who receive the Sleep Ninja intervention will report greater decreases in symptoms of depression (primary outcome), anxiety and insomnia (secondary outcomes) from pre to post intervention (Stage II) and from 12 to 24â€‰months (after they receive the Sleep Ninja intervention), relative to the Stage II control arm.</p>

Cluster randomisation will occur at the school level for the first intervention stage, stratified by school size, school location, school student gender and socio-economic status (full details in <xref rid="Sec54" ref-type="sec">Randomisation</xref> section).</p>
                <p id="Par24">The second intervention stage will occur directly after the 12-month follow-up and involve individual-level randomisation. Stage I of the trial will have eight measurement occasions: baseline (pre-intervention); Stage I post intervention (immediately after completing the Stage I intervention, 6â€‰weeks after baseline); and 6-month, 12-month (primary endpoint), 24-month, 36-month, 48-month and 60-month follow-up. The follow-up period is the time since baseline. For the subset of participants involved in Stage II of the trial, an additional measurement occasion will take place 6â€‰weeks after the Stage II intervention (Stage II post intervention). The trial will take place in three recruitment waves. It was planned that Wave 1 will commence in Term 3, 2019 (July 2019), Wave 2 will commence in Term 2, 2020 (April 2020) and Wave 3 will commence in Term 3, 2020 (July 2020). The Stage I intervention phase (SPARX) will last 6â€‰weeks and have a follow-up period of 5 years. The Stage II intervention phase (Sleep Ninja) will last 6 weeks, occurs 12â€‰months after Stage I (SPARX) and will have a follow-up period of up to 4 years.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p id="Par26">This trial will be conducted in approximately 200 schools located predominantly in New South Wales, Australia. The school system in Australia is divided into threeÂ main school types: government schools, independent schools and Catholic schools. Schools from each of these groups will be recruited into the study. Schools across metropolitan, regional and rural locations will be invited to participate in order to generate a demographically representative sample. Similarly, schools with differing indices of community socio-educational advantage (ICSEA) will be targeted. If recruitment targets are not met, schools in Australian states outside New South Wales will be invited to participate. Recruitment is broadly aligned to the academic calendar, with delivery occurring during Term 2 (April) and Term 3 (July) such that assessment sessions take place during the school calendar year and risk issues can be addressed without delay. The first trial recruitment wave will be conducted primarily in independent schools in metropolitan Sydney and the Central Coast for reasons of convenience. The second and third waves will include both metropolitan and non-metropolitan sites, and include government, Catholic and independent schools. Trial management will take place at the Black Dog Institute, a translational research institute located in Sydney, Australia that is affiliated with the University of New South Wales (UNSW).</p>

                <p id="Par31">School principals will be contacted in the first instance. They will be given brief information sheets containing trial details. Schools will have the opportunity to hear more information over the telephone or via video conference. Those who wish to take part will be instructed to sign and return a letter of support. Upon receipt of the letter, schools will be accepted into the trial. In some instances, schools may approach the Black Dog Institute by submitting an expression of interest via a link on the study website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.futureproofing.org.au">www.futureproofing.org.au</ext-link>) or by directly contacting staff at the Black Dog Institute.</p>
                <p id="Par32">After schools have consented, parents and students will be informed about the trial by their school via email or newsletter, depending on school preferences. A study invitation will be circulated to parents. This will include a link to an electronic information sheet and consent form. Here, parents and students can read information about the study, download a PDF copy of the study information sheet and provide electronic consent. Fourteen days following consent form distribution, schools with capacity will make follow-up telephone calls to parents who have not submitted a response. The option to provide verbal consent will be given to these parents. Students whose parents have consented to their participation will be given the opportunity to provide consent electronically at the start of the first study session. On the consent form, participants indicate whether they consent to different components of the study, including the sensor data collection and the linkage component, and whether they provide permission for their data to be included in a data repository for use by other researchers. Consent forms are available from the study website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.futureproofing.org.au">www.futureproofing.org.au</ext-link>). No biological specimens will be collected. Students who do not provide active consent cannot participate in the trial. If a participant withdraws from the study, they are asked to indicate whether they give permission for their already provided data to be used by the study team. All recruitment strategies have ethical approval.</p>
                <p id="Par33">The Black Dog Institute has existing relationships with 100 schools in New South Wales, both through previous research studies and via delivery of community mental health literacy programmes to high school students. These relationships will be leveraged to support school recruitment. To maximise school consent rates, potential schools will be approached at least one school term in advance of study implementation. This means that schools can schedule study activities well in advance. Schools who participate in Wave 1 of the study will also be eligible to participate in Waves 2 or 3 (as these occur in the subsequent year and therefore involve a different cohort). As a universal study, schools will be encouraged to organise data collection assessment sessions as whole-of-classroom activities. To maximise parental consent rates, an information video specifically designed for parents will be made available, and parents have the option to directly contact the research team for further study information.</p>

                  <p id="Par35">SPARX is a gaming intervention that was developed as a treatment programme for mildâ€“moderate depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In its original form as a computerised game, research has shown SPARX to be effective in the treatment of adolescent depression, and equally effective as treatment as usual, which primarily involved face-to-face psychotherapy with a mental health professional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This trial will use SPARX-Future Proofing (SPARX-FP; referred to as SPARX in all other sections of the document), which is an adaptation of SPARX, to make it suitable for the <italic>prevention</italic> of depression, for delivery via mobile phone application. The content is the same, but instead of a focus on existing symptoms and depression, terminology has been updated to focus on times when the participants have felt â€˜down or stressedâ€™ and included skills and strategies reframed to focus on dealing with problems as they arise. The prevention version of SPARX has been trialled in an Australian sample of 540 final-year secondary school students. This trial showed that, relative to a control group, those who used the programme showed lower symptoms of depression in the lead up to final school examinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The move to a mobile phone application from a web-based programme was informed by this previous study finding technological barriers to and participant preferences for delivery via smartphone.</p>
                  <p id="Par36">SPARX consists of seven modules (levels) which cover: finding hope, being active, dealing with strong emotions, problem-solving, recognising unhelpful thoughts, challenging unhelpful thoughts and bringing it all together. Each module takes approximately 20â€‰min to complete. Each module is designed to be completed on separate days, and users are encouraged to do one or two modules per week. Participants will have 6â€‰weeks to complete the SPARX programme on their personal smartphones, in their own time or in class time if schools wish to offer it. Skills learnt through the SPARX programme include emotion identification, emotion regulation, behavioural activation (being active), recognising and challenging unhelpful thoughts and practical problem-solving. This intervention is delivered in a game format, where participants begin by choosing a personalised avatar. The gaming component sees the participant undertaking skill-building challenges in the context of a fantasy world, where the aim is to restore balance in a world taken over by gloomy, negative, automatic thoughts. The gaming component is supplemented by direct instruction, education and activities (or homework) provided by a â€˜guideâ€™ avatar, who relates the content of the programme to usersâ€™ real-life experiences.</p>

The intervention involves psychoeducation, stimulus control, sleep-focused cognitive therapy, basic sleep hygiene and behavioural activation.</p>
                  <p id="Par38">Sleep Ninja takes the form of a chat-bot. When the app is open, conversation messages appear on the phone screen from the Sleep Ninja character (who acts as a sleep coach). Users interact with the Sleep Ninja by selecting from pre-determined responses, to which the Sleep Ninja is programmed to respond. Users progress through six levels or â€˜beltsâ€™, starting at a white belt and working their way through to black belt status by the end of the programme. To level up to the next belt, users must complete within a 1-week period: one training session (which takes approximately 5â€“10â€‰min); and 3 nights of sleep tracking using a sleep diary within the app. At the completion of each level, users are provided with a brief report card and graph summarising their self-reported sleep over that period. There are additional optional app features that users can access, which include a meditation recording, extra sleep information, quick sleep tips and an easy way to send app information to parents. If participants agree, the app sends a reminder each morning to enter sleep tracking from the night before, a reminder an hour before bed to begin winding down in preparation for sleep and a final reminder at bedtime for users to go to bed. Participants will have 6â€‰weeks to complete the Sleep Ninja programme in their own time on their personal smartphones.</p>

School staff will provide verbal reminders and encouragement to students to use the Future Proofing App and, for intervention arm schools, the first intervention app (Stage I; SPARX) during the intervention implementation period. There will also be a $20 one-off incentive to cover any connectivity and data costs, delivered post intervention, to participants in both arms, which may serve to improve adherence. Adherence to the intervention app/s will be monitored by evaluating usage data that are collected automatically by the apps while they are active. Usage data are available at the individual level and consist of when and how many times users enter the apps, how long they spend in the app, how many modules they complete and, for Sleep Ninja only, any sleep tracking data that are input by the user.</p>

This scale has demonstrated good testâ€“retest reliability and convergent validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In this trial, the scale has been adapted to incorporate social media more broadly. A screening item has been added asking respondents to nominate which social media platforms they use at least once per week. Options include: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Other and â€˜I donâ€™t use social mediaâ€™. The seven items of the Maladaptive Facebook Usage Scale were adapted to apply to any social media platform (e.g. â€˜I tend to read the social media status updates of others to see if they are feeling the way I amâ€™ and â€˜Reading the social media status updates of others tends to make me feel down on myselfâ€™). Items are rated on a response scale from 1 (â€˜Strongly disagreeâ€™) to 7 (â€˜Strongly agreeâ€™). Total scale scores can range from 7 to 49. Higher scores indicate greater tendencies to seek online social comparisons and negative evaluations.</p>

An initial preparatory phase and first school visit will solicit parental and student consent, ensure that electronic study questionnaires are accessible by consented students and ensure that the appropriate study apps are installed on each studentâ€™s device. Each subsequent school visit will coincide with an assessment occasion. During these visits, students will access study questionnaires via a secure online portal, accessible using their mobile number and a one-time password sent via SMS. Study personnel will attend these school visits to assist with technical issues and participantsâ€™ questions. Following completion of baseline questionnaires, participants in the intervention condition will be instructed to commence the intervention both during class time and in their own time, and will receive notifications and reminders over the following 6 weeks to do so. Schools are required to schedule four 20-min in-class sessions for intervention completion but may choose to hold additional sessions (up to seven). Participants in the control condition will also be provided with equivalent class time to complete activities on the Future Proofing app. Students who do not complete assessments in school will also have the option to do this in their own time. Students will have up to 4Â weeks following the scheduled assessment date to complete questionnaires at each time point, after which the assessment surveys will be locked and no longer accessible.

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par77">Separate sample size estimates were derived to determine the numbers of participants needed to meet the aims of each trial stage. Power was set at 0.80, Î±â€‰=â€‰0.05 (two-tailed), and a correlation of 0.5 assumed between baseline and endpoint symptom scores. To account for possible clustering effects at Stage I (i.e., participants from the same school having prognostically relevant characteristics and outcomes more alike than between schools), a design effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] was calculated assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.03 (based on previous school-based studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] and a cluster size of 50 students, yielding a design effect of 2.47. In order to detect a mean standardized difference of 0.3 between conditions at Stage I, a sample of 870 participants would be needed (435 per arm). Allowing for up to 30% attrition, recruitment of 1244 participants would be required (622 per arm).</p>
                <p id="Par78">Using similar parameters for Stage II (without a design effect) would require recruitment of 368 participants in total to detect the same effect size. However, participants in this stage must meet eligibility requirements regarding elevated symptoms and failure to respond to the first-stage intervention. They must also be willing to participate. Accordingly, a scenario involving recruitment of 10,000 participants at Stage I was considered, assuming 7000 participants would have endpoint data available at 12â€‰months (allowing for 30% attrition). Conservatively estimating 20% having PHQ-A scores â‰¥â€‰10, 25% showing a reduction due to the Stage I intervention and that 50% of those eligible to enrol at Stage II do so, 525 participants would enter this stage II, with endpoint data available for at least 368 (allowing for up to 30% attrition). This sample would enable the detection of differences in changes in symptomatology scores of comparable size to those in Stage I of the trial (<italic>d</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.29).</p>
                <p id="Par79">Given that a target sample of 10,000 is substantial, if the numbers of participants are not sufficient to reach the Stage II target, then supplementing this sample with additional young people specifically targeted based on PHQ-A scores that fall in the top 20% of population scores to ensure that this stage of the trial has comparable power to Stage I to detect an intervention effect will be considered. This will ensure that sufficient numbers are included at both stages of the trial. Should the target be met, Stage I of the trial will have much higher power to detect changes in symptom scores and would be adequately powered to detect differences in incidence based on PHQ-A diagnosis criteria.</p>
                <p id="Par80">Exploratory analyses for moderating and mediating effects will be feasible at both stages. Stage II will have power to detect small to medium mediation effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Power to detect medium-size effects (0.5 SD) in moderation analyses will be maintained for subgroups down to approximately 120 participants. Power will be enhanced in longitudinal modelling (growth curves) which use multiple occasions of measurement to estimate rates of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>].</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par81">For Stage I, cluster randomisation (at the school level) will be employed for administrative convenience, to avoid control condition contamination, and for the ecological validity of providing the intervention at the cluster level. Schools will be randomised after they are recruited into the trial. The trial statistician who is not involved in the day-to-day running of the trial will perform the randomisation, and the identity of the school will be concealed from the statistician.</p>
                <p id="Par82">Schools will be randomised with a 1:1 allocation, as per a computer-generated randomisation schedule. Balance between the trial arms will be achieved by stratifying based on school size, school location (metropolitan vs. regional), school type (co-educational or gender selective) and Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) level. For Stage II, individual-level randomisation with a 1:1 allocation using a computer-generated randomisation schedule stratified by gender and depression severity scores will be employed. This procedure is automated through the Black Dog Institute research platform. Permuted block randomisation will be used at both stages but will not be disclosed to ensure concealment. Allocation to arms is not directly communicated to schools. However, because the study has no control intervention, schools, participants and study operational staff will be aware of school allocation to the intervention arm. With the exception of the trial data manager, other individuals not involved in the day-to-day running of the trial will remain blind to allocation. All outcome assessments are conducted electronically and not subject to assessor bias. Unblinding at the conclusion of analysis will be performed by the trial data manager with authorisation from the Trial Steering Committee.</p>

The DSMC will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of participants through regular monitoring, including participant safety and adverse events. This group will be responsible for monitoring the efficacy of the interventions being tested on primary outcomes, as well as the overall conduct of the study, including recruitment, protocol compliance, accuracy and completeness of data collection. This group will also provide recommendations with respect to continuing, modifying or terminating the trial, on the basis of feasibility or safety concerns, and will have access to unblinded data. This group can recommend the trial team be unblinded if there are serious safety concerns and meets every 6 months to review trial conduct. There is no anticipated harm from this trial, as it involves a population-based sample and evidence-based interventions. However, should there be any unanticipated harms, this will be monitored by the DSMC, who will provide recommendations about care for affected participants.</p>
                <p id="Par84">All students involved in the trial will be assessed for suicidal thinking and behaviour at each assessment point, using the SIDAS and the YRBS. If participants indicate serious suicidal thinking, plans or behaviour on study surveys, an alert will be triggered whereby the research team and school counsellor are notified immediately using a purpose-built study portal. School counsellors will then follow-up with students within 48â€‰h to offer immediate support, or refer on when necessary, which is recorded in the portal. The research team will monitor this portal and directly contact any counsellors who have not indicated follow-up with students. If students have changed or left schools, parents will be notified. At the 48-month assessment point, when students are in their final year of school, they will also be asked about history of sexual abuse. If students indicate an experience of sexual abuse, this same process of notifying the school counsellor will be followed, and schools will assume the duty of care for mandatory reporting requirements. This information will be communicated to relevant university and school ethics committees, as well as the DSMC following each assessment point.</p>

The current study meets this need by examining a depression-prevention programme, delivered by mobile phone applications, with access facilitated in the school environment that is where young people spend most of their time. This means that, if successful, schools could become the setting in which access to these programmes is rolled out continually, future proofing and inoculating all young people who go through the school system against mental illness.</p>
              <p id="Par95">There are several other features of this trial that make it novel. The use of a two-staged design, such that those who show symptoms of depression at the primary endpoint are randomised to receive a second intervention targeting insomnia, is innovative. This second intervention offers an alternative way to reduce risk for depression onset. The use of smartphone apps as the primary intervention delivery mechanism is new in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>] and promises reduced costs and access barriers compared to traditional face-to-face and health professional-led programmes. The inclusion of smartphone-collected objective data adds another dimension to the trial, allowing for machine learning approaches to explore whether activity and location data are associated with, or predictive of, changes in depression and other mental health symptoms. Moreover, linking this rich dataset to government education and health records will permit direct inferences to be made about the impact of mental illness on health and academic outcomes. Finally, the continuation of follow-up assessments for 5 years means that the long-term effects of the interventions on depression, anxiety, distress, insomnia and additional outcomes can be assessed. The results of The Future Proofing Study stand to provide a major contribution to the field of digital mental health prevention programmes, and knowledge about the population-level impact of preventing depression using these methods.</p>
