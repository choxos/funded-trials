                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Young children with bilateral cerebral palsy (BCP) often experience difficulties with gross motor function, manual ability and posture, impacting developing independence in daily life activities, participation and quality of life. Hand Arm Bimanual Intensive Training Including Lower Extremity (HABIT-ILE) is a novel intensive motor intervention integrating upper and lower extremity training that has been developed and tested in older school-aged children with unilateral and BCP. This study aims to compare an adapted preschool version of HABIT-ILE to usual care in a randomised controlled trial.</p>

                  <p>60 children with BCP aged 2–5 years, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) II–IV will be recruited. Children will be stratified by GMFCS and randomised using concealed allocation to either receive Preschool HABIT-ILE or usual care. Preschool HABIT-ILE will be delivered in groups of four to six children, for 3 hours/day for 10 days (total 30 hours). Children receiving Preschool HABIT-ILE be provided a written home programme with the aim of achieving an additional 10 hours of home practice (total dose 40 hours). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately following intervention and then retention of effects will be tested at 26 weeks. The primary outcome will be the Peabody Developmental Motors Scales–Second Edition to evaluate gross and fine motor skills. Secondary outcomes will be gross motor function (Gross Motor Function Measure-66), bimanual hand performance (Both Hands Assessment), self-care and mobility (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adapted Test), goal attainment (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure), global performance of daily activities (ACTIVLIM-CP), cognition and adaptive function (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function—Preschool Version), habitual physical activity (ActiGraph GT3X+) and quality of life (Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire and Child Health Utility Index-9). Analyses will follow standard principles for RCTs using two-group comparisons on all participants on an intention-to-treat basis. Comparisons between groups for primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted using regression models.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In Australia, cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability in childhood with an estimated 35 000 people currently living with CP.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In high-income countries, the birth prevalence of CP is falling, with Australia reporting a reduction from 1.9 to 1.4/1000 live births between 2007 and 2012.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In addition to the declining rate of CP, motor severity has also reduced, as has the frequency of comorbidities such as epilepsy and intellectual impairment.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The total cost of CP to the Australian economy is $A5.17 billion, equivalent to $A145 662 per person with CP annually, which includes both the financial costs and also those associated with lost well-being.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>There is no cure for CP; it is a life-long condition characterised by increasing physical disability over time.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Over 61% of children with CP have bilateral motor involvement, where the motor disorder impacts both legs, trunk and, for some, one or both arms.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Interventions that reduce the impact of physical disability resulting from CP and promote developing independence in daily life activities, inclusion and community participation are greatly needed. A recent systematic review of interventions for preventing and treating children with CP suggested that given the reduction in both the prevalence and severity of CP (eg, smaller brain injuries and greater baseline motor, sensory and learning ability), children may be more likely now than ever to respond positively to motor interventions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Contemporary proven motor interventions have largely targeted school-aged children with CP and focused on upper and lower extremity motor performance separately.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> To date, significant evidence exists for intensive upper extremity interventions (≈60 hours) to enhance motor performance in children with unilateral CP.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A number of systematic reviews<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> have consistently identified growing evidence for intensive motor learning based approaches to upper limb rehabilitation for children with unilateral CP (eg, constraint-induced movement therapy, Hand Arm Bimanual Intensive Training) to improve upper limb motor performance. Interventions to target lower compared with upper limb motor performance have generally been less intensive. A recent systematic review identified mobility and treadmill training as effective green light, ‘do it’ interventions to improve mobility and gait.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> One model of intervention that integrates both upper and lower limb training was developed for children with unilateral CP. Hand Arm Bimanual Intensive Training Including Lower Extremity training (HABIT-ILE)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> is based on known principles of how to induce neuroplasticity incorporating specific, intensive, repetitive task practice. Studies in basic science with animal models have demonstrated that early intervention based on motor learning principles at critical periods of development reverses the secondary impact of inflammation postbrain injury on neuroplastic processes such as axonal growth, synaptogenesis, myelination and neurogenesis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> To date, two small trials of HABIT-ILE have been conducted, one with school-aged children with unilateral CP (n=24)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and one for those with bilateral CP (n=20).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In children with bilateral CP, aged 6–15 years, there was a strong effect of HABIT-ILE to improve manual ability (1.6 logit increase on the ABILHAND-Kids), gross motor function (seven-point increase on the Gross Motor Function Measure) and self-care (eight-point increase on the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adapted Test (PEDI-CAT)).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A recent systematic review graded HABIT-ILE as a ‘yellow, probably do it’ intervention, as results were promising but require additional research to increase confidence in the estimate of treatment effect.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We are currently conducting a large clinical trial of HABIT-ILE for school-aged children with bilateral CP to confirm and increase certainty in these results.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>To date, there remains a major gap in the current evidence for effective interventions for younger children (2–5 years) with bilateral CP.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Children with CP reach 90% of their gross motor/movement potential by 5 years of age or younger, making the first 5 years of life a vital window of opportunity to maximise function.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, this younger age group is less likely to have secondary complications such as muscle contractures; therefore, the magnitude of outcomes possible could be larger than in older children. The current HABIT-ILE dosing schedule for school-aged children with bilateral CP (6.5 hours/day for 10 days<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> or 6.5 hours for 13 days<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) is not feasible to deliver to younger children. Younger children often continue to require a nap time and are unlikely able to tolerate 6.5 hours per day of therapy without significant fatigue; therefore, a reduced dosing protocol needs to be considered. Content of therapy will differ as games will need to be carefully selected to be age appropriate to engage children and drive self-initiated mobility and bimanual hand use. An adapted dosing schedule and structure of HABIT-ILE needs to be urgently developed and evaluated for this younger age group to capitalise on harnessing use-dependent neuroplasticity and maximising motor function.</p>
              <p>This pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT), Preschool HABIT-ILE, will compare this intensive motor training approach to usual care in preschool-aged children with bilateral CP (2–5 years) at a lower dosing schedule (40 hours) than the original HABIT-ILE studies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 13</xref> This lower dose was selected as it has been shown to be acceptable, feasible and effective with a younger age group children<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and will be augmented with a structured and written home programme<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> to support families to carry out practice within their own context.</p>

                  <p>The intervention will be based on the child’s motor abilities (determined at baseline), age, interests and caregiver-identified functional goals. Tasks/activities will be made incrementally more challenging. Practice will be embedded in play, using part and whole task practice with high repetition including: (1) table top fine motor play-based activities; (2) activities of daily living when sitting/standing/walking; and (3) gross motor play. Lower extremity motor abilities and postural control will be progressed from lying to sitting on the floor and then to sitting on a small bench. Transitions will also be progressed from floor-to-sitting-to-standing.</p>

                  <p>PTs and OTs who have completed standardised training and are experienced in delivering HABIT-ILE with older children will form the supervisory team overseeing delivery of Preschool HABIT-ILE. A speech pathologist will consult with the team if children have specific communication (receptive and/or expressive) or feeding difficulties. For 30 min, at the conclusion of each session, the child’s treating therapy team will meet individually with the child’s parent/caregiver/s (one on one) and discuss the daily programme and make suggestions about activities that could be practised at home. These will be detailed on a written home programme and practice log completed by the caregiver. The home programme activities will be reviewed daily by the child’s treating therapy team in collaboration with the child’s caregiver and updated as appropriate. Parents will be able to take short videos/photos of home practice activities on their smartphone if they wish to serve as a visual reminder for use at home. In addition, a therapist daily activity log will be completed by the therapy team. The therapist daily activity log is a daily record detailing each activity undertaken by the child. It includes the duration and type of activity (types), position (positions) and number of repetitions or successes (for timed tasks) to assess or monitor participant adherence to the intervention. Furthermore, in combination with videotape (detailed below), logs will act as ground-truth for sensor data in order to assess accuracy and validity of activity classification.</p>

                  <p>The control group will receive usual care over the 6-month control period, which will vary from weekly to monthly therapy. We expect that the majority of children will be accessing usual care occupational therapy and physiotherapy at an average of one session per week, funded through the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Intervention approaches will be varied and may include neurodevelopmental therapy, developmental therapy or motor learning-based approaches. Some children may receive alternative ‘intensive’ models of therapy as part of usual care. Families of children in each group will keep a log of usual care therapy including, frequency, duration, mode and content.</p>

One week prior to each assessment time point, two ActiGraphs (one less-affected thigh, one less-affected wrist) will also be worn in the participant’s usual daily life at home (free living) for 7 days during all waking hours at each time point to assess habitual physical activity. During this time, parents will complete a log book to record their child’s activity and position throughout each day. Throughout the 10-day HABIT-ILE intervention, children will wear one ActiGraph GT3X+ on each wrist and on the less-affected thigh, and one Polar OH1 Optical HR Monitor on one upper arm. Data will be processed using count-based methods to objectively quantify change in bimanual performance (asymmetry index) on the BoHA.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The intensity/type of practice during the camp, intensity of free-living habitual physical activity and time spent ambulatory, transitioning and standing (vs sitting and lying) will be determined using machine learning approaches.

              <p>Young children with CP reach 90% of their gross motor/movement potential by 5 years or younger.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Sixty per cent of children with CP have a bilateral presentation of movement difficulties, yet there is limited evidence for effective interventions to improve their gross motor and manual abilities.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Building on a previous small study<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and our current HABIT-ILE Australia project,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> we aim to test the efficacy of an adapted protocol for younger children aged 2–5 years with bilateral CP to improve motor outcomes. One potential limitation of the study is that therapy students under the supervision of trained therapists will be primarily delivering the Preschool HABIT-ILE intervention. As we have done in the larger HABIT-ILE Australia study, we will account for this by providing 1 day of standardised training for all interventionists, daily debriefing meetings at the end of each day and ongoing daily feedback from supervising therapists. Second, the dose being tested (50 hours) was a pragmatic choice based on what is likely to be feasible and acceptable in the Australian context. This dose, however, relies on 10 hours of home practice. We will follow evidence-based processes for the development, delivery and support of parents and caregivers in the implementation of home practice.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Usual care is highly variable and may not be at an equivalent dose as the intended Preschool HABIT-ILE. It is not possible to standardise usual care given it is delivered by many different service providers under pre-agreed funding packages. We will, however, comprehensively record the type and dose of standard care to determine any differences in dosing schedules and content of intervention. Our inclusion of children classified GMFCS II–IV with all motor types aims to ensure that results are generalisable; however, if there is a large differential response to the intervention, the study may be underpowered.</p>
              <p>The study has a number of strengths. The number of participants to be included has been calculated for the primary clinical outcome, and recruitment is feasible. Selected outcome measures have evidence for both validity and reliability in our population of interest. Standardised interventionist training and fidelity monitoring already developed in our HABIT-ILE Australia<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> study will be adapted, in addition to a within trial cost–utility analysis will provide vital information to inform the potential translation of this intervention, particularly in Australia under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is anticipated that results of this RCT will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences.</p>
