                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Sustaining injury is a common consequence of playing sport. At least one in every three recreational athletes with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction do not return to their preinjury sport following treatment. Psychological factors including confidence and fear of new injury exert large effects on returning to sport. The primary aim of this trial is to test whether a custom smartphone application delivering cognitive-behavioural therapy is effective for improving the number of people who return to their preinjury sport and level following ACL reconstruction.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Participants scheduled for primary ACL reconstruction are recruited prior to surgery from one of six trial sites in Sweden. We aim to recruit 222 participants (111 in each group) for the BANG trial. Participants are randomly allocated to receive either usual rehabilitation care alone or usual rehabilitation care plus the Back in the Game smartphone application intervention. Back in the Game is a 24-week Internet-delivered programme, based on cognitive-behavioural therapy. The primary outcome is return to the preinjury sport and level at 12 months follow-up. The secondary outcomes assess physical activity participation, new knee injuries, psychological factors, quality of life and physical function. Physical activity participation and new injuries are self-reported every two weeks for 12 months, then every 4 weeks to 24 months follow-up. Psychological readiness to return to sport, knee self-efficacy, motivation to participate in leisure time physical activity, knee-related quality of life, and self-reported knee function are also assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months after surgery. A clinical assessment of strength, knee range of motion, effusion and hopping performance is completed by a blinded assessor at 12 months to assess physical function.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This protocol outlines how we plan to assess the efficacy of a custom smartphone application, delivering cognitive-behavioural therapy to address fear, confidence and recovery expectations, for improving return to sport following serious sports-related musculoskeletal injury. The BANG trial employs a pragmatic design to best reflect the reality of, and inform, clinical practice.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">Regular participation in sport and active recreation is advocated by the World Health Organization as important for improving global physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. At least one in every three adults do not meet recommendations for the amount of physical activity required for health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Participating in vigorous activities (i.e. sport) may afford greater health benefits than moderate physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the health benefits of participating in organised sport should not be underestimated. The dilemma is, ill-health – sustaining injury – is a common consequence of playing sport.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Based on register data of serious sports and active recreation injuries, at 1 year after injury, one in three people had leisure time physical activity levels that were below the minimum recommended for health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. People who stopped being active were highly active in sport before their injury. It is unclear whether the injury caused the person to quit playing sport. Rehabilitation clinicians often encounter the athlete who has the physical capacity to participate in sport, but is afraid to participate.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Returning to sport is usually the primary concern of athletes following injury. Yet after serious injury, like anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, up to half of athletes do not return to competitive sport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The transition through rehabilitation and back to sport can be difficult for injured athletes as they experience concerns about their ability to perform at the same level as before the injury, and anxiety about sustaining a new injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Adding to the challenge, is that (i) there is no systematic approach to addressing psychological concerns during sports injury rehabilitation, (ii) rehabilitation clinicians often feel ill-equipped to provide effective psychological support, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and (iii) during the time the athletes are returning to sport, they typically lack the support of a rehabilitation clinician, having been discharged from rehabilitation months earlier.</p>
              <p id="Par18">A self-directed, stand-alone intervention, serving as a complement to rehabilitation might be an effective way to overcome some of the barriers to delivering effective psychological support to athletes during, and after, rehabilitation. eHealth technology facilitates low-cost, on-demand delivery of psychological support to injured athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Because smartphones are a ubiquitous part of daily life, they are an attractive platform from which to deliver evidence-based strategies for improving confidence to return to sport that athletes can access anywhere, and at any time – psychological support in the athlete’s pocket.</p>

                <title>Aims and hypothesis</title>
                <p id="Par19">The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to test whether Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy to address confidence for returning to sport (Back in the Game app), is effective for improving the number of people who return to their preinjury sport and level following ACL reconstruction.</p>
                <p id="Par20">The secondary aims are to assess the effect of the Back in the Game app on participation in sport, incidence of new knee injuries, psychological readiness to return to sport, knee self-efficacy, motivation to return to sport, knee-related quality of life, and self-reported knee function.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Our hypothesis is that more patients who use the app in addition to receiving usual rehabilitation care following ACL reconstruction will return to their preinjury sport and level than patients who receive usual care alone.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par22">The BANG trial is a parallel-group, two-arm, superiority trial. Participants with ACL reconstruction will be recruited from one of six clinical sites and randomly allocated (in blocks of 6 with a 1:1 allocation, stratified for site) to receive either usual rehabilitation care alone (control group) or usual rehabilitation care plus the Back in the Game smartphone application (experimental group) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The primary outcome is return to the preinjury sport and level at 12 months after surgery.

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par23">Participants are recruited from three metropolitan private hospitals, one University hospital and three regional public hospitals in southern and western Sweden.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Recruitment process</title>
                <p id="Par24">The clinic co-ordinator at each site completes eligibility screening of patients who have been scheduled by their treating orthopaedic surgeon for ACL reconstruction. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria are provided written information about the trial. Approximately 5 days later, patients are asked if they wish to consent to participate and be contacted by the trial co-ordinator.</p>
                <p id="Par25">The trial co-ordinator contacts participants via email and short message service (SMS) with information about how to download the app and create an account. A second round of consent to participate in the study occurs at this point – participants must complete electronic informed consent before their app account is registered. Recruitment commenced in June 2019 and is anticipated to conclude in December 2020.</p>
                <sec id="Sec6">
                  <title>Recruitment rate and strategies to achieve adequate participant enrolment</title>
                  <p id="Par26">Approximately 4000 ACL reconstructions are performed annually in Sweden; the trial sites perform approximately one third of these surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patients aged between 16 and 30 years comprise approximately 60% of all patients receiving ACL reconstruction in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Based on our previous experience, we expect approximately 20 to 40% of patients to be eligible to participate in the BANG trial (typical clinical population varies at the clinical sites – we expect the metropolitan sites will have a higher proportion of potentially eligible patients). We expect approximately 50% of eligible patients to consent to participate in the trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par27">We aim to recruit 222 participants (111 in each group) for the BANG trial. Recruitment progress at each trial site is formally reviewed every 6 months to judge the likelihood of completing recruitment according to the planned timeline. If recruitment is slower than anticipated, we will consider approaching additional clinical sites to assist with participant recruitment.</p>

We do not provide further description of the intervention prior to participants consenting to participate, to avoid inducing participation. Participants are informed that if they agree to be in the trial, there is a 50–50 chance of receiving more than the usual amount of content about return to sport provided during post-operative rehabilitation.

For each strength and hop test, participants will complete at least 1 familiarisation trial on each leg, until they feel comfortable to perform the test. The number of familiarisation trials is at the discretion of the assessor. Strength tests will always be performed before the hop tests because of the maximal effort nature of the test. Participants will have a minimum 5-min rest between completing the strength tests and commencing the hop tests. All tests are completed with shoes on. If participants are unable to complete any one or more of the strength or hop tests, the assessor will record the result as not attempted and the reason why.</p>
                  <p id="Par77">Each assessor will be trained in standardised measurement of strength and hop performance. Each clinical site has an isokinetic dynamometer for strength testing. Because the strength and hopping tests are performance tests, assessors will provide vigorous feedback to elicit a maximum test result. Each limb is tested separately; the uninjured limb is always tested first. The hop tests are performed with the participant’s hands clasped behind his or her back.</p>
                  <p id="Par78">For the strength tests, the starting position is approximately 110° knee flexion. Participants are instructed to repeatedly straighten and bend their knee as hard and as fast as possible, against the resistance of the dynamometer.</p>
                  <p id="Par79">For the single and triple hop for distance, the instruction is to stand on the test leg, then to hop as far forward as possible, taking off and landing on the same foot, and with a controlled, balanced landing. On landing, the foot must remain in the same place – no additional hops allowed – for up to 3 s. The participant will complete two trials on the uninjured leg and two trials on the injured leg, with a minimum 20 s rest between trials. The longest distance hopped will be recorded for both limbs.</p>
                  <p id="Par80">For the side hop test, the participant stands on the test leg and hops from side-to-side, over two parallel strips of tape placed 40 cm apart, as many times as possible in 30 s. If the foot touches the either strip of tape, the hop is invalid and not counted. Each trial will be videorecorded to assist the assessor to count valid hops. There is a minimum 90 s rest between completing the trial on the uninjured leg and completing the trial on the uninjured leg. Participants complete one trial on each leg. If &gt; 25% of the hops are invalid, the participant will complete a second trial after at least 3 min rest.</p>

Eight patient-partners who had had ACL reconstruction within the preceding 8 weeks were recruited via our clinical contacts in a major metropolitan hospital and a university hospital in Sweden. Patient-partners used the Back in the Game app over a 10-week period and provided feedback (up to 3 times, via semi-structured interview) about the intervention content and delivery, the burden of the intervention, and time required to participate in the trial.

Some injuries, like a minor ankle sprain, might result in minimal time lost from sport – the athlete quickly resumes normal training, and continues to participate as before her injury. Other injuries require an extended period of the sidelines of sport. ACL rupture is one of the most common sports-related knee injuries, and injured athletes regularly spend at least 12 months on the sidelines of their sport. Some athletes may never regain their enjoyment for participating in sport after serious injury; many fear sustaining the injury again if they go back to their sport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For some athletes, serious injury may be the catalyst for retiring from sport.</p>

                <title>A clinically-relevant and applicable intervention</title>
                <p id="Par108">A main concern for newly injured athletes is whether they will return to their previous sports participation. Many do not return, despite return to sport being a key goal early after injury, and a key focus of rehabilitation. The on-demand, smartphone-delivered intervention being studied in the BANG trial reflects a paradigm-shift to rehabilitation that comprehensively addresses the key barriers to athletes’ returning to sport: low confidence and high fear of reinjury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par109">Lack of confidence is a serious barrier to otherwise healthy, young athletes reaching their return to sport goal after ACL injury. Structured psychological support may be beneficial, yet most athletes do not access sport psychology for varied reasons that may include cost, stigma and geographic remoteness. The self-guided, on-demand delivery mode of the Back in the Game app is discreet, no cost to users, and available to access at a time that fits with the user’s needs and lifestyle.</p>

                <title>Issues related to participant recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par110">The eligibility criteria are carefully constructed to recruit non-professional athletes with serious knee injury who wish to return to physically demanding sports, to maximise the external validity of the trial. BANG trial recruitment centres perform at least one-third of all ACL reconstructions performed annually in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patients are recruited at the point of care, which means we recruit people in the usual care environment who present to the orthopaedic clinic, have the condition of interest, and have presented on their own behalf without any overt effort to recruit the person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par111">Because our inclusion criteria are stringent, we anticipate recruitment could be slow. Over half of all ACL reconstructions performed annually in Sweden are in patients aged between 16 and 30 years. The treatment algorithm in Sweden is for ACL reconstruction surgery to be recommended to young patients who wish to return to pivoting sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The Data Management Committee (DMC) will have access to participant recruitment information (including recruitment rates at each clinical site). It is within the DMC’s charter to review recruitment and make recommendations to modify recruitment should the DMC deem it necessary.</p>

                <title>Issues related to participant blinding</title>
                <p id="Par112">Maintaining participant blinding to the intervention is difficult in this trial. We have approached this challenge in two ways to try to minimise the risk of detection bias: (1) the smartphone application platform is used to deliver the Back in the Game app (Internet-delivered intervention) <italic>and</italic> for outcome measurement – the platform home screen and functions look the same to all participants, and (2) we inform participants that depending on their group allocation, they will receive the same amount of content as usual for people with ACL reconstruction or more content than usual for people with ACL reconstruction. Despite these approaches, we cannot assume that all participants will remain blind to group allocation for the duration of the trial.</p>

              <sec id="Sec42">
                <title>Issues related to pragmatic trial design</title>
                <p id="Par113">The BANG trial employs a pragmatic design that reflects the reality of and can inform clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. All participants will receive usual rehabilitation care following their ACL reconstruction – the Internet-delivered intervention is delivered <italic>in addition</italic> to usual rehabilitation care. Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction is based on well-established clinical practice guidelines, we expect the goals of rehabilitation to be based on similar principles and structured in similar ways, and the outcomes of the rehabilitation provided to be relatively consistent across the recruitment sites.</p>
                <p id="Par114">Rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction typically continues for at least 6 months, and is tailored to the individual’s sports participation goals and function requirements. Because of the length of rehabilitation required before the athlete is physically and mentally ready to return to sport, and the requirement for tailoring, it is unreasonable to prescribe a standard rehabilitation protocol. A standardised rehabilitation programme would also require substantial resources to implement and render the trial infeasible.</p>

              <sec id="Sec43">
                <title>Issues related to adverse events</title>
                <p id="Par115">The most serious short-term negative consequence after ACL reconstruction and return to sport, is another serious knee injury (ligament rupture or meniscus tear). Sports exposure is the strongest risk factor for new knee injury; 1 in 5 young athletes who returned to sports after ACL reconstruction sustained a second ACL injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Given the Back in the Game app is designed to improve the return to sport rate after ACL reconstruction – a key patient-important outcome after surgery – there is a possible risk of paradoxical harm. It is within the DMC’s purview to examine adverse events, including new knee injuries, and make recommendations to protect the safety of participants.</p>
