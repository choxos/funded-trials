                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Despite higher incidence of brain injury among Aboriginal compared with non-Aboriginal Australians, suboptimal engagement exists between rehabilitation services and Aboriginal brain injury survivors. Aboriginal patients often feel culturally insecure in hospital and navigation of services post discharge is complex. Health professionals report feeling ill-equipped working with Aboriginal patients. This study will test the impact of a research-informed culturally secure intervention model for Aboriginal people with brain injury.</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Recruitment:</italic> Aboriginal participants aged ≥18 years within 4 weeks of an acute stroke or traumatic brain injury.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population (hereafter respectfully referred to as Aboriginal), Australia’s First Nations peoples, constitutes 3.3% of the Australian population<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and consists of many different cultural groups, with more than 120 separate Aboriginal languages spoken (240 at the time of colonisation).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Aboriginal Australians are overall younger than other Australians (median age 23 vs 38 years),<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with health inequities well-documented.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The incidence of brain injury is significantly greater in Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal Australians, with stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurring up to three times more frequently<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–8</xref> and functional dependence at hospital discharge three times more likely.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Motor, communication, sensory and cognitive deficits all adversely affect long-term quality of life, including employment status and prospects, family relationships, social participation and mental health.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref> Ongoing engagement between Aboriginal brain injury survivors and mainstream hospital-based rehabilitation services is limited, with complex service pathways to navigate post discharge.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> This results in confusion, communication breakdown and lack of support for brain injury survivors, their families and communities. Poor service leads to ongoing challenges and re-hospitalisations that incur additional health system costs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref></p>
                <p>Despite some recent improvements in access to acute services such as stroke units and thrombolysis,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> multiple issues persist among those requiring subsequent care: lack of practical, understandable information regarding brain injury; limited availability of Aboriginal Liaison Officers to assist with navigating services; lack of interpreter services; racist attitudes/assumptions of some healthcare providers; and underservicing of rural and remote areas.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 18–21</xref> Many health professionals feel underprepared to work with Aboriginal patients in a culturally secure manner<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> and few people consult Aboriginal Health Services specifically for brain injury-related concerns.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
                <p>The current trial will test the impact of a research-informed <italic toggle="yes">culturally secure</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> intervention model for Aboriginal people with brain injury in Western Australia (WA) (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Cultural security refers to ensuring that Aboriginal cultural values, world views and ways of working are incorporated at each stage of care for an Aboriginal person and that services will not compromise the legitimate cultural rights, values and expectations of Aboriginal people.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The trial addresses the systemic challenges identified in our research, using existing resources where possible and developing a site and service-specific sustainable evidence-based approach. Due to the chronic consequences of brain injury, the proposed intervention package follows a Chronic Care Model (CCM),<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> demonstrated to be successful in the management of other chronic conditions. The CCM has been modified for the purpose of this trial to incorporate specific components related to brain injury. The study will occur in partnership with state government-funded health services and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services, as well as national policymakers.</p>

                <p>A stepped-wedge cluster design was chosen given: (1) the population under focus is under-represented in rehabilitation services, is vulnerable in terms of comorbidities and has poorer overall health outcomes. Withholding an additional service intervention likely to do more good than harm at particular sites within a trial would pose an ethical dilemma; (2) the design still includes a control condition, making comparisons of intervention effectiveness possible; (3) the sequential introduction of the intervention to clusters facilitates the assessment of changes in service standards through secular trends over time; (4) a concurrent roll-out of the intervention across a large geographical area (975 685 square miles), encompassing rural and remote areas, was not feasible.</p>

                <p>The aims of this trial are to: (1) improve delivery of rehabilitation services to Aboriginal people post brain injury (stroke and traumatic brain injury), (2) improve overall health outcomes of this group, (3) conduct an economic evaluation to support the business case for resourcing future rehabilitation services if the intervention is determined to be cost-effective and (4) explore the acceptability of the intervention from the perspectives of health professionals and Aboriginal participants involved, and to use this information to assist in interpretation and translation of findings.</p>
                <p>Our primary hypothesis is that compared with usual care (UC), implementation of the proposed intervention package (IP) will result in at least a 15-point higher score on the EuroQOL-5D-3L<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> (European Quality of Life scale, comprised of five dimensions: Mobility, Self-care, Usual activity, Pain and discomfort, Anxiety and depression; and 3 severity levels) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at 26 weeks post injury.

                <p>As noted above, a stepped-wedge CRCT design<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> will be used, with paired healthcare sites functioning as clusters (see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The pairing was done to prevent contamination between sites since it is common for patients to be transferred between the rural and metropolitan sites that are paired together. The pairing also enables adjustment for differences in numbers of participants recruited in the rural/metropolitan site pairs. Twenty-six weeks of baseline control data will be obtained prior to implementation of the intervention, which will be introduced sequentially to all sites at 26-week intervals. Control data will continue to be collected at each site until the intervention commences. The intervention will continue until all sites have received the intervention for at least 52 weeks. The sequence of receipt of intervention will be determined by randomisation of clusters.</p>

                <p>Clusters will be randomised at the beginning of the trial to determine the sequencing of the introduction of the intervention. Numbers of participants recruited in metropolitan sites are anticipated to be higher than in regional sites due to potential transfer of patients to tertiary metropolitan hospitals for early treatment post stroke/TBI. To minimise potential differences in participant numbers across steps, one metropolitan and one regional site will be paired prior to randomisation, then these pairs of sites will be randomised. The pairings were primarily determined by existing stroke pathways between rural and metropolitan regions. Intervention commencement time will be assigned through use of a computer-generated sequence of random numbers. The process will allocate sites to one of four commencement periods (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>All Aboriginal stroke and patients with TBI ≥18 years of age admitted to hospital will be screened for study inclusion as per eligibility criteria. Those meeting criteria will be approached to participate by the hospital investigator, preferably with the assistance of a hospital-based Aboriginal Liaison Officer. If the person agrees to provision of their name to the trial team, a team member will discuss the trial further with the person and obtain informed consent, involving an interpreter as needed. ‘Aphasia friendly’ information will be used to accommodate patients with communication disorders, cognitive issues and/or limited literacy. For patients with very severe impairment, we will seek assent from the patient as well as proxy consent for research involvement from a person responsible (family member, friend, long-term carer or guardian) for the participant. Consent to participate in the CST will be obtained from all hospital staff completing the training. The same process will occur regardless of control/intervention phase of the trial.</p>

Therefore, it is not possible to blind all the assessors, patients or most investigators with respect to whether the patients received intervention or not. Follow-up assessors will be blinded to the baseline assessment of any given participant.</p>
