                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>To assess if a multi-strategy intervention effectively increased weekly minutes of structured physical activity (PA) implemented by classroom teachers at 12 months and 18 months.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A cluster randomised controlled trial with 61 primary schools in New South Wales Australia. The 12-month multi-strategy intervention included; centralised technical assistance, ongoing consultation, principal’s mandated change, identifying and preparing school champions, development of implementation plans, educational outreach visits and provision of educational materials. Control schools received usual support (guidelines for policy development via education department website and telephone support). Weekly minutes of structured PA implemented by classroom teachers (primary outcome) was measured via teacher completion of a daily log-book at baseline (October–December 2017), 12-month (October–December 2018) and 18-month (April–June 2019). Data were analysed using linear mixed effects regression models.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall, 400 class teachers at baseline, 403 at 12 months follow-up and 391 at 18 months follow-up provided valid primary outcome data. From baseline to 12-month follow-up, teachers at intervention schools recorded a greater increase in weekly minutes of PA implemented than teachers assigned to the control schools by approximately 44.2 min (95% CI 32.8 to 55.7; p&lt;0.001) which remained at 18 months, however, the effect size was smaller at 27.1 min (95% CI 15.5 to 38.6; p≤0.001).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>A multi-strategy intervention increased mandatory PA policy implementation. Some, but not all of this improvement was maintained after implementation support concluded. Further research should assess the impact of scale-up strategies on the sustainability of PA policy implementation over longer time periods.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>To improve child physical activity (PA) levels, the WHO recommended schools adopt policies that support children’s daily PA.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Interventions that increase opportunities for regular PA during the school day effectively increased children’s moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In addition to teaching physical education (PE), a number of countries including Australia,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> China,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Denmark,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> England<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and several Canadian provinces<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and US states<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> have policies or guidelines regarding the minimum amount of time that primary schools schedule structured PA each week. Despite their existence, most schools fail to implement such policies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> For example, in a study of Canadian elementary school teachers, only 43% implemented the mandatory 30 min/day PA policy that required organised in-class opportunities for children to be active.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> An Australian study (2017) found that only 24% were meeting the recommended 150 min of weekly PA.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> To enhance the potential to achieve broad public health benefits, school PA policies and strategies are needed to assist schools overcome barriers to their implementation and scale-up. We also need to identify whether schools’ continue to implement policies (implementation maintenance) once support is removed, as this encourages implementation in the first place and maximises benefits at scale-up.</p>
              <p>There is limited research of strategies that facilitate schools’ implementation of health innovations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A Cochrane review<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> identified only one controlled trial in primary schools that aimed to implement PA guidelines.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This quasi-experimental study in seven US schools provided: on-site training, ongoing technical assistance, modelling, audit and feedback, resources and coalition building support.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Improvements in the implementation of PE congruent with national guidelines were found, but effects were not sustained at 2 years. In 2017, we undertook a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) in 12 Catholic primary schools. We aimed to determine the efficacy of a 9-month strategy to improve teachers’ implementation of the New South Wales (NSW) <italic toggle="yes">Sport and Physical Activity Policy</italic>, which requires schools to schedule 150 min of moderate, with some vigorous, PA per week for students in kindergarten to grade 10.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The 150 min may include: PE (which in Australia is typically taught by generalist classroom teachers), sport and other structured activities such as energisers<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (ie, 3–5 min structured classroom PA breaks) or active lessons (eg, integrating PA into maths lessons).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Intervention schools received: executive support, training for in-school champions, ongoing support, tools and resources.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Immediately following the intervention, teachers in intervention schools scheduled significantly more minutes of PA per week than teachers in control schools (36.6 min, 95% CI 2.7 to 70.5, p=0.04).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The extent to which these effects were maintained following cessation of implementation support or factors important for interpreting implementation findings (eg, a description of implementation context and processes) were not assessed.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of this study was to assess whether a multi-strategy intervention effectively increased weekly minutes of structured PA implemented by classroom teachers at 12 months and 18 months. Our secondary objective was to describe the types of activities teachers implemented to achieve PA policy adherence (eg, PE, energisers, sport and integrated lessons).</p>

The inclusion of this contingency planning was an adaptation from the pilot study where it had been identified that if teachers had physical activity scheduled but unexpected events occurred in the school, for example, special assemblies or wet weather they did not adapt their schedule for the day to include the physical activity elsewhere. The training was accredited by the state educational authority and provides time towards teachers continuing professional development hours.</td>

                <p>Analyses of the study outcomes were performed under an intention to treat framework, with teacher responses analysed according to the experimental group their school was originally randomised to. Class (nested within a school) was the unit of analysis. Differences between the intervention and control group with regards to changes in the primary outcome and types of PA implemented (ie, PE, energisers, sport and integrated lessons) from baseline to each of the follow-up time-points, were assessed using linear mixed effects regression models. Linear mixed models estimate and account for the correlation of data within clusters (ie, schools) through the inclusion of random effects, thus accounting for the lack of independence of observations from cluster trials such as this one. Linear mixed models also use all available data, regardless of missing outcome data, assuming data are missing at random. A separate model was conducted for each outcome, and included fixed effects for treatment group (intervention vs control), time (baseline, 12-month and 18-month follow-up), a time by group interaction term and variables prognostic of the outcome (school type, geographic and socioeconomic location of the school).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The model included a random intercept for school to allow for the clustered design, a random intercept for teacher (nested within school) to account for repeated measurement of some teachers, as well as a random slope. Descriptive statistics described the process measures reported by the intervention group.</p>

                <p><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> presents a flowchart of the eligible and participating schools in the study. Four hundred and thirty-two schools were assessed for eligibility, with 62 schools meeting inclusion criteria and consenting to participate. One school was excluded prior to randomisation because it was participating in another PA intervention. There were no differences in the baseline characteristics of schools (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>), with 42% of schools from intervention and 39% of control groups from inner/outer regional areas and 58% from major cities (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Overall, 44% of schools from major city areas were classified as most disadvantaged, compared with 88% of schools from inner/outer regional areas. School size (data not shown) ranged from 40 to 900 students, with the mean size slightly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (300.3 vs 261.6, respectively). Of the remaining 61 schools, 3 provided invalid data (ie, no surveys with 5 days of data ≤250 min), leaving a total of 58 schools contributing valid data at 12-month and 18-month follow-up, from a total of 403 and 391 teachers, respectively. Across all three time points loss of data due to reporting of PA above 250 min represented a 4% loss of data. The characteristics of all teachers providing valid data across each of the three time points was similar across both intervention and control groups (see <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>At 12-month intervention teachers increased their overall implementation of PA per week by an average of 44.2 min (95% CI 32.8 to 55.7; p&lt;0.001) more than the control group (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). This was maintained at 18 months, with the intervention group increasing their implementation from baseline to 18 months by an average of 27.1 min (95% CI 15.5 to 38.6; p≤0.001) more than the control. The difference in the change from 12-month to 18-month follow-up between the two experimental groups was statistically significant (−17.2 min (95% CI –28.8 to –5.64; p=0.004)), with the intervention group recording a within group change of - 1.3 min (95% CI −9.3 to 6.6; p=0.74), compared with the usual care group which recorded an increase of 15.9 min (95% CI 7.4 to 24.3; p&lt;0.001).</p>

                <title>Why this study is important?</title>
                <p>This is one of few implementation trials internationally to examine the impact of strategies to improve the implementation of school PA policies and is the largest to do so. The study used a comprehensive evaluation framework to report the effects of an implementation strategy that was developed using a theoretically guided process, undertaken in partnership with end-users and drew on considerable formative research. The study found that the strategy was effective in improving initial policy implementation, and that such improvements were maintained in part, at longer term follow-up. The findings have important implications for policy makers and practitioners interested in improving student PA in this setting.</p>

                <title>How effective was the intervention?</title>
                <p>The size of the intervention effect (47 min) on the mean minutes of PA implemented was larger than a quasi-experimental study by Cradock <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> in the USA (18 min) and a randomised trial by Naylor <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>

BC (AS!BC) in Canada (10 min) that also sought to support schools implementation of a 150 min MVPA policy through scheduling PE, recess and integrated classroom PA. The absolute change in minutes scheduled by the intervention groups in these studies was, however, comparable (44.2 min vs 46.5 min vs 55.2 min/week). All three studies used similar implementation strategies, including: to identify and train school champions, provide equipment and curricular materials. Similar to others<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> we trained generalist classroom teachers to deliver PA, as compared with other studies that trained PE teachers and school staff wellness champions to implement the policy.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Given the well-documented barriers generalist classroom teachers report in implementing PA<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> these findings are promising given the potential population reach classroom teachers have.</p>

                <title>Characterising the effect of the intervention</title>
                <p>The intervention effectively increased teacher’s willingness to deliver energiser breaks. Teacher’s initial and sustained implementation of energisers contributed to 52% and 85% of the intervention effect at 12 and 18 months, respectively. This is consistent with both AS!BC<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and a 3-year RCT which aimed to increase the adoption of energisers by classroom teachers as part of the US CATCH programme.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Undertaken in 30 Texas middle-schools the study found at the end of year 1 approximately 40% of teachers had implemented energisers which increased to approximately 48% of teachers by the end of year 2. These findings and ours suggest that energisers are acceptable, and possibly sustainable, PA strategies for teachers. This may be because energisers are characteristically short, easily embedded within or between lessons and require minimal to no equipment. However, evidence from our studies<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and others<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> suggest that despite their simplicity, teachers still require some support to implement energisers. While similar implementation strategies were employed in both CATCH and our study, the intensity of ongoing support and the resources provided to teachers differed. Compared with CATCH, which provided printed resources to teachers, we promoted teacher’s use of existing online energisers. In doing so we helped teachers overcome barriers related to confidence and competence to deliver PA.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In turn, this may reduce the need for ongoing intensive implementation support to upskill teachers, thereby potentially providing a more cost-effective, scalable and sustainable intervention.</p>

                <title>Maintaining intervention effects</title>
                <p>In contrast, our findings suggest that once implementation support ended, the intervention was not effective at maintaining the modest improvements in teachers’ implementation of PE (despite this being a mandatory subject) and integrated lessons. While there is limited empirical evidence, sustainability frameworks suggest that organisational factors such as funding and leadership support, staff turnover, training and programme fit, are associated with the continued delivery of health programmes in schools.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> To ensure that such interventions are resilient to attenuation over time, prior to withdrawing implementation support, future studies may consider supporting schools to: identify ongoing funding sources, establish processes that enable the handover of programme knowledge to new staff and develop plans for how the programme may be able to adapt overtime while still retaining core components.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This is the largest cluster RCT to assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategy implementation intervention on schools implementation of a PA policy. We specifically selected implementation strategies and behaviour change techniques that addressed known barriers and were mapped against a robust theoretical framework. We assessed implementation processes and conducted a follow-up which is rarely done in school-based studies. Our study also had a number of limitations. The primary outcome relied on self-report via a log-book, a method selected on the basis of use in previous trials<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 32 36</xref> analogous evidence suggests such measures may represent a valid measure of implementation in this setting, and the pragmatics of undertaking research at such a large scale. However, such measures are at risk of social desirability and recall bias which likely lead to overestimates in the reported. Nonetheless, the use of more objective measures, that capture the fidelity to which strategies were implemented, may improve the internal validity of the trial and its findings. In addition, increasing the frequency that such data is collected throughout the study period could identify any seasonal impact on scheduling. Further, increased scheduling of PA does not guarantee that increased activity is delivered, delivered to a standard that increases students MVPA or that all students participate. For example, in our pilot study, despite an increase of 36 min in teachers weekly scheduling of PA, we saw only an approximately increase of 15 min in student weekly MVPA. The implementation strategy was developed using a theoretically guided process and drawing on considerable formative evaluation undertaken in the setting. However, the process may not have considered in sufficient detail the extent to which characteristics of schools may interact with core components of implementation intervention components and other contextual factors to enhance or impede implementation success. A more nuanced strategy development process articulating, and then assessing and reporting these interactions may have provided useful insights to guide future implementation efforts. Finally, a deeper understanding of what helped drive the intervention effect could have been explored more rigorously through a comprehensive approach such as that recommended by McKay <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>School PA interventions must be effectively implemented at scale if we are to achieve public health benefit.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, a recent systematic review reported that scaled-up PA interventions lose up to 60% of their prescale effect.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> A primary impediment to the successful implementation at scale is the selection of interventions that are not amenable to scale-up. This trial exceeded the intervention effect from the pilot study suggesting that both the PA practices and the implementation intervention is amenable to scale. However, future studies are needed to determine the minimal intervention ‘dose’ required to sustain schools delivery of all intervention components and the cost to do so.</p>
