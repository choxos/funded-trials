                  <p id="Par1">Clinical guidelines recommend exercise as a core treatment for individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the best type of exercise for clinical benefits is not clear, particularly in different OA subgroups. Obesity is a common co-morbidity in people with knee OA. There is some evidence suggesting that non-weight bearing exercise may be more effective than weight bearing exercise in patients with medial knee OA and obesity.</p>

Participants will be randomly allocated to undertake a program of either weight bearing functional exercise or non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening exercise. Both groups will attend five individual sessions with a physiotherapist who will teach, monitor and progress the exercise program. Participants will be asked to perform the exercises at home four times per week for 12 weeks. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks. Primary outcomes are self-reported knee pain and physical function. Secondary outcomes include other measures of knee pain, physical function, quality-of-life, participant-perceived global change, physical performance, and lower limb muscle strength.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par19">Knee osteoarthritis (OA), predominantly affecting the medial tibiofemoral compartment, is a major public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pain is a dominant characteristic, becoming persistent and more limiting as the disease progresses, resulting in reduced physical function and quality-of-life and often, costly joint replacement surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Obesity is a common co-morbidity in individuals with knee OA and is an established risk factor for disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. With the significant personal, social and economic burden of OA well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], targeted effective conservative treatments for people at high risk of disease progression, such as those with concomitant obesity, are needed to reduce this burden.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Exercise therapy relieves knee pain at all stages of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although similar in magnitude to common drug treatments, effect sizes for exercise are modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This may be because randomised controlled trials (RCT) have generally used a “one-size-fits-all” approach to exercise prescription, and have not tailored exercise according to clinical presentation, resulting in attenuation of treatment effects. Our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] provides preliminary evidence supporting this premise. We compared two different types of exercise programs, weight bearing neuromuscular and non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening, in individuals with medial knee OA. Modest improvements in pain with both programs were not significantly different between the two. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses showed that people with obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) had different pain relieving responses from the two exercise programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Specifically, a greater benefit for pain was found with a non-weight bearing quadriceps exercise program than with a weight bearing program. These hypothesis-generating findings suggest that individuals with medial knee OA and obesity may require specific types of exercise in order to maximise outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The mechanism(s) underpinning a potential greater benefit from non-weight bearing exercise than with weight bearing exercise in this OA patient subgroup is not clear. One possible biomechanical mechanism may be attributed to the greater load placed on the knee joint in individuals with a higher body mass index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. During weight bearing activities such as walking, climbing stairs, getting in and out of a chair forces through the knee can be 2–3 times body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, the higher a person’s weight the greater the load placed on the knee joints during weight bearing activities. High rates of pain catastrophising, fear avoidance and kinesiophobia in obese individuals has also been documented and may provide another plausible link between higher reported musculoskeletal symptom severity and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We speculate that individuals with painful knee OA and obesity might respond better in terms of pain and function when completing a non-weight bearing (lower knee load), less psychologically threatening form of exercise for their knee OA than a more complex and physically demanding weight bearing program.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The primary aim of this RCT is to directly compare the effects of two different home-based exercise programs, non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening and weight bearing functional exercise on pain and physical function for individuals with medial compartment knee OA and obesity. We hypothesise that participants who undertake non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening will have greater improvements in pain and function than those who undertake weight bearing exercise at 12 weeks. Our secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of the two different exercise programs on a range of other outcomes such as other measures of pain, function, health-related quality-of-life, global change, muscle strength and physical performance.</p>

                <p id="Par43">Volunteers will undergo screening via an online survey, followed by telephone screening, to ensure eligibility. Potentially suitable volunteers will then be invited to undergo radiographic screening. If participants have a suitable weight bearing knee x-ray from the past 12 months, this can be used for screening. If participants do not have a suitable recent x-ray, they will be invited to have a new knee x-ray taken.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Baseline and follow-up assessments (completed at the Department of Physiotherapy in the University of Melbourne) will be conducted by the same assessor blinded to exercise group allocation. Participants will visit a physiotherapist five times over the 12-week intervention. Only one knee will be the focus of treatment and evaluation. For participants with bilateral symptoms, the most symptomatic eligible knee, will be nominated. In cases where bilateral knees are equally symptomatic, the right knee will be nominated. Participants will be advised to continue with their usual medication during the trial. Regular study newsletters and Christmas cards will be sent to help with participant retention. Ethical approval has been obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne (HREC No. 1544919) and all participants will provide written informed consent.</p>

                <p id="Par46">Randomisation will occur according to a 1: 1 allocation ratio and be stratified by combination of study physiotherapist and their physiotherapy clinic (two physiotherapists worked at two separate clinics each). On completion of baseline assessment at The University of Melbourne, participants will be randomly allocated into one of the two interventions groups: i) non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening exercise program (NWBE); or ii) weight bearing functional exercise program (WBE).</p>
                <p id="Par47">The randomisation schedule will be computer generated, using random permuted blocks of sizes 6 to 12, by a person not involved in recruitment of participants. The randomisation schedule will only be accessed via a password-protected computer program.

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par51">Seven physiotherapists in seven private practices at various locations throughout Melbourne, Australia will deliver both interventions. The physiotherapists have an average of 15.1 (range 6–28) years of clinical experience since qualification and 10.6 (range 3–23) years of post-graduate clinical musculoskeletal experience. Six (85%) have formal postgraduate Masters qualifications in sports or manipulative/musculoskeletal therapy. All physiotherapists will attend a 4-h training session and be provided with a treatment manual describing the interventions. Regular telephone meetings will be conducted with the physiotherapists to reinforce the protocol and discuss any study issues. This will help to ensure similar treatment administration among the therapists. Weights and elastic bands will be provided to the physiotherapist to give to the study participants.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Participants in both groups will visit a physiotherapist for an individual session five times over 12 weeks (approximately study weeks 1, 2, 4, 7 and 10). Each session will last 30–40 min. In our previous study, participants visited the physiotherapist on 14 occasions over 12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However we reduced this to five sessions in the current study for several reasons. First, informal feedback from participants was that the number of sessions was excessive. Second, our other exercise studies in patients with knee OA have shown comparable adherence with fewer sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Third, five sessions is a more realistic number to generalise to real life clinical practice. The physiotherapist will teach the participant an exercise program which they will be asked to perform at home four times per week. At the scheduled sessions, the physiotherapist will conduct a brief reassessment to determine progress and any adverse effects and will watch the participant complete the program in order to review and correct quality and form of exercise performance. Findings will help determine physiotherapists’ decision-making regarding progression or modification of the exercises. Participants will be asked to record their exercise completions in a log book. The physiotherapists will check the participants’ log book and set goals/targets to help maintain adherence and motivation. Both groups will also receive a one-page sheet providing information about OA.</p>

                  <title>Non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening exercise program (NWBE)</title>
                  <p id="Par53">The aim of the non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening exercise program (NWBE) is to improve the strength of the quadriceps. The program consists of exercises performed in sitting or supine where the participant is not bearing their body weight through the affected lower limb (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and is based on those used in our previous RCT’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par54">Participants will be provided with adjustable ankle cuff weights (0.65 kg to 10 kg) and elastic resistance bands. They will commence the program with two sets of ten repetitions for each exercise for the first 2 weeks and progress to three sets thereafter or as quickly as able. The starting weight will be the participant’s 10-repetition maximum weight or determined by the participant’s level of effort aiming for between 5 and 8 out of 10 (hard to very hard) on the modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion CR-10 scale for strength training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Participants will be instructed that each exercise should be performed slowly in a controlled manner. Progression will be guided by the physiotherapist at regular intervals with adjustments to participants’ ankle weights or elastic resistance bands. Participants will also be encouraged to increase the weights (0.5 kg at a time) for each exercise if they feel the exercise is ‘easier to complete’ compared to the beginning of that week. The end position of each exercise is to be held initially for 5 s and then increased to 10 s.</p>
                  <p id="Par55">Participants will be advised that the exercises should be performed within a tolerable level of pain. Some discomfort is expected, but by the next day pain should subside to usual levels with no increase in knee swelling following the exercise session. If the physiotherapist feels that a particular exercise is exacerbating the participant’s pain, then the physiotherapist may reduce the resistance, dosage and/or level of exercise until the pain aggravation settles. If joint swelling or increased pain lasting more than 1 day occurs, the program should be modified by reducing the intensity, frequency and/or number of repetitions by half. If pain or swelling is excessive and the therapist deems it appropriate, the exercise program can be ceased for a period of time.</p>

                  <title>Weight bearing functional exercise program (WBE)</title>
                  <p id="Par56">This program incorporates neuromuscular exercises. The aim is to functionally strengthen the lower limb muscles, improve trunk/lower limb joint alignment and quality of movement performance. The exercises are based on those used in our previous RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The five exercises and their progressions are described in detail in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Participants will be provided with an adjustable step (10 cm to 15 cm height), foam mat, and elastic resistance bands.</p>
                  <p id="Par57">A major emphasis is on the quality of performance of each exercise. Participants will be instructed to maintain alignment of the pelvis and trunk in the frontal plane (avoid pelvic drop and trunk lateral flexion) and to neutrally align their knee (position the knee over the foot as much as possible) throughout the movements. Knee flexion should not exceed 30° (except when performing the chair stand exercise) to reduce the risk of increasing knee pain. Having hand support within easy reach or using hand support is important for maintaining balance and quality of performance throughout the movements. Exercise progression is essential and is determined by the physiotherapist, based on a combination of the participant’s pain and rating of perceived exertion score for each exercise (at least 5 out of 10 on a modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion CR-10 scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) and the physiotherapist’s assessment of the quality of the exercise performance. Exercises should be performed within a tolerable level of pain as per the method outlined for the non-weight bearing exercise program. Progressions will occur by increasing resistance, changing stance surface, and/or varying the repetitions, direction, and speed of movements. Some participants may not reach the final level of each exercise depending on their rate of progression.</p>

Demographic and baseline characteristics of participants will be summarised as appropriate (means and standard deviations for continuous variables that appear to be approximately normally distributed, medians and interquartile ranges for other continuous variables, counts and percentages for categorical variables) and will be inspected to assess baseline comparability of treatment groups. For continuous outcomes, differences in change will be compared between groups using linear regression models, adjusted for baseline levels of these outcomes, including random effects for treating physiotherapist to account for clustering by physiotherapist. Model assumptions will be assessed using standard diagnostic plots. For binary outcomes, differences between groups will be compared using relative risks, calculated from logistic regression models with random effects for treating physiotherapist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Should the amount of missing data for an outcome be such that imputation is required, multiple imputation will be conducted and the method reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>

Specifically, it will either prove or disprove the hypothesis that greater benefits will be found with non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening exercise than with weight bearing functional exercise when applied to this group. The study will help inform exercise prescription recommendations for people with medial knee OA and obesity.</p>
