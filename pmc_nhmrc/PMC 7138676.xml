                  <p>This study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial utilizing a Type-3 Hybrid implementation-effectiveness design conducted between October 2016 and March 2018. This study reports on child outcomes. Fifty-four childcare centers in New South Wales, Australia were randomly assigned to the intervention (a web-based menu-planning tool and support) or control group (usual care). The intervention was designed to address barriers and enablers to dietary guideline implementation according to the Theoretical Domains Framework. A quota of 35 consenting childcare centers undertook child-level evaluation of dietary intake where 522 parents consented to completing ≥1 component of data collection for their child. Child consumption of core and discretionary (unhealthy) foods while in care was assessed via dietary observations by blinded research assistants, childcare diet quality was assessed via educator-completed questionnaires, BMI <italic>z</italic> scores were assessed via measured weight and height, and child HRQoL was assessed via parent report at baseline and 12-mo follow-up.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In 2016 the WHO estimated that ∼41 million young children aged &lt;5 y were overweight and obese (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Children who are overweight or obese are more likely to be overweight as adults (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), increasing their lifetime risk of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and some cancers (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). As such, the WHO has called for urgent action to reduce the primary modifiable risk factors for excessive weight gain including poor diet (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Early childhood is a critical period for developing healthy eating behaviors, with food preferences established in childhood tracking into later life (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>). However, &gt;90% of preschool-aged children in Australia and the United States do not consume their recommended servings of vegetables, and almost all consume excessive amounts of unhealthy foods (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
              <p>Childcare centers are an important setting for the delivery of population-wide nutrition initiatives because they provide broad reach to young children (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Leading health organizations (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and governments, internationally (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and in Australia (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), recommend that childcare centers provide foods consistent with national dietary guidelines to promote healthy eating.</p>
              <p>Although systematic reviews suggest that increasing the availability of healthy foods in childcare centers may improve child diet (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), there have been few rigorous evaluations of food service–based interventions that target the implementation of sector-specific dietary guidelines on childcare menus. A Cochrane systematic review in 2016 identified just 1 quasi-experimental trial that assessed the impact of a food service–based intervention, which included face-to-face training of cooks and monthly site visits by dietitians in 9 Head Start centers, on reducing the saturated fat content of meals consistent with the US Dietary Guidelines (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Evaluation with 1296 children found significant reductions in child consumption of energy from saturated fat from meals consumed in childcare at 1-y follow-up, as assessed via direct observations (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted by the research team since publication of the review (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) used a multicomponent 6-mo food-service intervention targeting cooks, which included provision of training and resources, audit and feedback, face-to-face or telephone support by dietitians, and securing executive support from childcare managers. The study reported significant improvements in fruit (<italic>P</italic> = 0.014) and vegetable (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) consumption measured via aggregate plate waste measures with 45 centers. Such findings suggest that food service–based interventions which include provision of training and ongoing support to childcare cooks may be effective in increasing provision of healthier foods and improving child diet. These interventions, however, have utilized resource-intensive, face-to-face approaches delivered by specialist staff, which are likely to have limited reach (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Effective interventions in this setting need to be amenable to delivery at scale to produce meaningful improvements to child health (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
              <p>As such, this study aims to examine the impact of an implementation intervention consisting primarily of a web-based menu-planning tool, with support targeting cooks to improve the provision of foods in childcare centers in accordance with dietary guidelines, on <italic>1</italic>) child dietary intake in care (servings of core food groups and discretionary foods); <italic>2</italic>) child diet quality score in care; <italic>3</italic>) child BMI <italic>z</italic> scores; and <italic>4</italic>) child health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The web-based method was selected to overcome the reach limitations of previous interventions in this setting and provide an opportunity for scaling up at a population level.</p>

              <p>Ethical approval was obtained from Hunter New England (16/02/17/4.05) and the University of Newcastle (H-2016-0111) Human Research Ethics Committees. Owing to the number of preregistered outcomes, the primary outcome (implementation of guidelines) has been reported in a separate publication. Briefly, there were no significant differences between intervention and control centers in terms of full implementation of dietary guidelines (i.e., meeting guideline recommendations for all 5 core food groups and discretionary foods). However, childcare centers in the intervention group provided significantly more servings of fruit (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), vegetables (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), dairy (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), and meat (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003), and reduced servings of discretionary foods (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) on their menus, compared with control centers at 3 mo. This was maintained for fruit (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) and discretionary foods (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) at 12 mo (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This study reports on prospectively registered child outcomes. The reporting of this study adheres to the CONSORT guidelines (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>

                <title>Design and setting</title>
                <p>This study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial utilizing a Type-3 Hybrid implementation-effectiveness design (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) to examine the impact of an intervention to increase the implementation of dietary guidelines in 54 childcare centers in New South Wales, Australia on child-level outcomes (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Such approaches of embedding evaluation of child-level health outcomes within implementation trials have been recommended as a strategy to address existing evidence gaps and provide more valid estimates of potential clinical effectiveness of sector-specific guidelines, and can reduce the time it takes to translate effective guidelines into practice (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Data collection to assess the impact of the intervention on child diet was undertaken with 35 out of the 54 centers recruited to the trial, and is reported here. Centers were approached in random order to reach a quota of 35 consenting centers. This number of services and children was determined based on sample size calculations to detect a meaningful difference and judged as feasible by the research team. Outcome data were collected at baseline and 12-mo follow-up using a repeat cross-sectional assessment. Repeat cross-sectional assessments are recommended where the impact of the intervention is expected at the setting level (i.e., childcare centers) and where high attrition of participants is expected (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The repeat cross-sectional design also allows us to describe the impact of the settings-based intervention on the children who are exposed to the intervention, where dietary improvement is expected to occur.</p>

                <p>All childcare centers were posted an invitation letter and information statement about the study ∼2 wk before receiving a call from a research assistant to assess eligibility and obtain consent. The first 40 childcare centers (oversampling to obtain 35) were asked during the call if they consented to a 1-d site visit. These centers were asked to distribute information and consent forms to parents of children in the room with the highest number of children aged 2–6 y before the scheduled site visit. Consistent with previous approaches by the research team and to maximize consent (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), research assistants also approached parents at drop-off on the day of the visit.</p>

All outcome data assessors were blinded to group allocation.

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The intervention has been described in detail in a previously published protocol (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The web-intervention (“feedAustralia”) was planned to be embedded in a mandatory reporting software program [Childcare Management System (CCMS)] developed by the partner provider (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This was not able to be carried out due to childcare reform at the essential time of integration with CCMS. As a consequence, a stand-alone program was developed allowing childcare centers to access the menu-planning intervention outside of CCMS. To increase uptake of the web-program, design features and strategies targeting the constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model were applied (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The intervention was designed to address primary barriers to guideline implementation identified by application of the Theoretical Domains Framework similar to that previously used in an effective intervention by the research team to improve dietary guideline implementation and child diet (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).

The feedback also outlined whether the menu was compliant with that recommended by sector-specific nutrition guidelines (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The calculation of compliance was underpinned by a national nutrition database containing food group and nutrient information developed by the research team (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p><italic>Reminders</italic>: Childcare centers were also prompted fortnightly in the main CCMS to make changes to their menu to increase compliance if noncompliant, or if they had an incomplete menu in the program.</p>

                    <p><italic>Training, educational resources, and managerial support:</italic> A health promotion officer with experience using the program conducted a 3-h training session with the supervisor and menu planner within each childcare service. The training consisted of updating centers with sector-specific nutrition guidelines, the main features of the online menu-planning program and how to use them, and supporting the service to make changes to their menu. To generate service-level support for use of the program, the health promotion officer also undertook action planning to ensure that allocated time and resources were provided to the menu planner to access the program. Centers were also provided with a portable tablet to facilitate access to the program and recipes during food preparation processes.</p>

                    <p><italic>Ongoing support:</italic> Ongoing support was provided over 2–4 phone calls to childcare service cooks. The purpose of these calls was to provide technical support with using the program and overcome any reported barriers to using the program. The number of phone calls provided to each service was tailored depending on engagement with the program and menu compliance as assessed via analytics data collected via the program. Centers could also seek support via an online “helpdesk” feature available within the program. The helpdesk feature, however, was poorly accessed with no center accessing this.</p>

                <p>To minimize selection bias, research assistants blinded to center allocation sought consent for dietary observations from all parents. After obtaining consent, research assistants randomly selected 6–9 children per center for dietary observations because 1 individual could only observe ≤3 children each. Parents of children selected for dietary observations were asked to report their child's dietary intake outside of care via an online or telephone survey. The remaining parents were asked to complete a telephone survey reporting on their child's HRQoL. To reduce respondent burden, parents completed only questions related to child dietary intake or HRQoL, not both. In addition, educators were asked to complete a questionnaire for each consenting child, reporting on child diet quality, which was developed and validated by the research team for the purpose of this study (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>

Direct observations are the gold standard for assessing dietary intake in care given the amount of spillage and food sharing that occur in this setting (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The research assistants documented the types and portions of foods and beverages served and remaining at the end of each meal for 3 children each. Intake was calculated as the amount of foods served minus foods wasted or remaining. The data were entered into FoodWorks version 9 (Xyris) and converted into servings of food groups by a dietitian using the menu-planning program. All research assistants attended a half-day training course conducted by dietitians with experience undertaking dietary observations in childcare centers. Before undertaking data collection, research assistants needed to score &gt;90% on a certification test estimating the food groups and serving sizes of 5 plates of food frequently served in childcare. Repeated training and testing were undertaken for those who failed to obtain the required level of proficiency.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first trial internationally to examine the impact of a web-based menu-planning tool to support the implementation of dietary guidelines in childcare centers on child dietary intake. The trial found increased consumption of fruit and dairy foods and reduced consumption of discretionary foods and breads and cereals in care as assessed via direct observations. Such findings are encouraging given the amenability of web-based interventions to be delivered at scale with minimal investment, because even modest improvements in child dietary intake can make meaningful contributions to improvement in public health nutrition.</p>
              <p>The study adds to the limited evidence base assessing the impact of strategies to enhance the implementation of dietary guidelines in childcare centers on child dietary intake and supports the positive findings from the quasi-experimental trial included in a recent Cochrane review (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The results are also consistent with the previous RCT conducted by the authors (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Such findings are encouraging given the research team used a highly intensive face-to-face approach across 6 mo, whereas our current study used a lower-intensity approach, primarily delivered via online methods. Whereas this previous study which examined the impact of face-to-face training and support provision for cooks by dietitians to improve menu guideline adherence (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) found improvements in child consumption of vegetables, this study did not. Such findings suggest that although the web-based intervention was able to overcome many important barriers to healthy eating, there may be unique barriers related to consumption of vegetables that need to be better targeted by the online program (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Given this, further research that examines mechanisms of intervention effect is needed to better identify “how” to optimize the intervention in order to maximize its effect on child diet. In addition, because this intervention primarily targets interpersonal and organizational constructs, future interventions should consider including strategies that target child-level constructs including psychological constructs (i.e., perceived modeling, dietary intention, norms, and liking) to increase consumption of healthier options such as vegetables (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p>
              <p>The intervention, however, did not have a significant impact on child diet quality as assessed via the survey completed by childcare educators. The diet quality measure attempts to capture both the quantity and quality of foods consumed by children in care. Whereas the web-based program recommended use of higher-quality (i.e., whole-grain and low-fat foods) ingredients in recipes and supporting resources, the primary component of the intervention focused on supporting services to provide adequate quantities (servings) of core foods and reduce discretionary foods because this was the main challenge to guideline implementation reported by childcare staff. Further, the use of educator report in terms of the lack of direct knowledge of the types of foods consumed (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and the need for educators to recall children's dietary intake over a period of 1 mo may have contributed to these findings. Future iterations of the web intervention may need to consider how to better integrate strategies to improve diet quality, in order to increase the impact of the intervention on child dietary outcomes.</p>
              <p>There were also no significant differences in child BMI <italic>z</italic> scores, consistent with previous childcare-based trials (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). There were, however, positive effects favoring the intervention, where a 9% absolute difference in the percentage of children in the healthy-weight group was observed at follow-up. Other authors have similarly reported challenges with observing significant differences in weight due to the rapid changes in body composition among this age group in 12 mo (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Although nonsignificant, the effect size is promising and consistent with the reductions in servings of discretionary food consumed reported in this study. The relatively short study time-frame, the intervention focus on generally improving diet (rather than reducing energy), as well as the focus of the program on child diet while in care only may not have been of sufficient extent or intensity to have had an impact on BMI. Similarly, the relatively short intervention period as well as challenges with obtaining parent follow-up data may have reduced our ability to detect a difference in child HRQoL scores. However, such findings warrant further investigation given mixed findings from previous childcare-based trials targeting dietary intake.</p>
              <p>Strengths of this study include the randomized design, preregistered dietary outcomes, and use of dietary observations to assess child consumption of food while attending care. However, a number of limitations exist. First, the use of questionnaires completed by educators and parents to assess child diet quality and HRQoL is likely subject to recall and social desirability bias. Despite this, no other validated measures to assess child diet quality while attending care exist, given the need to consider intake over extended periods of time. There was low completion of the telephone survey (54%) for HRQoL owing to challenges contacting parents at follow-up. Centers participating in this study were also limited to those already using the software of our partner provider, which may limit the generalizability of findings. This study utilized a repeat cross-sectional analysis which is recommended for interventions which exert their impact at the cluster level (i.e., improving provision of food at a center level on child diet). We attempted to undertake a cohort analysis; however, as expected there was high attrition of children, with only 14% (<italic>n</italic> = 31) of children at baseline retained at follow-up owing to changeover of rooms and transition to school. Future studies should consider integrating strategies to maximize child retention at follow-up including increasing the number of days of onsite recruitment and liaising with childcare staff and parents to confirm child attendance on the day of data collection. Although this study is unable to provide an indication of change within individual children, it provides robust evidence of intervention impact for children who were exposed to the intervention. Child-level data collection was undertaken with 35 out of the 54 childcare centers participating in the larger trial. This approach was selected owing to the prohibitively high cost of undertaking dietary observations with all childcare centers participating in the study, because centers were spread across a large geographic area. To reduce selection bias, centers were approached in random order. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of centers participating in the evaluation (i.e., size, locality, and socioeconomic status) compared with those not participating in this evaluation, suggesting that this nested sample was representative of the larger sample of centers recruited to the trial.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate that use of a web-based menu-planning program together with support to implement dietary guidelines can improve some measures of child diet in care. Future research assessing the longer-term impact of the intervention on child diet and BMI <italic>z</italic> scores may be warranted to provide a better understanding of the health impact.</p>
