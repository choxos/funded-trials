                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Interventions to better manage aggressive behaviour and reduce recidivism are a primary concern for corrective services. Nutritional interventions to correct prisoner behaviour have been largely overlooked in the literature. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary intake influences aggressive behaviours and that nutritional supplementation with omega-3 longÂ chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) could attenuate both the severity and frequency of aggressive behaviour.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Adult male prisoners who have a history of aggressive behaviour (<italic>n</italic>â=â600) will be recruited from at least 6 Correctional Centres and randomised to receive either n-3 LCPUFA or placebo supplementation for a 16-week duration. Treatment will be with either 1âg/day of n-3 LCPUFA (694âmg DHA and 397âmg EPA) or placebo capsules, which are a corn/soy oil blend and are identical in size and colour.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary outcome measure is the Inmate Behavioural Observation Scale (IBOS): an objective measure of aggressive behaviour. Secondary outcome measures include questionnaires (including aggression, attention deficit disorder, impulsivity, depression/anxiety/stress scales), engagement in programmes, recidivism and quality of life. Baseline and post-intervention assessments include the IBOS, questionnaires and blood to measure the levels of n-3 LCPUFA.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">To conclusively test the potential that increasing n-3 LCPUFA intakes can improve rates of prisoner aggression and associated mental health and violence-related social system management costs, we propose an adequately powered multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, examining the effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on aggressive behaviour in adult maleÂ prisoners. If successful, this study will inform prisoner policy with respect to nutrition and by inference contribute to a broader community approach to preventative mental health practices.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par23">While the importance of good nutrition for optimal mental health is increasingly being recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], poor nutrition and low educational attainment are more common in low socio-economic groups and both are defining characteristics of prisoner populations. A vast body of literature has attested to the benefits of dietary supplementation on mental health issues in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and an emerging literature suggests that dietary supplementation may also impact upon aggressive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nutrition is rarely supplemented as a strategy for improving prison behavioural outcomes, even as part of existing mental health intervention programmes which tend to focus on acute needs rather than long-term management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Given substantial societal costs associated with violence and the potential for violence prevention with a simple, accessible and low-cost dietary modification among those at elevated risk of these behaviours, rigorous studies to establish an evidence base are required. The proposed study is designed to contribute to that broad endeavour.</p>

                  <title>Why n-3 LCPUFA?</title>
                  <p id="Par24">Omega-3 longÂ chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) have cardiovascular health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and there is emerging evidence for n-3 LCPUFA benefits for mental health benefit, including reducing violent or aggressive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par25">n-3 LCPUFA were discovered in the 1970s when researchers set out to investigate why Inuit people of Greenland had high consumption of fat via whale, seal and fish yet low incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Their findings were extended to other populations that had high fish consumption and low CVD incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and n-3 LCPUFA have since been associated with numerous health benefits. However, it is well established that n-3 LCPUFA are specifically and substantially deficient in Australian (âWesternâ) diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This is due to relatively low consumption of fish/seafood, the richest sources of n-3 LCPUFA, in particular the semi-essential eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The development of an âomega-3 indexâ (erythrocyte EPAâ+âDHA levels as percent of total fatty acids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], pooling results from numerous trials in cardiac disease, showed that an index â¤4% was associated with the greatest risk for cardiac mortality while â¥8% conferred the greatest protection. In Australia, the average index is 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Addressing the n-3 LCPUFA controversy</title>
                  <p id="Par26">Randomised controlled trials and meta-analysis of trials up to 2002 demonstrated that supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA resulted in up to 45% reduction in overall mortality from cardiac death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, reviews and meta-analyses of more recent trials reported a lack of efficacy, questioning whether increased n-3 LCPUFA levels improve health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, critical analyses of these recent trials have suggested that their observed lack of efficacy may have been due to methodological problems arising across populations studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Following the earlier successful trials, the American Heart Association issued guidelines for people with heart disease, suggesting consumption of at least 2 fish meals per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in addition to fish oil supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Between 2000 and 2010, the importation of fish oils into the USA escalated more than 10-fold from 2000 to 22,000 metric tonnes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, trials conducted after 2002 failed to screen people for high fish and/or fish oil supplement intake resulting in great variability of n-3 LCPUFA status across trial conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Where screening did occur, the upper 50% of the control subjects and the lower 50% of the fish oil intervention subjects overlapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], suggesting that the 2 groups were not separated enough in use of fish oils to demonstrate an effect in the test arm (n-3 LCPUFA). Thus, robust trials of using fish oil to address omega-3 deficiency need to attenuate possible ceiling effects created by high baseline levels, by taking blood samples to determine compliance and correlations between increased omega-3 index and response. This is supported by the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids (ISSFAL) recent position statement, which highlights the importance of measuring blood n-3 LCPUFA levels in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

                  <title>n-3 LCPUFA and mental health</title>
                  <p id="Par27">Both EPA and DHA are important for optimal brain function and have different mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. DHA is a structural component of neurons, affecting both physicochemical properties of the neuronal membrane (such as membrane fluidity and permeability) but also neurotransmission through gene expression modulation, neuronal enzyme activity and postsynaptic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Due to its involvement in the regulation of the central neurotransmission such as dopamine and serotonin, DHA along with EPA administration seems beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. EPA is not concentrated in neural cell membranes but it may have neuro-immunological and vascular effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. EPA competes with the omega-6 arachidonic acid for the production of eicosanoids, and the EPA-derived eicosanoids have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombogenic and vasodilatory effects resulting in increased blood flow in the brain and improved neuroprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is well established that DHA plays an important role in neurological development and suboptimal levels are associated with mental health issues such as hyperactivity, poor impulse control and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and low omega-3 index (an average of 4.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and an average of 3.0% in people at ultra-high risk of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]) is associated with increased mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, a body of research has investigated the role of n-3 LCPUFA acids in mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

Significant decreases in anger and anxiety in a population of substance abusers were reported after supplementation of EPA and DHA for 3âmonths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. EPA has also been shown to reduce antisocial and aggressive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

                  <title>Prisoner populations, mental health and violence</title>
                  <p id="Par30">The logistics of conducting intervention trials in corrective services settings are challenging, and hence, only two supplementation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have been published to date in Europe in adult male prisoners. Both of these well-controlled studies showed that, with nutritional supplementation of multivitamins/minerals and n-3 LCPUFA, there was a 26â35% reduction in the number and severity of in-prison reprimands, particularly for violent behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, both of these studies had two significant limitations. First, neither of these studies acquired blood samples to measure the changes in n-3 LCPUFA and hence these studies were unable to correlate the changes in blood n-3 LCPUFA levels with reduced aggressive behaviour. We collected blood samples in our recent feasibility study and will address this limitation in the proposed multi-centre trial. Second, the measure of aggression used within the two previous studies, in-prison reprimands, is influenced by variability both within and between institutions with respect to rules and tolerance (Byrne MK, Cortie CH, Meyer BJ. The Inmate Behaviour Observation Scale (IBOS): A measure of prisoner aggression and violence based on inmate case notes, in preparation/forthcoming). In this study, we used the IBOS, which more specifically targets aggressive behaviour and is less susceptible to institutional variationÂ (Byrne MK, Cortie CH, Meyer BJ. The Inmate Behaviour Observation Scale (IBOS): A measure of prisoner aggression and violence based on inmate case notes, in preparation/forthcoming).</p>
                  <p id="Par31">We conducted a feasibility/pilot study at the South Coast Correctional Centre (SCCC)Â in Nowra, NSW, in 2013 in adult male prisoners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The sample was restricted to male prisoners for both pragmatic and scientific reasons. With regard to the former, the number of female inmates is greatly fewer than male inmates. As such, the task of recruiting a sufficient sample of female offenders for both the purposes of within-group and between-group comparisons was deemed to be difficult to achieve. More importantly perhaps, the literature suggests that female prisoners tend to internalise their anger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and that the primary antecedents of female offending are predominantly environmental challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition to this, there is evidence that the metabolism and bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids differ between males and females, a variable that would influence the interpretation of results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par32">Baseline data showed negative correlations between blood n-3 LCPUFA levels and measures of aggressive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We have shown that conducting a supplementation trial in a Correctional Centre is feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and the study design for the multi-centre trial is based on these recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]: (1) to collaborate with, and receive support from the Department of Correctional Services; (2) the need to provide incentives to prisoners to aid in recruitment; (3) having an external pathology provider take the blood samples; (4) a designated Correctional Officer as a Project Officer to ensure compliance; (5) the need to restrict buy-ups of cans of tuna and n-3 LCPUFA supplements to reduce potential confoundings; (6) the Correctional Officers require training on how to score the IBOS and how to complete the questionnaires; and (7) the inclusion and exclusion criteria need to ensure that participants are likely to remain in the study for the study duration, are aggressive at baseline (IBOS of 1 or greater) and have an omega-3 index below 6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Inmate Behaviour Observation Scale (IBOS)</title>
                  <p id="Par59">Actual instances of hostile and aggressive behaviour are routinely recorded as prisoner incident reports, where an officer considers the behaviour substantial enough to warrant sanction. However, the intensity of such behaviour required to warrant sanction fails to capture the range and diversity of hostile and aggressive behaviours and thus results in a low incidence rate. Further, different jurisdictions have developed different metrics for the classification of behavioural disorder. Thus, (Byrne MK, Cortie CH, Meyer BJ. The Inmate Behaviour Observation Scale (IBOS): A measure of prisoner aggression and violence based on inmate case notes, in preparation/forthcoming)Â developed a generic behavioural observation rating scale (IBOS) for use across jurisdictions. The IBOS is a 7-point scale which classifies prisoner behaviours across an 8-week period using data derived from individual prisoner case notes. Case notes are routinely recorded by custodial and non-custodial staff in the Offender Integrated Management System (OIMS) database to report and capture a majority of significant observations and interactions with prisoners. A score of ââ1 is applied to all instances recorded in that week of <italic>pro-social behaviour</italic>, while a score of 0 is given if there were no behaviours of significance recorded. Thereafter, instances of hostile/aggressive behaviour are scored from 1 (non-compliant) to 5 (physically aggressive), with each level of hostility/aggression operationally defined and illustrated by examples. Thus, higher scores are associated with greater levels of aggressive behaviour. Inter-rater reliability of the IBOS was 0.844 for repeat ratersÂ (Byrne MK, Cortie CH, Meyer BJ. The Inmate Behaviour Observation Scale (IBOS): A measure of prisoner aggression and violence based on inmate case notes, in preparation/forthcoming). The IBOS is a validated tool that can be used across jurisdictions. The IBOS is significantly correlated with institutional records of misconduct or reprimands (Byrne MK, Cortie CH, Meyer BJ. The Inmate Behaviour Observation Scale (IBOS): A measure of prisoner aggression and violence based on inmate case notes, in preparation/forthcoming)Â which are the most common measure of aggression in prison studies. The IBOS has been found to significantly correlate with both the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) and the Brownâs Attention Deficit Disorder Scales (BADDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and given that the AQ and the BADDS are also significantly correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], this adds to its construct validity.</p>

It is an identified, internally linked dataset containing records of all finalised court appearances in the Local, District and Supreme Courts of NSW since 1994. An individualâs recorded aliases are also included. The internal matching process of this database has been previously validated. Key variables include sex, month and year of birth and offending history (e.g. principal offence type, offence date, median sentence ranking [offence seriousness], number of concurrent offences, number of court appearances with at least one prison penalty, number of court appearances for a violent offence). The ROD will be used to measure categories of post-release of reoffending, given this database is a sensitive measure which is independent of public policy and incarceration rates. The number, severity and frequency of re-offences will be quantified. Recidivism rates for categories of offence will be calculated over a 2-year period for those participants who have been released.

                  <title>A framework for national dietary supplementation</title>
                  <p id="Par72">If a robust evidence base is established for the efficacy of omega-3 supplementation on behavioural improvement, attention enhancement and engagement in correctional rehabilitation, the first translational challenge is to disseminate the programme nationally. This will require, in the first instance, a framework for the dissemination of supplements across jurisdictions, accounting for health considerations (such as prisoner use of blood thinning agents as part of their medical treatment), leveraging the Corrective Services Advisory Committee and, in particular, the network of AI LG. To do this, dietary outcomes would need to first be linked to extant policies on prisoner nutrition (such as the Corrective Services Industries Food Servicesâ Nutrition Policy Statement, 2015), indicating the obligation for a minimum intake of omega-3-rich foodstuffs. Next, stakeholder dialogue of a National Round Table (NRT) of Corrective Services policy makers through the Corrective Services Administrators Council to agree on a Policy Statement on the minimum supplementation schedule to achieve clinical outcomes commensurate with the evidence base. A briefing document, containing all relevant information, would be provided to the stakeholders and real-time feedback sought to ensure a high response rate. Following the NRT, the research team could collaborate with key stakeholders to develop a tool-kit for rollout in each jurisdiction for âsystem readinessâ by involving and mobilising ground-level stakeholders, human resources and service infrastructure requirements, management systems and monitoring and evaluation systems.</p>

                  <title>Educational programme for prisoners</title>
                  <p id="Par73">To effectively implement the programme, prisoners will need to be both consulted and educated about the range of health benefits associated with omega-3 supplementation. This will involve consultation with prisoner representative groups and cultural sensitivity advisors to establish a protocol for the dissemination of information. The delivery of the educational package will be modelled on the NSW Corrective Services âHealthy Survival Tipsâ programme which involves a 4-h education programme on induction to prison with the SAPO (Services and Program Officer); a pre-release programme, integrated into programmes similar to the Corrective Services NSW âNexusâ; and the provision of written âbrochureâ material on âHealthy Living Outside Gaolâ where omega-3 supplementation may be integrated into general health advice. Given the low level of formal education received (results from feasibility trial) and the associated lack of health literacy skills, in addition to the aforementioned educational packages, prisoners will also educate themselves and champion findings. For example, in the feasibility study, the prisoners did a rap video âOmega-3s are the key, they are good for you and good for meâ.</p>

                  <title>Adherence to treatment practices and policies</title>
                  <p id="Par74">Adherence to health interventions is a perennial problem across health contexts and is likely to be an issue with omega-3 supplementation. A broad range of adherence interventions exist. First and foremost, the fiscal cost of maintenance post-release will need to be addressed. To manage this, Commonwealth support similar to PBS schemes should be established. This would require liaison with the Federal Minister and/or his/her representatives informed by evidence of joint health and social system effect of omega-3 supplementation on violence and recidivism rates and related economic consideration of expected downstream health and social systems savings relative to investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] in omega-3 supplements in prison populations. Advocacy for a âHealth Care Cardâ system where purchase of prescribed omega-3 supplements by former prisoners is subsidised could be sought. Additionally, with positive findings post-release, supervision policies could be negotiated at the federal and state level (incorporated in discussions under âNational Frameworkâ above) whereby adherence issues are resolved at a prisoner by prisoner level. A brief training video would also be disseminated to Probation and Parole offices via YouTube to enhance adherence management skills relevant to omega-3 intake.</p>

                <p id="Par77">Our study is a randomised controlled trial powered to show a difference between treatment and placebo control of 25% in the proportion of participants experiencing a reduction in aggressive behaviour as measured by a change in the IBOS. Given the nature of the prison populations, it is likely that there will be an effect of prison in the analysis, and therefore, a design effect accounting for the intra-cluster correlation is incorporated in the sample size estimation with a conservatively estimated ICC of 0.03. Based on our pilot data, we anticipate that attrition will likely be high (~â40%) with the sample size for recruitment appropriately inflated to account for this. Overall, a total sample size of 600 with 360 completing the study enables a difference of 25% to be detected with 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05.</p>

                <p id="Par78">We were able to recruit 136 prisoners in only 1 day at the SCCCfor our feasibility study. The success of this recruitment was primarily due to what the trial was able to offer: a perception of increased muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and receiving compensation for inconvenience ($30 at baseline and $50 post-trial). Taking into account the inclusion criteria of this multi-centre trial, of those 136 prisoners, 34 would be excluded due to high omega-3 index (data from our feasibility study). Given that recruitment will occur at multiple centres with one or two cohorts per site as necessary, we anticipate comfortably meeting our targets of 600 prisoners and 360 completions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par119">At least 45% of prisoners in Australia are incarcerated for violent offences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Approximately 46% of prisoners have experienced a mental health disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The rate of prisoner on prisoner assault reported in NSW and QLD prisons is 34% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par120">Prisoners cost the nation $2.6 billion in 2013â2014 after expenses, with the average daily cost per prisoner exceeding the average Australianâs daily income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Should the intervention reduce aggressive behaviour by 25%, the estimated impact upon institutional violence would be an 8.5% reduction based on extant assault prevalence rates (34%). Some estimations of cost savings across prison populations nationally would suggest up to $236 million/year (at a conservative $8500 per aggressive prison patient prevented). This intervention also has potential to enhance overall prisoner health outcomes and if omega-3 use is maintained post-incarceration to reduce violent recidivism.</p>
              <p id="Par121">Our feasibility study showed that prisoners are 4.3 times more likely to have an IBOS of &gt;â2, if they are below the cutoff of 6% omega-3 index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] but this does not show causality. This multi-centre trial is adequately powered to demonstrate the effect of n-3 LCPUFA on aggressive behaviour in adult male prisoners. The strengths of this study include the IBOS, measuring n-3 LCPUFA levels in the blood and, after demonstrating efficacy, rolling out into policy and practice and the health economics. The IBOS eliminates cross- and intra-jurisdictional variations in reprimands, robustly accounting for prisoner aggressive behaviours. The blood n-3 LCPUFA assessments will verify that the reduction in aggressive behaviour is related to an increase in n-3 LCPUFA. Once we demonstrate efficacy, we will translate into policy and practice across all jurisdictions in Australia. Given the high costs associated with prisoner aggressive behaviour, substantial cost savings are expected.</p>
              <p id="Par122">Our research team has the track record to navigate studies through the ethics approval process, as evidenced by the feasibility studies and publication outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This research will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving Humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. This research will follow the CONSORT guidelines and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.</p>
              <p id="Par123">We are aware of ethical considerations in research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including reciprocity, respect, equality, responsibility, survival and protection, spirit and integrity. Therefore, we believe that in the spirit of these considerations, it is important for Indigenous people in the institution to be given the same opportunity to take part in this research. The research does not include a focus on culturally specific issues; all people regardless of ethnicity can potentially derive benefits from the nutrients that are the focus of this research.</p>
              <p id="Par124">Informed consent will be obtained from all study participants and there will be no coercion. Each participant will be provided with a unique study code identifier. The Project Officer at each site will provide each participant with their supplements and supervise them taking the supplements, which will minimise intimidation for access to individual capsules. The Project Officer will keep one data file with the prisonersâ names and their unique study code identifier, hence ensuring confidentiality. All research data will be stored in another de-identified dataset containing the unique study code identifier, hence allaying concerns about blood data being shared.</p>
              <p id="Par125">This trial is a partnership between academic researchers, DSM Nutritional Products, and Correctional Services NSW and the Department for Correctional Services SA. The role of DSM Nutritional Products is to supply the omega-3 (algal oil) and placebo oil capsules as in-kind support, plus provide substantial cash contribution for this research. The role of Correctional Centres in NSW and SA is to provide in-kind support of personnel (MOSP/MOD) who have the responsibility for case management in each centre and the selection of prisoners for suitability for the rehabilitation programmes. The Project Officers (on secondment to this research) will liaise with the MOSP/MOD and collect the data on improved engagement in programmes. The role of the Corrective Services Assistant Commissioners (including AI LG, Deputy Commissioner, Strategic Policy and Planning CSNSW) is to take a lead role from our team to manage the translation into policy and practice as described above.</p>
              <p id="Par126">The expected outcome is that supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA will reduce prisoner aggressive behaviour (as measured by the IBOS and the number and severity of reprimands), reduce aggressive disposition (AQ), attenuate attention deficit disorder behaviours (BADDS), reduce impulsiveness (BIS-brief), improve overall health and wellbeing (SF-36) and enhance rehabilitation programme engagement and gains. Increased and sustained attendance at Correctional Programs should ultimately reduce recidivism. The commitment by our collective team including communication expert and AI LG will ensure translation into policy and practice as described.</p>
              <p id="Par127">The significance of this research is the potential to improve mental health through nutritional supplementation while reducing the incidence of aggressive behaviour. This can contribute to reduced sentencing and time in custody as well as stress and burden on corrective services staff, including costs on corrective services. N-3 LCPUFA are considered to be the building blocks of good mental health, and they provide a low-cost (&lt;$100 per year per person) and low-risk addition to a suite of mental health interventions in correctional centres. The Australian Institute of Criminology estimates that assaults alone cost Australia nearly $2.5 billion a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Given that between 35 and 41% of prisoners will be a recidivist within 2âyears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], any reduction in ongoing offending behaviour is likely to yield substantial social and economic benefit. The Health economist (CIE SE) will estimate the actual cost saving expected given trial effects observed as part of this project. Furthermore, the findings from this project have the potential for substantially broader benefits across social systems and for society if aggression and violent behaviour and metal health issues of prison populations are reduced.</p>
