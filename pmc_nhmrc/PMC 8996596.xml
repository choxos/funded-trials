                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Globally, bronchiectasis (BE) unrelated to cystic fibrosis (CF) is recognized as a major cause of respiratory morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization. Children with BE regularly experience exacerbations of their condition resulting in frequent hospitalizations and decreased health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Guidelines for the treatment and management of BE call for regular exercise as a means of improving aerobic fitness and HR-QoL. Moreover, research in adults with BE has shown that exercise can reduce the frequency of exacerbations, a potent predictor of future lung function decline and respiratory morbidity. Yet, to date, the health benefits resulting from therapeutic exercise have not been investigated in children with BE. The BREATH, Bronchiectasis - Exercise as Therapy, trial will test the efficacy of a novel 8-week, play-based therapeutic exercise program to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations over 12 months in children with BE (aged ≥ 4 and &lt; 13 years). Secondary aims are to determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and assess the program’s impact on aerobic fitness, fundamental movement skill (FMS) proficiency, habitual physical activity, HR-QoL, and lung function.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This multi-center, observer-blinded, parallel-group (1:1 allocation), randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted at three sites. One hundred and seventy-four children ≥ 4 and &lt; 13 years of age with BE will be randomized to a developmentally appropriate, play-based therapeutic exercise program (eight, 60-min weekly sessions, supplemented by a home-based program) or usual care. After completing the baseline assessments, the number of exacerbations and secondary outcomes will be assessed immediately post-intervention, after 6 months of follow-up, and after 12 months of follow-up. Monthly, parental contact and medical review will document acute respiratory exacerbations and parameters for cost-effectiveness outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The BREATH trial is the first fully powered RCT to test the effects of a therapeutic exercise on exacerbation frequency, fitness, movement competence, and HR-QoL in children with bronchiectasis. By implementing a developmentally appropriate, play-based exercise program tailored to the individual needs of children with bronchiectasis, the results have the potential for a major paradigm shift in the way in which therapeutic exercise is prescribed and implemented in children with chronic respiratory conditions. The exercise program can be readily translated. It does not require expensive equipment and can be delivered in a variety of settings, including the participant’s home. The program has strong potential for translation to other pediatric patient groups with similar needs for exercise therapy, including those with obesity, childhood cancers, and neurological conditions such as cerebral palsy.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par39">Bronchiectasis (BE) unrelated to cystic fibrosis (CF) is a major cause of respiratory morbidity and a significant contributor to health care utilization in children and adolescents globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is the end point of the chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) continuum and is described as abnormal irreversible dilatation of the airways and associated with airway infection and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Children with BE regularly experience exacerbations of their condition (increased wetness and severity of cough, breathlessness, chest pain, and/or wheeze) resulting in frequent hospitalizations and decreased health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Prevalence data in children are scarce; however, a recent review of the epidemiology of CLSD estimated the prevalence of BE to range from 0.2 to 15 cases per 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. BE is particularly prevalent among socially disadvantaged populations, such as indigenous communities of Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, and Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A study of Central Australian Aboriginal children reported the prevalence as high as one in every 68 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par40">The treatment goals of multi-disciplinary management are to prevent airway damage and optimize quality of life and minimize exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend general exercise to improve aerobic fitness and HR-QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the health impacts associated with therapeutic exercise in children with BE are not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of the effects of exercise training on physical and psychosocial health in children with chronic respiratory disease identified no published studies investigating the impact of therapeutic exercise in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therapeutic exercise may benefit children with BE by reducing the frequency and severity of acute exacerbations—an independent predictor of a long-term decline in lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effects of an 8-week exercise program in adults with BE reported significant reductions in the number of acute exacerbations over a 12-month period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, therapeutic exercise programs may also reduce the risk of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, depression, and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par41">It is known that children with BE are not sufficiently active to obtain the health benefits associated with regular physical activity (PA). Using an accelerometer to objectively measure daily physical activity, Joschtel and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found children with BE to have low levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Expressed as a percentage of the waking hours, children with BE were sedentary for 57.5% of the time, in light-intensity PA 35.8% of the time, and in MVPA just 6.7% of the time. Indeed, only two children (5.6%) achieved the recommended 60 min of daily MVPA described in the Australian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Young People. In contrast, 42% of healthy children in the normative comparison group achieved the guideline. On average, children with BE accumulated 8229 steps/day, well below the recommended 12,000 steps/day. In comparison, daily step counts in healthy children ranged from 11,500 to 14,500 steps/day.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Fundamental movement skill (FMS) proficiency is an important determinant of children’s current and future physical activity status and a significant contributor to individual health and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The development of FMSs early in life is critical to establishing the more complex movement patterns required for participation in all types of play, games, physical activities, and sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Children who are proficient in FMSs are more likely to participate in and enjoy physical activity, achieve higher levels of aerobic fitness, exhibit higher levels of perceived competence and self-esteem, and are less likely to be overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has been shown that children with BE exhibit significant delays in their FMS development, thus compromising their ability, confidence, and motivation to participate in PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In a study of 46 children with BE, only nine (19.6%) achieved their age equivalency for locomotor skills, while just four (8.7%) achieved their age equivalency for object control skills. Fewer than 5% of children demonstrated mastery in the run, gallop, hop, and leap, while fewer than 10% demonstrated mastery for the two-handed strike, overarm throw, and underarm throw. Importantly, children achieving their age equivalency for locomotor or object control skills exhibited higher levels of MVPA, perceived competence, and HR-QoL than children with developmental delays in FMSs.</p>
                <p id="Par43">To address the concerns that children with BE are insufficiently active for health benefits and that developmental delays in fundamental movement skill proficiency are a root cause, we have developed a novel, play-based therapeutic exercise program specifically designed to improve FMS proficiency and aerobic fitness in children with BE. In a pilot RCT involving 21 children with BE, the program significantly improved FMS proficiency, with a 21% increase in locomotion skills and a 31% increase in object control. The effect sizes associated with these improvements were, by convention, large (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> ≥ 1.2). The program also had a moderate positive effect on aerobic fitness (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We now propose to expand this program to a large multi-center RCT to evaluate the efficacy of our exercise program in reducing the frequency of acute exacerbations of BE. Exacerbation frequency is the only known risk factor for lung function decline in children with BE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Reducing the frequency of exacerbations during childhood through therapeutic exercise may be an important clinical management strategy for preventing a future decline in lung function and respiratory morbidity later in life.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par44">This multi-center RCT is designed to answer the primary research question: does therapeutic exercise decrease the frequency of exacerbations in children with BE? Therefore, the primary objective is to test the efficacy of a novel 8-week, play-based therapeutic exercise program to reduce the incidence of acute exacerbations over 12 months in children with BE aged ≥ 4 and &lt; 13 years. The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of children with no exacerbations at 12 months will be significantly higher in participants receiving an exercise program than in participants in the wait-list control condition.</p>
                <p id="Par45">The secondary objectives are to (1) conduct an economic evaluation of the program and (2) evaluate the effects of the program on FMS proficiency, objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), cardiorespiratory function (CRF), perceived movement competence, health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), and lung function (FEV1). Our secondary hypothesis is that the program will be cost-effective and efficacious in improving FMS proficiency, daily MVPA, CRF, perceived movement competence, HR-QoL, and lung function.</p>

                <p id="Par47">The RCT will be conducted at the Queensland Children’s Hospital (QCH), Gold Cold University Hospital (GCUH), and Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH) in Australia. QCH is a metropolitan tertiary level hospital providing specialized services to children living in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The QCH has a dedicated Respiratory and Sleep Medicine Department with approximately 15 senior medical officers. GCUH is a tertiary-level facility that includes a pediatric respiratory service with two pediatric respiratory physicians.

                  <p id="Par52">Children allocated to the intervention will receive the therapeutic exercise program delivered by an accredited exercise physiologist or physiotherapist. The program will include eight 60-min weekly sessions supplemented by a home-based program (two sessions per week for 8 weeks, approximately 20 min per session). This program was designed from the feasibility pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Group sessions of up to six children will be conducted in community venues at different times and locations to accommodate family schedules. During group sessions, the children will participate in a warm-up and a circuit of six independent games targeting fundamental movement skills and cardiovascular fitness followed by a group game then cool down. The games alternate from higher to lower intensity and can be modified to match each child’s abilities. Children monitor their progress in a “Games Passport” and collect stickers to track their completed sessions. The home program is based on games from the group sessions. Parents receive a detailed manual describing the activities to complete in the home sessions and strategies to support and encourage children to complete the activities. Each week, the child will choose two new activities to complete with their parent at home. Parents document the number of home sessions completed each week on a chart along with the child’s perceived effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The chart is reviewed by the instructor at the next weekly session.</p>
                  <p id="Par53">Prior to leading group sessions, instructors will complete 12-h of comprehensive training led by the exercise physiology and physiotherapy study investigators. Each instructor will review the intervention manual and standard operating procedures and watch videos demonstrating the setup, instructions, modifications, and basic movements for each component of the session. The training will start with the observation of the games with a focus on feedback and reflection. It will progress to leading full sessions with children, including the rehearsal of scripts developed for the home program and tracking. For quality assurance and program fidelity, heart rate data from a sensor will be collected from a sample of sessions, and instructors will complete an essential element checklist after each session. The checklist will include comments about the games completed in the session and confirmation that home session data were collected. Once the intervention has commenced, the lead exercise physiologist or physiotherapist will intermittently visit each community venue to ensure the intervention is being delivered as outlined in the study materials and training sessions.</p>

                  <p id="Par68">For the primary objective, the intervention effect is the difference in the percentage of children exacerbation free at 12-months follow-up. Based on the results of an RCT in which the percentage of children exacerbation free in the control group at 12 months was 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the percentage without an exacerbation over 12-months was estimated to be 20%. Based on the results of an exercise training RCT conducted on 55 adults with BE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we expect the therapeutic exercise program to double the percentage of children exacerbation free at 12 months follow-up from 20 to 40%. Assuming a 2-tailed alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 79 per group (<italic>N</italic> = 158) will provide 80% power to detect the projected 20% group difference in the percentage of children exacerbation free at 12 months follow-up.

For the primary objective, a binary regression model with a suitably chosen link function (e.g., logistic) will be used where the target variable is whether or not an exacerbation occurred over the 12-month study period for each subject. The main covariate of interest is the treatment group (exercise vs. wait-list control). Other covariates potentially influencing the target variable such as age and sex will be considered. Therefore, the statistically determined treatment effect will be appropriately adjusted for unbalanced data with respect to the other important covariates retained in the regression model. Between-group differences in secondary outcomes—aerobic fitness, habitual PA, perceived competence, HR-QoL (PedsQL), and lung function (FEV1)—will be tested immediately post-intervention, at 6 months follow-up, and at 12 months follow-up using linear regression with treatment group (exercise vs. wait-list control) as the main effect and baseline measures of the respective outcome, along with other potential confounders (e.g., age, sex), as covariates.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par93">Pediatric BE is a significant contributor to global mortality, morbidity, and healthcare utilization, yet there is a paucity of research on non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim to improve HR-QoL and impact disease progression for this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It has been established that children with BE have delayed FMS proficiency leading to insufficient physical activity for health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A pilot RCT involving 21 children with BE demonstrated that a therapeutic exercise program is feasible and potentially efficacious in improving FMS proficiency and fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A larger, fully powered RCT is now needed to determine the long-term impacts of the program, specifically the effects on acute exacerbations and HR-QoL.</p>
              <p id="Par94">This multi-center RCT will establish and test a highly scalable, therapeutic exercise program to reduce the proportion of children with no exacerbations of BE over 12 months and improve movement competency, HR-QoL, and exercise capacity. Improvements in these outcomes are likely to have an immediate positive impact on physical functioning, quality of life, and future health. BE exacerbation is the only known risk factor for lung function decline in this patient group. Thus, reducing the frequency of exacerbations during childhood through therapeutic exercise may be an important clinical management strategy for preventing a future decline in lung function and respiratory morbidity later in life.</p>
              <p id="Par95">This RCT is significant because it is the first fully powered RCT to test the effects of a therapeutic exercise program to prevent exacerbations and improve FMS proficiency, fitness, and HR-QoL in children with BE. By implementing a developmentally appropriate, play-based exercise program tailored to the individual needs of children with BE, the results have the potential for a major paradigm shift in the way in which therapeutic exercise is prescribed and implemented in children with chronic respiratory conditions. The exercise program can be readily translated. It does not require expensive equipment and can be delivered in a variety of settings, including the participant’s home. The program of research has strong potential for translation to other pediatric patient groups with similar needs for exercise therapy, including those with obesity, childhood cancers, and neurological conditions such as cerebral palsy. While exercise is well recognized to be universally beneficial, this RCT is required because it will provide long overdue level 1 evidence regarding the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of tailored therapeutic exercise programs for children with BE.</p>
