                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Dental decay is a major problem among Australian children. It can be prevented through good self-care and limiting sugar intake, but many parents/caregivers lack the skills and confidence to help their children adopt these practices. This trial will evaluate the efficacy of <italic toggle="yes">Healthy Habits Triple P - Oral health,</italic> a web-based online programme, in improving children’s oral health-related behaviours (toothbrushing, snacking practices and dental visits) and related parenting practices, thereby preventing dental caries.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a cluster, parallel-group, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial of an online intervention for parents/caregivers of children aged 2–6 years. From the City of Gold Coast (Australia), 18 childcare centres will be randomly selected, with equal numbers randomised into intervention and control arms. Intervention arm parents/caregivers will receive access to a web-based parenting intervention while those in the control arm will be directed to oral health-related information published by Australian oral health agencies. After the completion of the study, the <italic toggle="yes">Healthy Habits Triple P - Oral health</italic> intervention will be offered to parents/caregivers in the control arm. The primary outcome of this trial is toothbrushing frequency, which will be assessed via Bluetooth supported smart toothbrushes and parent/caregiver report. Data on other outcomes: parenting practices and child behaviour during toothbrushing, consumption of sugar rich foods and parents’ confidence in dealing with children’s demands for sugar rich food, and dental visiting practices, will be collected through a self-administered questionnaire at baseline (before randomisation), and 6 weeks (primary endpoint), 6 months and 12 months after randomisation. Data on dental caries will be collected at baseline, 12 and 18 months post-randomisation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Dental diseases are very common among Australian children, with caries being more than five times as prevalent as asthma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Untreated dental caries in children can lead to significant pain and affect overall quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although there has been a general decline in caries experience among children in higher-income countries in recent decades, the prevalence in children in Australia is still high. For instance, 40% of children aged 5–10 years have caries in their deciduous dentition with a mean caries experience of 3.1 tooth surfaces and 20% of children experienced 80% of the overall dental caries burden. Further, children from low-income families, especially those with an Indigenous background, living in rural or remote regions had higher prevalence and caries experience than their counterparts.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Recent research indicates that Australia is among the top five countries in the world with the highest expenditure due to dental disease.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Dental decay is the result of a complex interaction between fermentable dietary carbohydrates and acid producing bacteria.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Regular toothbrushing and restricted sugar intake help in preventing dental caries.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In our meta-analysis, we found a significant association between toothbrushing frequency and incidence of dental caries.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The extent that tooth surfaces are cleaned and the time spent on brushing are also important for effective prevention of disease.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, national data reveal that half of Australian children brush less than twice every day with a fluoridated toothpaste,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> while the recommended frequency is at least twice a day.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Most children also consume sugar-sweetened beverages every day.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> High caries rates in Australian children can be attributed to poor oral health-related practices.</p>
              <p>Our previous research has shown that parents’ child rearing practices could influence children’s oral hygiene practices, levels of dental caries and overall quality of life.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Findings from both observational and experimental research indicate that when parents (hereinafter, word ‘parent/s’ will be taken to include all caregivers for children) are more supportive of children’s needs, children tend to develop more positive health behaviours, including oral hygiene behaviours.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In particular, children younger than 6 years require assistance and supervision from their parents in performing regular oral hygiene and making healthy food choices. Children in this age group are amenable to behaviour change, particularly when change is parent-led and consistently reinforced. Importantly, healthy practices adopted in childhood are more likely to continue into adolescence and adulthood.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>Although most parents are aware of their role in influencing children’s self-care practices, they may lack motivation, planning, skills and confidence in executing those practices, including adoption of positive toothbrushing behaviours.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> For instance, a study found that many Australian children did not adhere to recommended behavioural practices in spite of their parents being aware of these,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> which might be due to a lack of skills and confidence among parents in promotion of healthy behaviours in their children. Parents’ lack of competence in supporting children’s oral health practices may arise from low levels of self-efficacy, viz: beliefs about their own abilities to perform a specific behaviour.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>There is abundant evidence that parenting interventions are helpful in improving both parental self-efficacy and child self-regulation with respect to child behaviour.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Self-regulation constitutes the ability of an individual to regulate their own behaviours, cognitions and emotions with respect to external demands.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Parents of young children are key to influencing children’s health behaviours both distally by making healthy choices for them (eg, buying healthy foods) and also proximally through parenting practices that promote children’s self-regulation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Parenting interventions that promote positive, consistent and effective parenting behaviours have been widely evaluated and are the treatment of choice for child behaviour problems.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref> While most of these interventions have focused on child emotional and behavioural problems,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> there is emerging evidence to suggest that such interventions can impact parenting practices related to children’s health, for example, in the context of obesity, asthma, eczema and other chronic illnesses.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> Many of these interventions are lengthy and delivered face-to-face, and barriers that can prevent parents from attending and benefitting from these interventions include time constraints, caregiving demands, transport or other logistics.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> More recently, online interventions have shown promising results in several domains of health.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> Such online or digital interventions for improving parenting practices related to oral health are rare. Many studies have been targeted to parents to improve parent supervised toothbrushing behaviour among children less than 8 years old. A systematic review found that among these interventions, most focused on parental knowledge, were intensive, delivered at home or in healthcare settings, and were not supported by a theoretical framework.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Only one study used a smartphone application to improve parental knowledge regarding children’s oral health behaviours.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Literature indicates that health education interventions aimed at improving oral health outcomes in children have been found effective for limited clinical outcomes (eg, plaque).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The aims of this project are to test an online intervention for parents to promote toothbrushing and other oral health-related practices and prevent dental caries in children aged 2–6 years through improving parental skills and self-efficacy.</p>

                <p>This is a cluster, parallel-group, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial of an online parenting intervention with four time points for data collection, that is, a 2 (online intervention vs education only) × 4 (time: baseline, 6 weeks, 6-month and 12-month follow-up) design for questionnaire-based assessment and a 2×3 (time: baseline, 12 and 18 months) for dental caries experience. This study will examine the effects of an online parenting intervention on children’s oral health-related practices (toothbrushing, sugar consumption and dental visits), dental caries experience, parenting practices while brushing their child’s teeth, strategies parents use to promote brushing and parents’ self-efficacy, knowledge and attitudes in relation to oral health of children, compared with a control group.</p>

                <title>Participants and recruitment</title>
                <p>Recruitment of participants will be conducted over a period of 6 months (May 2021 to October 2021). Parents or caregivers and children aged 2–6 years are recruited from randomly selected Child Care Centres (CCCs) of the Gold Coast. A list of CCCs in each tertile of socioeconomic disadvantage<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> was created. CCCs are then randomly selected and invited via email or phone to participate, and recruitment continues until the required number of CCCs is achieved. Centre-based CCCs that deliver typical long day care are considered for inclusion while those providing home-based care or family-based care are excluded. CCCs in each arm are pair-matched based on their tertile of socioeconomic disadvantage.</p>
                <p>Inclusion criteria for parents or caregivers are: having a child aged 2–6 years, being able to read and understand English, providing written informed consent and having access to a device (eg, smartphone, tablet or computer) with internet access. Only one parent and one child per family are eligible to participate. If a parent has more than one child in the eligible age range attending a selected CCC, they are asked to nominate the child whose oral health habits they are most concerned about. If they do not have concerns for one specific child, the youngest child is selected. Exclusion criteria are: child with a disability, child with behavioural difficulties for which parents are currently seeking professional help, and parents currently receiving psychological help or counselling for any reason.</p>
                <p>A parent-focused intervention in the past found an absolute increase from 59% to 89% in the number of children brushing their teeth twice daily.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, assuming an effect size of 0.30 with a type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.03,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and consent rate of six children from each selected CCC, six clusters per arm are required to detect a minimum difference of 29.6% in the primary outcome. This results in a sample size of 72 families (36 in each arm). Allowing for an overall attrition rate of 50%, 108 families (54 in each arm) and at least 6 in each cluster will be recruited. An additional CCC will be considered for each CCC that has a cluster size of less than six. We intend to allow for attrition of greater than the traditionally hypothesised 20%<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> due to the long assessment follow-up in a transient setting like a CCC: high attrition rates have been observed from past cluster randomised trials conducted in Australian CCC settings.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p>
                <p>Parents of children aged 2–6 years in the consenting CCCs receive information about the study via a printed information sheet or a notice in their Centre’s newsletter, or verbally from research staff attending the CCC during ‘pick-up’ hours. The notice in the newsletters directs parents to the study website where they can read the study information, register their interest in participating and consent to be contacted. Alternatively, parents can return a ‘consent to be contacted’ form to the CCC, or directly to the research team via email or text message, or via hardcopy returned to the researchers attending the CCC. Those providing ‘consent to be contacted’ are contacted by phone or email by a research staff member to assess their eligibility. Eligible parent participants are contacted again after a week to allow them time to discuss the research project with family members. Interested parents are invited to complete online consent (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>) and baseline questionnaires. Their child is examined for dental caries in the CCC in the presence of a childhood educator or parent. Parents are invited to attend their child’s caries examination appointment, but their presence is not mandatory. Verbal assent is obtained from children before conducting the oral examination at baseline and at each appointment by explaining their involvement in simple language. Appointments are postponed if a child appears distressed. After the baseline caries examination and completion of questionnaires, researchers meet parents’ face-to-face when they come to collect their children from the CCC. During this consultation, parents receive: a Bluetooth supported smart toothbrush and monthly toothbrushing charts. The research team helps the parents in setting up the mobile application on their smartphones. Families receive a phone call after 2 days to check that they have successfully downloaded the Oral B application and that their child has started using the toothbrush.</p>

                <p>After baseline surveys and caries assessments have been completed, each CCC is randomly allocated to the intervention or the control group in a 1:1 ratio using computer generated block randomisation by a member of the research team not involved in recruitment or data collection: this facilitates equal group allocation. Group allocation is stratified by the socioeconomic tertile (low, medium and high) of the location of the CCC. Participants in this study cannot be blinded to group allocation; however, the investigator responsible for caries outcome assessment is blinded to group allocation.</p>

                <title>Intervention and control</title>
                <p><italic toggle="yes">Healthy Habits Triple P - Oral health</italic> is designed to improve parenting practices and confidence related to children’s oral health-related behaviours (toothbrushing, snacking practices and dental visits), and thereby prevent dental caries in children. It is based on a social learning model to promote self-regulation in parents and children, which forms the theoretical basis of Triple P. Triple P is underpinned by five core principles of positive parenting: safe and engaging environment, positive learning environment, assertive discipline, realistic expectation and parental self-care.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> The focus of intervention delivery is on parents, not children, as children’s behaviour is seen to be directly influenced by parent behaviour. The intervention aims to increase parental self-regulation and positive parenting practices to promote child cooperation, consistent discipline and routine related to oral health practices. This programme is easy to use and engaging, and includes interactive features like video/audio clips, goal-setting activities, reminders and progress trackers. It is compatible for use on a smartphone, tablet or computer and consists of two modules. Module one focuses on general parenting principles and includes: strategies for encouraging healthy lifestyle behaviours; setting up and maintaining effective routines; preventing and dealing with children’s resistance; planning for high risk situations that may disrupt routines; building children’s independence in engaging in healthy lifestyle practices; coping with stressful situations; and finding appropriate evidence based information to support healthy lifestyles. The second module is oral health specific and focuses on the importance of starting oral health routines early, engaging in regular and effective toothbrushing, healthy approaches to snacking and drinks and strategies to ensure that visits to the dentist are regular and a positive experience for both parent and child. The online modules take 3–4 hours to complete but parents are encouraged to complete them at their own pace. Participants in the intervention group are encouraged to complete all the modules within 2 weeks of allocation. In between the 6-week and 18-month post-intervention assessments, parents receive monthly emails or phone call reminding them to follow their oral health-related habits plan.</p>

In addition, the respondents are asked about the ages at which their child first started brushing their teeth and had their first dental visit, and their own and their child’s general and oral health status.</p>
                <p>Questionnaires are administered online using the LimeSurvey platform, and the link to the survey is sent to the parent’s email at each follow-up time point. Parents requesting paper questionnaires receive them through the post and are asked to return the completed questionnaires to the researchers using a postage paid return envelope. Reminders for completing the follow-up questionnaires are sent through emails/text messages at each follow-up time point. All data related to primary and secondary outcomes, except dental caries, are collected at baseline, 6-week, 6-month and 12-month follow-up time points. Dental caries assessment are done at baseline, 12-month and 18-month follow-up time points (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Mean daily toothbrushing frequency and mean time spent on toothbrushing at each session are the primary outcomes of the study. Two sources are used to collect these data: powered toothbrushes and parent report. Data on toothbrushing frequency and time spent at each session are remotely collected through the Oral-B application installed on parents’ mobile devices, which stores the toothbrushing data transferred from Bluetooth-linked powered toothbrushes (Oral-B Genius 9000 electric toothbrushes). All the data collected through the Oral B application is stored on their self-built, secure cloud platform and complies with all standards and guidelines related to protecting customer data in Australia. Toothbrushing data along with the handle IDs (with no personally identifiable information) is provided to the research team on request, by Oral B researchers at each time point. Parent-reported toothbrushing information is collected every 3 months for a period of 12 months using a series of 3-month toothbrushing charts. Parents and/or children tick the chart after brushing in the morning and evening every day, and parents upload the image of the completed charts to the research team by scanning the QR code on the toothbrushing chart.</p>
