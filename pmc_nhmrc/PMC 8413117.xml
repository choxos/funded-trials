                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Decades of research indicate that when social connectedness is threatened, mental health is at risk. However, extant interventions to tackle loneliness have had only modest success, and none have been trialled under conditions of such threat.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>174 young people with depression and loneliness were randomised to one of two evidence-based treatments: cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or <sc>Groups 4 Health</sc> (<sc>G4H</sc>), an intervention designed to increase social group belonging. Depression, loneliness, and well-being outcomes were evaluated at one-year follow-up; COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed partway through follow-up assessments. This provided a quasi-experimental test of the utility of each intervention in the presence (lockdown group) and absence (control group) of a threat to social connectedness.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>At one-year follow-up, participants in lockdown reported significantly poorer wellbeing than controls who completed follow-up before lockdown, <italic>t</italic>(152)=2.41, <italic>p</italic>=.017. Although both CBT and <sc>G4H</sc> led to symptom improvement, the benefits of <sc>G4H</sc> were more robust following an unanticipated threat to social connectedness for depression (χ<sup>2</sup>(16)=31.35, <italic>p</italic>=.001), loneliness (χ<sup>2</sup>(8)=21.622, <italic>p</italic>=.006), and wellbeing (χ<sup>2</sup>(8)=22.938, <italic>p</italic>=.003).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Limitations</title>
                  <p>Because the COVID-19 lockdown was unanticipated, this analysis represents an opportunistic use of available data. As a result, we could not measure the specific impact of restrictions on participants, such as reduced income, degree of isolation, or health-related anxieties.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p><sc>G4H</sc> delivered one year prior to COVID-19 lockdown offered greater protection than CBT against relapse of loneliness and depression symptoms. Implications are discussed with a focus on how these benefits might be extended to other life stressors and transitions.</p>

          <body>
            <p id="para0010">Loneliness has been shown to be causally linked to poor mental health and is a source of significant distress in its own right (<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">Erzen and Çikrikci, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Recognition of the public health burden that this causes has been growing in recent years, prompting national policy and community initiatives. For example, in the United Kingdom, social prescribing programs have sought to connect people who experience loneliness to social groups in their local communities, typically through primary care providers (<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">Halder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">Wakefield et al., 2020</xref>). However, evidence for the efficacy of this and other loneliness interventions — whether focused on prevention or treatment — is not strong. Indeed, in their meta-analysis of loneliness interventions, <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">Masi and colleagues (2011)</xref> concluded that: “the most we can say is that these interventions achieve, at best, only modest improvement but not recovery”. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis found that interventions rarely target people with chronic loneliness specifically, or examine long-term outcomes (<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">Eccles and Qualter, 2020</xref>). This is problematic in light of loneliness being prone to relapse (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Cacioppo et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
            <p id="para0011">This disconnect between the prevalence of loneliness and our capacity to manage it has been brought into stark relief by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading the disease, many people around the world have experienced extended periods of isolation, either self-imposed or enforced by governments, which, unsurprisingly, have been associated with increased loneliness (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Groarke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Killgore et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that a new intervention, <sc>Groups 4 Health (G4H),</sc> can be effective in reducing loneliness in vulnerable samples. Across three published trials, this program was found to reduce loneliness compared to a matched no-treatment control group (<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Haslam et al., 2016</xref>), treatment as usual (<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">Haslam et al., 2019</xref>), and group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT; <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Cruwys et al., 2021</xref>) with large effects sizes in each trial.</p>
            <p id="para0012"><sc>G4H</sc> targets <italic>group-based belonging</italic> as the key mechanism through which loneliness can be overcome (<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Haslam et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). According to social identity theorising, loneliness is seen to arise from either the loss, or the lack, of important and meaningful group memberships and the social identities that arise from them (<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Cruwys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">Haslam et al., 2018</xref>). On this basis it is argued that increasing the number of a person's high-quality group memberships and associated identifications can be an antidote to loneliness and its associated health consequences (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Cruwys et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">Sani et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
            <p id="para0013">The social identity framework has paid particular attention to the role that external events, particularly those associated with life transitions, play in shaping loneliness and its sequelae. Speaking to this, the social identity model of identity change (SIMIC; <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Haslam, et al., 2021</xref>) explores the effects that life transitions can have on a person's group memberships and social identities. These transitions can be planned (e.g., pregnancy, retirement; <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Seymour-Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">Steffens et al., 2016</xref>) or unplanned (e.g., trauma, job loss; <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">Muldoon et al., 2019</xref>). Though very different, these events all have a distinct and often profound effect on a person's social environment — resulting in loss or change in the group memberships and identities that they value or are able to draw upon. According to SIMIC, it is these social changes that are fundamental to understanding a person's response to life transitions and their impact on well-being.</p>
            <p id="para0014">However, neither <sc>G4H</sc> nor other extant loneliness interventions have been evaluated in terms of their capacity to protect people against an unanticipated threat to social connectedness. Given that both life change and social isolation are recognised triggers for loneliness and, indeed, the onset or relapse of mental ill-health, this represents an important gap. To address this, the current study sought to evaluate the capacity of <sc>G4H</sc> to protect against loneliness and mental health decline in the context of an unanticipated and significant threat to social connectedness — the COVID-19 pandemic and associated government-imposed lockdowns. Here we explored our research question using existing data from a randomised control trial which compared <sc>G4H</sc> and CBT in a large sample of young Australians (aged 15-25) with a history of loneliness and depression. Approximately half the participants completed their 12-month follow-up assessment prior to mid-February 2020, while the remainder completed it during Australia's first COVID-19 lockdown period (April-June 2020). Restrictions during this period involved a stay-at-home order for all but essential workers and strict limits on movement outside of home (only for essential shopping and health needs). The former functioned as a control group and the latter as a quasi-experimental “lockdown” group.</p>
            <p id="para0015">This sample was particularly suitable for assessing our research question because in Australia, as in many countries, the lockdown measures had a more severe economic and social impact on young people than on other demographic groups (<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Dawel et al., 2020</xref>). There were two reasons for this. First, young people tended to be overrepresented in employment sectors most severely impacted by lockdown restrictions (e.g., retail, hospitality). Second, they were more likely to be employed casually, and emergency government subsidies implemented to support employees excluded most casual workers (<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">ATO, 2020</xref>). In addition, our sample were particularly vulnerable to the threat that lockdown posed to social connectedness and mental health because of their history of depression and loneliness, both of which follow a chronic course.</p>
            <p id="para0016">In this context, our research sought to test two hypotheses:<list list-type="simple" id="celist0002"><list-item id="celistitem0005"><label>H1</label><p id="para0017">The lockdown group would report worse mental health than the control group, as indexed by differences in wellbeing, depression, and loneliness.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0006"><label>H2</label><p id="para0018">Participants who completed <sc>G4H</sc> (vs. CBT) would have greater protection against the threats to social connectedness and mental health posed by lockdown, and report lower loneliness and depression and greater wellbeing at 12-month follow-up.</p></list-item></list>

                <p id="para0019">Participants were 174 people in a Phase 3 randomised controlled trial (described elsewhere, <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Cruwys et al., 2021</xref>) that sought to compare the long-term efficacy of <sc>G4H</sc> and CBT. In order to meet eligibility criteria for the trial, at baseline, all participants reported elevated levels of loneliness on the UCLA-20 (the minimum required score was 40 which is approximately 1 standard deviation above the population mean for adolescents), clinical symptoms of depression on the PHQ-9 (the minimum required score was 5 which represents mild clinical symptoms), and/or a diagnosed mental illness (28.7% of the sample). Young people were ineligible if they were receiving adjunct evidence-based treatment for depression (e.g., antidepressant medication; evidence-based psychotherapy), or had another severe mental illness that could not be managed appropriately in the group program (e.g., personality disorder, moderate-severe suicide risk). Participants were recruited from public and private mental health services, as well as via advertising in the wider community. Ethical approval was provided by Brisbane Metro South HREC/18/QPAH/54.</p>
                <p id="para0020">Participants were aged 15-25 years (<italic>M</italic>=19.00; <italic>SD</italic>=2.01), and were 74% female (see <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
for full demographic details). After providing informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to either <sc>G4H</sc> (<italic>n</italic>=84) or CBT (<italic>n</italic>=90).

; 75 people were due to complete their 12-month follow-up prior to mid-February 2020 (of which 68 responses were obtained), while 99 people were due to complete their 12-month follow-up in April-June 2020 during the period of national government-imposed lockdown (of which 91 responses were obtained). Although the trial was designed for another purpose (a non-inferiority trial), two features made it particularly suitable to answering our research question. First, participants were randomly assigned to either CBT or <sc>G4H</sc> and the trial had the same (pre-registered) recruitment strategy over time, meaning that participants who were recruited earlier versus later in the trial (and were thus completing their follow-ups in vs. before lockdown) should not differ at baseline except by chance. Second, unlike many threats to social connection, COVID lockdown was not anticipated by participants and therefore we can be confident that their responses to measures collected at the timepoints prior to lockdown should not differ between groups other than by chance. This quasi-experimental design (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Reichardt, 2009</xref>) allows us to capitalise on these features of the dataset to provide a strong test of the ability of <sc>G4H</sc> versus CBT to protect vulnerable young people against an unanticipated threat to their social connectedness.<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The quasi-experimental design of the study.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0001">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>

Differences between CBT and <sc>G4H</sc> at baseline were not evaluated statistically, in line with recommendations that this is inappropriate for RCT designs where any differences must arise due to chance (<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Assman et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

In Step 1 of the model, fixed effects were included for time (as a categorical variable), condition (<sc>G4H</sc> vs. CBT), and their interaction. The crucial test was in Step 2, which added fixed effects for the lockdown variable (control vs. lockdown) and its interactions with time and condition variables.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0035">A pandemic and its associated global economic, social, and community effects represent a significant stressor and threat to the wellbeing of the population at large. However, this is especially true for young people with a history of depression and loneliness for whom physical separation and lockdowns can be especially challenging (<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Dawel et al., 2020</xref>). It is thus remarkable that among these young people who had completed <sc>G4H</sc> one year prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, no significant differences were found between the lockdown and control groups on loneliness, wellbeing, or depression. In the context of <sc>G4H</sc> recipients showing substantial and sustained improvement in social connectedness and mental health from baseline, this suggests that <sc>G4H</sc> acted as an ‘inoculation’ for these vulnerable young people against an unanticipated threat to their social connectedness. In contrast, young people who completed the CBT program showed the predicted elevation in loneliness, depression symptoms, and reduced wellbeing during lockdown, relative to control participants who completed their follow-up assessments before lockdown.</p>
              <p id="para0036">Importantly, these findings do <italic>not</italic> suggest that CBT is ineffective or did not benefit participants. On the contrary, both <sc>G4H</sc> and CBT proved highly effective at reducing loneliness and depression relative to baseline, which was the key finding of the pre-registered Phase III trial that is reported elsewhere (<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Cruwys et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, the benefits that participants obtained from CBT were less <italic>robust</italic> to an unanticipated life change of the form brought about by COVID-19 and associated restrictions. It was in this context that <sc>G4H</sc> was particularly advantageous.</p>
              <sec id="sec0016">
                <label>3.1</label>
                <title>Implications</title>
                <p id="para0037">These findings speak to the potential utility of <sc>G4H</sc> as an intervention to ‘inoculate’ people against changes brought about by major life events. For instance, prior work has suggested that wellbeing is often compromised by events such as trauma, brain injury, or migration (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Haslam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2011</xref>). Even putatively positive events — such as starting university, becoming a mother, and transitioning to retirement — often threaten wellbeing, with a substantial minority of people struggling to adjust (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Cruwys et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2018</xref>). Prior research suggests that these difficulties are due, in large part, to the loss and change in the social groups and identities that life transitions entail. For this reason, an intervention that seeks to enhance the skills required to negotiate and manage group life (such as <sc>G4H</sc>) has particular appeal on both theoretical and practical grounds. Indeed, the current study provides the strongest empirical evidence to date that <sc>G4H</sc> is uniquely placed to protect people from becoming isolated and unwell in the face of unexpected life challenges.</p>
                <p id="para0038">These findings also highlight the need to conceptualise and evaluate mental health interventions through a lens that considers social and contextual threats to wellbeing. While it is certainly important to promote good mental health in times of ‘smooth sailing’, interventions might also seek to buffer people when ‘life gives you lemons’ — a scenario which, realistically, we will all experience. Rarely have intervention evaluations considered such events — not least because these are largely unplanned and hence difficult to study. However, large national datasets may provide opportunities to examine the effect of major societal events (e.g., <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Sibley and Bulbulia, 2012</xref>), and methods like those employed here could also be used more widely to shed light on the robustness of clinical interventions.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="para0039">This study had many strengths: its pre-COVID baseline for all participants, randomisation to intervention group, and the inclusion of a “control” group who completed 12-month follow-up prior to the pandemic restrictions and who were statistically indistinguishable to the lockdown group at baseline. However, there are also a number of limitations. The sample comprised young people, mostly female, and thus the findings are not necessarily generalisable beyond this demographic group. Furthermore, the present analysis represents an opportunistic use of available data. As a result, we do not have measures that quantify the specific impact of restrictions on participants, such as reduced income, degree of isolation, or health-related anxieties. Our lockdown group were all sampled in the earliest phase of the pandemic, when community solidarity tended to be strong (<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Cárdenas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">Reicher and Drury, 2021</xref>). Subsequent transmission waves and repeated lockdowns may well have further undermined wellbeing and led to more divergent trajectories. As previous work highlights, it seems likely that COVID-related experiences interact with individual vulnerabilities to influence outcomes (<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">Balestri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Jetten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Moccia et al., 2021</xref>), but these were not assessed in the present study.</p>
