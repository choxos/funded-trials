              <abstract>
                <p>Despite their low cost, the use of email invitations to distribute surveys to medical practitioners have been associated with lower response rates. This research compares the difference in response rates from using email approach plus online completion rather than a mailed invitation letter plus a choice of online or paper completion. A parallel randomised controlled trial was conducted during the 11<sup>th</sup> annual wave of the nationally representative Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) longitudinal survey of doctors. The control group was invited using a mailed paper letter (including a paper survey plus instructions to complete online) and three mailed paper reminders. The intervention group was approached in the same way apart from the second reminder when they were approached by email only. The primary outcome is the response rate and the statistical analysis was blinded. 18,247 doctors were randomly allocated to the control (9,125) or intervention group (9,127), with 9,108 and 9,107 included in the analysis. Using intention to treat analysis, the response rate in the intervention group was 35.92% compared to 37.59% in the control group, a difference of -1.66 percentage points (95% CI: -3.06 to -0.26). The difference was larger for General Practitioners (-2.76 percentage points, 95% CI: -4.65 to -0.87) compared to other specialists (-0.47 percentage points, 95% CI: -2.53 to 1.60). For those who supplied an email address, the average treatment effect on the treated was higher at -2.63 percentage points (95% CI: -4.50 to -0.75) for all physicians, -3.17 percentage points (95% CI: -5.83 to -0.53) for General Practitioners, and -2.1 percentage points (95% CI: -4.75 to 0.56) for other specialists. For qualified physicians, using email to invite participants to complete a survey leads to lower response rates compared to a mailed letter. Lower response rates need to be traded off with the lower costs of using email rather than mailed letters.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Web surveys have consistently lower response rates than all other survey modes [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Surveys of medical practitioners remain a key source of information about clinical practice, health service delivery, and clinical attitudes and experience. A key issue with survey data is that they can have low external validity because the sample may be less representative due to response bias caused by recruitment methods and non-random selection of physicians completing the survey. Although a low response rate does not necessarily mean low external validity [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the focus on response rates remains a key feature of the survey methods literature for physicians [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined different methods of increasing response rates in surveys of medical practitioner populations [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], such as changing features of survey design and delivering incentives. Email contact and online survey completion is popular as costs are lower but research has shown that response rates also tend to be lower, with a mailed approach more effective and recommended [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, in a meta-analysis of 48 studies of health professionals, three studies found that mailed surveys were associated with higher response rates than online/web modes, with no difference in response rates between online modes and mixed modes [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pit, Vo (6) conducted a systematic review of methods used to increase response rates for GPs, and found postal surveys were more effective than phone or email surveys (as a singular method of distribution), and a sequential mixed-mode of reminders was more effective than using online only or online and paper surveys concurrently. Beebe, Jacobson [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found that a sequential mixed mode (web followed by mail) survey of health professionals had a higher response rate than mail only but found no statistically significant differences between mail only and web only, though the sample sizes were small. No differences were found between web only, mail only, and mixed modes in a more recent randomised study of physicians [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Other key studies have examined mixed modes that compare combinations of mail and online approaches, but do not directly compare mail and online [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>Most studies used data generally more than 10 years old. As the use of email and the internet becomes more universal, including the more widespread use of electronic medical records, it is important to re-examine this issue. Nevertheless, for physician cohorts who are less familiar with the internet, mainly older physicians, there is uncertainty as to whether response rates would be different, and a risk that response rates will be lower with an email approach or online completion. Older people are less likely to respond to email than younger people [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and if a mailed approach is used and physicians are given the choice between paper or online competition, the latter is less likely for older physicians [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>The aim of this research is to compare response rates between an email approach and a mailed approach within a national longitudinal survey of physicians. More specifically, we introduce an email approach in the second of three reminders sent to non-responding physicians. In the first ten annual waves of the survey, the main mailout and all three reminders were delivered by mail only. Our null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in the response rate when delivering the reminder by email or mail.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>Reporting and design of the randomised trial are based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The study was approved by The University of Melbourne Faculty of Business and Economics Human Ethics Advisory Group (Ref. 0709559) and the Monash University Standing Committee on Ethics in Research Involving Humans (Ref: 195535 CF07/1102–2007000291). Participant consent was obtained through voluntarily completing the survey.</p>
              <sec id="sec003">
                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>The research was conducted within the context of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) survey. This was a longitudinal panel survey of all medical practitioners in Australia, collecting 11 annual waves of data from around 9,000 to 10,000 physicians per wave [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The original responders in Wave 1 (2008) were followed up annually, with the addition of a cohort of new doctors entering the sample frame from Wave 2 and each subsequent wave [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Each wave therefore had a mixture of doctors from different cohorts. Responses for each wave were gathered using a sequential mixed mode design based on an earlier RCT [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The MABEL survey is sent to all types of medical practitioners in Australia.</p>
                <p>The sample frame for MABEL is the Medical Directory of Australia, a national database of doctors held by the Australasian Medical Publishing Company (AMPCo). We use participants from Wave 11, administered between August 2018 and April 2019. Doctors were excluded if they had previously requested to withdraw from the MABEL survey, or who were known to be deceased. Junior doctors were excluded since in 2016 we conducted a small experiment that supported the use of an email approach for junior doctors and this was adopted in subsequent waves for this group only [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
                <p>The invitation included a mailed letter that contained unique log in details for online completion to enable longitudinal tracking, as well as a paper copy of the survey which included a unique username printed on the cover. Respondents could choose the mode of completion. The first reminder used a mailed paper letter containing instructions for online completion but no paper survey. The second reminder used a mailed letter with instructions for online completion and included a paper copy of the survey. The third reminder included only a mailed paper letter with instructions for online completion.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec004">
                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The mailout for the intervention groups included an email approach for the second reminder. Both the intervention and control group were approached four times: the initial invitation plus three reminders. In the control group all four approaches used a mailed paper letter sent to each participant’s work address. All survey materials are available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.mabel.org.au" ext-link-type="uri">www.mabel.org.au</ext-link>.</p>
                <p>The intervention group only differed at the second reminder, where they were approached by email and could only complete online, receiving no paper letter or paper copy of the survey. The comparison between the intervention and control group therefore includes a different method of approach and a different method of completion: email approach plus online completion versus mailed approach plus a choice of online or paper completion. The email included the same text as the paper letter plus a link and instructions for online completion. Emails were sent to email addresses from the AMPCo database or from email addresses provided by participants in earlier waves of the survey.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome for this study is the response rate at end of recruitment. A medical practitioner was considered to have responded if they returned their survey (via mail or completing online) with Section A completed which included questions on whether they were currently participating in clinical practice and at least one question answered from Section B. Surveys returned blank were counted as refusals to participate. The response rate was calculated as the total number of responses divided by the total number of surveys distributed (minus surveys that could not be sent by the mailing house because the doctor was deceased or had no valid mailing address).</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec006">
                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The sample for the trial included 18,247 GPs and non-GP specialists eligible to be invited to complete a survey in Wave 11. This included, i) 13,382 doctors who had previously completed at least one MABEL survey since 2008 (defined as a continuing doctor), ii) a cohort of 1,862 doctors new to the sample frame in 2018, and iii) 3,003 doctors from a ‘boost’ sample comprising a 10% random sample of those who had never responded to an invitation to participate in MABEL. The total sample size of 18,247 doctors is sufficient to detect a two-sided difference of least two percentage points in the response rate (alpha 0.05 and power 0.8). This assumes a response rate of 42.4% in the control group (an estimate from Wave 10 of MABEL).</p>

              <sec id="sec007">
                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>A parallel-arm design with 1:1 allocation was used, with 18,247 doctors randomly allocated to either the control or intervention group. Allocation was stratified by doctor type (GP, specialist), continuing or new, and boost sample to ensure the proportions of these groups of doctors in the intervention and control groups were the same. This is important because new doctors and boost sample doctors are likely to have lower response rates, and specialists had higher response rates than GPs in previous waves. We tested a two-sided hypothesis as it was unclear, a priori, whether the intervention group would have a higher or lower response rate. Randomisation was performed using the <italic toggle="yes">sample</italic> command in Stata 15.1 statistical software<sup>15</sup>.</p>
                <p>Randomisation took place (by TT) before the first invitation for Wave 11 was mailed out in August 2018. Group allocation was kept separate (in a separate electronic data file) from the main mailout and the first reminder so researchers handling the responses and reminders were blinded to group allocation during this process. The second reminder was prepared in late November 2018 by TT. The list of those eligible for a second reminder was then merged with the file containing the intervention and control group identifiers to indicate who should receive an email. A separate file indicating whether doctors had an email address was also merged onto this file. AMPCo was sent a list of doctor identifiers indicating if they should be approached using a mailed letter or an email.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>The analysis was conducted by BH who was blinded to group allocation until after the analysis was complete and checked, and who was not involved in the randomisation or any data collection. Baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups are compared with each other, and with the population of medical practitioners in Australia. The main analysis was based on intention to treat, which estimates the average treatment effect (ATE).</p>
                <p>The proportions responding in each group were compared using a 2x2 table and Pearson chi-squared test. An adjusted analysis was also conducted using multivariable logistic regression to examine the probability of response between the two groups after adjusting for covariates. Sub-group analysis was also conducted using separate logistic regressions for GPs and other specialists. Covariates included age, gender, whether qualified overseas, quartiles of the socio-economic status of patients in each respondent’s postcode (measured using the Socio-Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), and the proportion of the population in the postcode over 65 years old and under 5 years old. Finally, the rurality of work location was measured using the Modified Monash Model (MMM) classification [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Major cities (MMM1), areas within 20km of town with 50,000 population (MMM2); areas within 15km of town with 15,000 to 50,000 population (MMM3); areas within 10km of town with 5,000 to 15,000 population (MMM4); MMM5-7 (all other remote and rural areas) are grouped with MM4 for the analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
                <p>A proportion of doctors allocated to the intervention and control group did not supply a valid email address to AMPCo. These will be allocated equally across intervention and control groups. Those who did not supply an email address in the intervention group cannot adhere to their allocated group and were instead approached by mailed paper letter rather than email. The intention to treat analysis includes these in the intervention group. This is appropriate as it assumes that in practice not all doctors are willing to provide email addresses and so the main results are applicable to the population of doctors whether or not they are willing to supply an email address.</p>
                <p>However, this will lead to an underestimate of the effect of the intervention for those who actually received an email compared to those in the control group who also received email. In addition to calculating the results using intention to treat analysis, we therefore calculate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET). This compares those who had a valid email address in both the intervention and control group.</p>

              <p>A comparison of the sample used in the trial and the population of GPs and specialists in clinical practice in 2018 shows that the trial sample was more likely to be female, are slightly younger, less likely to be from New South Wales, more likely to be from a non-metropolitan area. The proportion who are a specialist, the socio-economic status of the population, and the proportion of the population aged under 5 and over 65 years old are similar (<xref rid="pone.0289628.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Descriptive statistics comparing the characteristics of the intervention and control groups are shown in Tables <xref rid="pone.0289628.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0289628.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The flow diagram in <xref rid="pone.0289628.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> shows each step of the study and how the final sample was determined. Comparison of response rates are shown in <xref rid="pone.0289628.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, overall and for the subgroups of GPs and non-GP specialists. The response rate in the intervention group was 35.92% compared to 37.59% in the control group, a difference of -1.66 percentage points (95% CI: -3.06 to -0.26). After adjustment for covariates, this increases to -1.93 (95% CI: -3.36 to -0.50). The difference was larger for GPs (-2.76 percentage points, 95% CI: -4.65 to -0.87) compared to non-GP specialists (-0.47 percentage points, 95% CI: -2.53 to 1.60).</p>

This analysis compares only those who were approached by email in the intervention group to those in the control who had supplied an email address but were approached by mailed letter. Of those who were sent a second reminder in the intervention group, 43% (2840/6605) did not have an email address compared to 43.8% (2866/6540) in the control group. The overall ATET is larger compared to the ITT effect (-2.63 percentage points, 95% CI: -4.50 to -0.75), as well as for GPs (-3.17 percentage points, 95% CI: -5.83 to -0.53) and specialists (-2.10 percentage points, 95% CI: -4.75 to 0.56). The overall difference falls to 2.37 percentage points after adjustment for covariates.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Using email to approach potential survey subjects is often preferred because of its low cost. It is likely to have gained popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic given issues with collecting survey data using face-to-face interviews. Several studies have shown that in surveys of physicians an emailed approach can lead to lower response rates, potentially increasing response bias and reducing external validity. This is also the case in other populations [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, these studies are of specific samples and most are over 10 years old. One might assume that since then the use of email, familiarity with the internet, and online survey completion should have become more familiar to physician populations.</p>
              <p>Our results confirm that, in a nationally representative population of qualified GPs and non-GP specialists, response rates are lower using an emailed approach. The finding of a 1.93 percentage point fall in the response rate is from the ITT analysis and so is relevant to physician populations approached initially by mail, or where it is unknown a priori if they have an email address. The ATET of a 2.37 percentage point fall in the response rate is relevant to physician populations where only an email address is available to researchers, and so for physicians willing to supply an email address. The fall in response rate is higher for GPs than for non-GP specialists. The effect size seems quite small possibly because the control group, though approached by mail, still had the option of completing the survey online given the mixed mode of survey completion available to them. Our estimates are therefore conservative compared to using mail by itself. Our results are, more relevant to surveys using mixed modes of delivery.</p>
              <p>Weaver et al. (2019) randomised around 1,200 physicians in Minnesota and found a web-only response rate of 15.2% compared to 18.9% in the mail-only mode (3.7 percentage points), slightly higher than in our study. They also compared mixed modes (web-mail and mail-web) so the sample sizes in the web-only and mail-only groups were relatively small and so this difference was not statistically significant. Beebe et al., (2018) randomised 686 physicians, nurses and physician assistants and found a response rate of 38.2% for web only compared to 32.1% for mail only after two reminders, a slightly higher effect size (4.1 percentage points) and in the opposite direction of our results. However, again this difference was not statistically significant.</p>
              <p>The results should also be interpreted in the context of our longitudinal study that the first 10 annual waves combined a mixed mode of completion with a single method of approach using a mailed paper letter for the main mailout and three reminders. The intervention changed the method of approach to email for the second reminder. We used the second reminder, rather than the first mailout, to avoid a potentially large fall in the total number of responses if email was worse than mail. In the second reminder fewer respondents in total would be included in the trial. We do not think that the percentage difference in response rates would be any different if the intervention was for the first mailing or the first or the third reminder. At the second reminder, the intervention group were approached by email and could only complete the survey online, whilst the control group were approached by mailed letter that included a paper copy of the survey and so had a choice of online or paper copy completion. A limitation is that we are not just comparing differences in the method of approach. Though the control group were approached by mail, they could choose online or paper completion, and so their response rate might be lower if they could complete only online or higher if they could only complete using paper. For those who responded, there is evidence that those in the intervention group were more likely to complete the survey online, presumably because this group were approached by email in the second reminder. In the ITT analysis, 46.1% of control group responded online compared to 52.0% in the intervention group (<xref rid="pone.0289628.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the ATET analysis of those who supplied an email address, 48.1% in the control group completed the survey online compared to 71.3% in the intervention group.</p>
              <p>The study was conducted exclusively within the Australian context, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other countries with different healthcare systems, professional cultures, and survey response patterns. It would be beneficial to conduct similar studies in other countries to better understand how the intervention is performed in different settings. In addition, we have not examined differences in non-response bias which could arise if those who are more likely to respond to email are different in unobserved ways and this changes the composition of the doctors who respond, e.g. younger doctors are likely to respond to email. Our previous research in the same context has shown mixed modes (mail-online and online-mail) showed evidence of response bias, and that young, male doctors working in remote areas are more likely to complete the online survey [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our definition of a complete response of at least one question answered from Section B is quite conservative compared to what is generally recommended in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, some responses to current working status (Section A in the survey), such as ‘retired’ or ‘not working in clinical practice’ meant that respondents were not required to complete the rest of the survey or were directed to complete only certain sections of the survey, e.g demographics. Nevertheless, for respondents who answered at least one question from Section B, item response rates are over 90% for all sections of the survey across all 11 waves [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>As we were uncertain about the impact of email on response rates, we took a cautious approach by not using email in the first and main mailout but chose to use email in the second reminder where potential adverse impacts on overall response rate would be minimised. Our results are therefore conservative estimates of the impact of using an email approach versus mailed paper letter. If the intervention was delivered during the main mailout, the statistical power would have been higher. Although we do have a pilot survey every year and could have tested our hypothesis using the pilot sample of around 2000 doctors, the sample size in the pilot was not large enough and most pilot responses are merged into in the main wave if the surveys do not change so still count towards the main response rate.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The use of an emailed approach and online completion avoids printing and postage costs and the costs of manual data entry for those who responded to the second reminder. However, the lower response rates means that costs increase for the third mailed reminder as a higher number of participants needed to be approached. It remains unclear what advice to provide researchers as one might be willing to accept a lower response rate if costs are also lower. Often budgets for such surveys are very limited and email is the only option. In this case, optimising other survey characteristics (e.g. survey length) that can increase response rates is important using existing evidence [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and new research in the context of physicians. In addition, qualitative research is helpful to better understand response behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0289628.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, we do recommend that researchers attempt to negotiate larger budgets for physician surveys to ensure that mailed paper letters are used where possible so that survey responses are externally valid. This is necessary to be able to make valid recommendations from survey research. Further research should test a mix of methods to approach potential respondents, with appropriate sample size calculations, and where the same subjects are approached by email as well as mailed letter or other types of contact such as text messaging and social media, though these methods might be less effective in older physician populations.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: I have several concerns about the current study such that I cannot recommend it for publication at PLOS one.</p>
              <p>First, the topic is about a survey method, and it is comparing existing methods (online vs. letter recruitment for survey) rather than an innovative method. The sample size is restricted to be physicians, and the effect that was found is extremely small (i.e., a difference in about 2% response rate) albeit significant, and it is confirming previous findings. Given these, I think this study is more suitable for a specialized journal on survey methods.</p>
              <p>Second, the study was “administered between August 2018 and April 2019” I don’t know what the policy of PLOS-one is about this issue, but some journals do not accept results from surveys that are more than 3 years old. Furthermore, given that the motivation for the current study is that similar studies use more than 10-year-old data and the authors argued for an increase in internet usage. As we all know a lot of things happened since April of 2019 with emails and zoom meetings serving as essential tools in our society, so I am not sure whether the current results can be treated as up-to-date findings.</p>
              <p>Third, the methods are idiosyncratic in that the main manipulation took place only during the second reminder after the recruitment took place over mails and the letter reminder. To quote the authors, “More specifically, we introduce an email approach in the second of three reminders sent to non-responding physicians. In the first ten annual waves of the survey, the main mailout and all three reminders were delivered by mail only.” What was the reason that this specific mixed method was used for the study? Are there any empirical or theoretical basis to suggest that this method would be the best? In the discussion, the authors acknowledge these as potential limitations, and I think these limitations seriously compromise the generalizability of the findings.</p>
              <p>Fourth, it is unclear what the outcome measures; are they response rates only after the second reminder or after the first reminder? It sounds like it is the response rate regardless of the timepoint, and this can be an issue as noted in the next point.</p>
              <p>Fifth, the results reported in the abstract and as the main findings included data from two third of the participants in the intervention group who did not even receive the experimental treatment because they did not even have valid email addresses! These data should not even be reported. The authors also report results from those who had email addresses in both the intervention and control groups, and the response rates of both groups among these people are reduced from mid- to high thirty percent of the overall response rates down to low 20’s. Could it be the case that those who provided email addresses were more likely to have responded even before the manipulation?</p>
              <p>Other less major questions:</p>
              <p>Was the survey anonymous? If so, how was the online completion tracked in terms of which condition they belonged? If the survey responses had identifiers, couldn’t that be a factor that might compromise the generalizability of the findings?</p>
              <p>First sentence of Background; “Web surveys have lower response rates than other survey modes.” This is a strong statement and perhaps incorrect given the findings of the current study. Also, what are “other survey modes”?</p>
              <p>“…and this study also included nurses and physician assistants as well as physicians” This can sound somewhat politically incorrect as if nurses and physician assistants’ results are meaningless.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The article provides an important contribution regarding surveys and data collection. It makes a good point, indicating that most of the studies in this area are ten years old and thus requires an update. It utilizes sound statistical methods and contributes to existing literature.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Overall, the paper is well-structured, and the research question is clearly defined. The authors aim to compare the response rates between email and mailed approaches within a national longitudinal survey of physicians. I agree with the authors that this paper is up to date, considering that most studies in this area use data more than 10 years old, which justifies the need to re-examine this issue. The methods used in the study are robust and well-described, following the CONSORT guidelines and using appropriate statistical methods.</p>
              <p>The paper provides a clear comparison of response rates between the intervention and control groups, as well as subgroups of GPs and non-GP specialists. The results indicate that the response rate was lower for the email approach compared to the mailed approach. This difference was larger for GPs compared to non-GP specialists.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the paper contributes valuable insights to the survey methods literature for physicians, particularly in the context of the increasing use of email and the internet in medical practice. The findings have practical implications for survey design and recruitment methods targeting physicians.</p>
              <p>Strengths:</p>
              <p>1. The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, which ensures transparent and accurate reporting of the research process.</p>
              <p>2. The research was conducted within the context of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) survey, a well-established longitudinal panel survey of all medical practitioners in Australia, providing a strong foundation for the study.</p>
              <p>3. The sample frame for MABEL, the Medical Directory of Australia, is a national database of doctors, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the medical practitioner population.</p>
              <p>4. The study used a randomized controlled trial with a parallel-arm design and 1:1 allocation, which allows for a rigorous comparison between the intervention and control groups.</p>
              <p>5. The researchers employed stratified randomization to ensure that the proportions of different doctor types (GP, specialist), continuing or new, and boost sample in the intervention and control groups were the same.</p>
              <p>6. The analysis was conducted by a researcher who was blinded to group allocation until after the analysis was complete and checked, reducing the risk of bias.</p>
              <p>Weaknesses:</p>
              <p>1. The study relied on data from Wave 11, which was administered between August 2018 and April 2019, limiting the generalizability of the findings to more recent years.</p>
              <p>2. The study excluded junior doctors, who might have different response rates and preferences compared to more experienced doctors, reducing the generalizability of the findings.</p>
              <p>3. A significant proportion of the intervention group (43%) did not have an email address and were instead approached by mailed paper letter, which might underestimate the effect of the intervention for those who received an email.</p>
              <p>4. The intervention only differed at the second reminder, which may not have been enough to fully capture the difference in response rates between email and mailed approaches.</p>
              <p>5. The response rate differences between the intervention and control groups might be influenced by other factors not considered in the study, such as the timing of reminders and the content of the survey.</p>
              <p>Suggestions for improvement:</p>
              <p>1. The authors could consider updating the study with more recent data to ensure the relevance of the findings to current survey methods and physician response rates.</p>
              <p>2. To further assess the generalizability of the findings, the authors could include junior doctors in the sample (for future work) and analyze their response rates separately, providing insights into different age groups and experience levels.</p>
              <p>3. The researchers could explore additional ways to improve email deliverability and reduce the proportion of participants without an email address to better assess the intervention's effectiveness.</p>
              <p>4. The intervention could be extended to more than one reminder stage to better understand the cumulative effect of using email approaches over multiple reminders.</p>
              <p>5. The authors could conduct sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of other factors, such as timing of reminders and survey content, on response rates in both intervention and control groups. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing physician response rates.</p>
              <p>6. Limited generalizability across different populations: The study was conducted exclusively within the Australian context, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other countries with different healthcare systems, professional cultures, and survey response patterns. It would be beneficial to conduct similar studies in other countries to better understand how the intervention is performed in different settings.</p>
              <p>7. Lack of examination of non-response bias: The study focused on response rates but did not explore potential non-response bias, which may arise if the doctors who chose to participate in the survey differ systematically from those who did not. It is important to investigate whether the intervention affected the composition of respondents in any way, as this may have implications for the interpretation of the survey results and their representativeness of the target population.</p>
              <p>8. Limited exploration of factors influencing email effectiveness: The study did not investigate factors that could influence the effectiveness of email approaches, such as the timing of the email, subject lines, or the formatting of the email content. A more detailed investigation of these factors could help identify best practices for optimizing email reminders in future survey administration.</p>
              <p>9. Single intervention approach: The study tested only one email-based intervention, which may not represent the full range of potential interventions that could be implemented to improve response rates. Future research could explore other interventions, such as varying the incentives for participation or using different communication channels, to determine the most effective strategies for increasing response rates.</p>
              <p>10. No qualitative insights: The study did not provide any qualitative insights into the reasons behind the observed response rate differences between the intervention and control groups. Conducting interviews or focus groups with a subset of physicians could help researchers better understand the reasons for their survey participation preferences, which could inform future survey design and administration strategies.</p>
              <p>11. Provide more information on the implications of their findings for healthcare and survey research communities.</p>
              <p>12. Address the study's limitations in more detail and discuss potential ways to overcome them in future research.</p>
              <p>13. Elaborate on the practical implications of their findings, such as cost savings, logistical benefits, and challenges or barriers to implementing email reminders.</p>
              <p>14. Clearly outline the next steps needed for future research to build upon the current study and address its limitations.</p>
              <p>Writing Quality, Understanding Easiness, Clarity, and Organization:</p>
              <p>- Overall, the writing quality of the paper seems to be good, with clear descriptions of the methods, results, and conclusions. The organization appears logical, with sections following a conventional structure for a research article.</p>
              <p>- Suggestions for improvement:</p>
              <p>a) Some portions of the text, particularly in the Methods section, could be further clarified for better readability. Consider rephrasing complex sentences and providing more straightforward explanations of the study design and data analysis.</p>
              <p>b) In the Introduction and Discussion sections, the authors could provide more context on the importance of their research question and the implications of their findings for the broader healthcare and survey research communities.</p>
              <p>Content Accuracy, Comprehensiveness, Clinical Usefulness, and Significance:</p>
              <p>- The content appears accurate, and the methodology is comprehensive. However, some concerns have been raised regarding the study's limitations, which could impact the clinical usefulness and significance of the findings.</p>
              <p>- Suggestions for improvement:</p>
              <p>a) Address the weaknesses mentioned in previous comments, such as the limited generalizability of the study, potential non-response bias, and factors influencing email effectiveness.</p>
              <p>b) Explore additional intervention approaches, such as varying incentives for participation, using different communication channels, or incorporating personalized messaging to identify the most effective strategies for increasing response rates.</p>
              <p>c) Consider conducting a qualitative investigation to understand the reasons behind physicians' survey participation preferences, which could inform future survey design and administration strategies.</p>
              <p>d) Provide a more in-depth literature review to better contextualize the study within the broader research landscape and identify gaps in current knowledge.</p>
              <p>e) Discuss the practical implications of the study findings, including potential cost savings or logistical benefits of using email reminders, as well as any challenges or barriers to implementation.</p>
              <p>f) Include a more detailed description of the target population and the representativeness of the sample to help readers understand the context and relevance of the study findings.</p>
              <p>g) Present a clear plan for future research, outlining the next steps needed to build upon the current study and address its limitations.</p>

              <p>Response to reviewers comments</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: I have several concerns about the current study such that I cannot recommend it for publication at PLOS one.</p>
              <p>First, the topic is about a survey method, and it is comparing existing methods (online vs. letter recruitment for survey) rather than an innovative method. The sample size is restricted to be physicians, and the effect that was found is extremely small (i.e., a difference in about 2% response rate) albeit significant, and it is confirming previous findings. Given these, I think this study is more suitable for a specialized journal on survey methods.</p>
              <p>*Survey methods are essential to all applied researchers, and response rates are feature of many any studies and surveys undertaking primary data collection, especially collecting data from health care providers. The size of a treatment effect should not influence publication otherwise this leads to publication bias. We think the context of our study is innovative given the increasing complexity of survey design and administration.</p>
              <p>Second, the study was “administered between August 2018 and April 2019” I don’t know what the policy of PLOS-one is about this issue, but some journals do not accept results from surveys that are more than 3 years old. Furthermore, given that the motivation for the current study is that similar studies use more than 10-year-old data and the authors argued for an increase in internet usage. As we all know a lot of things happened since April of 2019 with emails and zoom meetings serving as essential tools in our society, so I am not sure whether the current results can be treated as up-to-date findings.</p>
              <p>*The pandemic caused a delay in publication of this research and so we should not be disadvantaged by this. We agree that the pandemic may have changed people’s preferences towards online communication away from face to face (we now mention this at the beginning of the discussion), but both alternatives in our study (mail and email) should not have been affected by this as both do not require face to face contact. We did not compare email with the use of face-to face interviews, which might then have affected the generalisability of our results post-pandemic.</p>
              <p>Third, the methods are idiosyncratic in that the main manipulation took place only during the second reminder after the recruitment took place over mails and the letter reminder. To quote the authors, “More specifically, we introduce an email approach in the second of three reminders sent to non-responding physicians. In the first ten annual waves of the survey, the main mailout and all three reminders were delivered by mail only.” What was the reason that this specific mixed method was used for the study? Are there any empirical or theoretical basis to suggest that this method would be the best? In the discussion, the authors acknowledge these as potential limitations, and I think these limitations seriously compromise the generalizability of the findings.</p>
              <p>*As noted, we acknowledge these limitations in the discussion and add to the text to highlight that the percentage difference in response rates should not be any different if we implemented the intervention in the first mailout, 1st reminder or third reminder. We have also noted in the text that we used the second reminder to avoid a large fall in the total number of responses if email was worse than mail. In the second reminder fewer respondents in total would be included in the trial.</p>
              <p>Fourth, it is unclear what the outcome measures; are they response rates only after the second reminder or after the first reminder? It sounds like it is the response rate regardless of the timepoint, and this can be an issue as noted in the next point.</p>
              <p>*Yes the outcomes are the final response rates at the end of recruitment. We have added text to p6 to make this clear.</p>
              <p>Fifth, the results reported in the abstract and as the main findings included data from two third of the participants in the intervention group who did not even receive the experimental treatment because they did not even have valid email addresses! These data should not even be reported. The authors also report results from those who had email addresses in both the intervention and control groups, and the response rates of both groups among these people are reduced from mid- to high thirty percent of the overall response rates down to low 20’s. Could it be the case that those who provided email addresses were more likely to have responded even before the manipulation?</p>
              <p>*Excluding this group would bias the results and make them less generalisable to a real world setting when email addresses are not always available. This was an intention to treat analysis with the intervention occurring at the second reminder. Not having access to email is what happens in real world settings and so provides more generalisable results relevant to the population of doctors. Those who provided email addresses could be more likely to respond, but randomisation ensures the pre-intervention propensity to respond and the pre-intervention proportion with an email address are the same in the intervention and control groups.</p>
              <p>Other less major questions:</p>
              <p>Was the survey anonymous? If so, how was the online completion tracked in terms of which condition they belonged? If the survey responses had identifiers, couldn’t that be a factor that might compromise the generalizability of the findings?</p>
              <p>*All MABEL survey waves were not anonymous – this is necessary in longitudinal surveys that track respondents over time. Respondents were tracked as usual as part of the longitudinal survey. For the online version of the survey, respondents were required to log in with their unique username and password. Paper versions of surveys had their username printed on the front of each survey. Text has been added/moved on p5.</p>
              <p>First sentence of Background; “Web surveys have lower response rates than other survey modes.” This is a strong statement and perhaps incorrect given the findings of the current study. Also, what are “other survey modes”?</p>
              <p>*This is a strong statement because it comes from a large systematic review whose results are unambiguous. Other modes include face to face, mail, telephone, and email. We have clarified the text in this sentence. </p>
              <p>“…and this study also included nurses and physician assistants as well as physicians” This can sound somewhat politically incorrect as if nurses and physician assistants’ results are meaningless.</p>
              <p>*We have modified the text here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The article provides an important contribution regarding surveys and data collection. It makes a good point, indicating that most of the studies in this area are ten years old and thus requires an update. It utilizes sound statistical methods and contributes to existing literature.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Overall, the paper is well-structured, and the research question is clearly defined. The authors aim to compare the response rates between email and mailed approaches within a national longitudinal survey of physicians. I agree with the authors that this paper is up to date, considering that most studies in this area use data more than 10 years old, which justifies the need to re-examine this issue. The methods used in the study are robust and well-described, following the CONSORT guidelines and using appropriate statistical methods.</p>
              <p>The paper provides a clear comparison of response rates between the intervention and control groups, as well as subgroups of GPs and non-GP specialists. The results indicate that the response rate was lower for the email approach compared to the mailed approach. This difference was larger for GPs compared to non-GP specialists.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the paper contributes valuable insights to the survey methods literature for physicians, particularly in the context of the increasing use of email and the internet in medical practice. The findings have practical implications for survey design and recruitment methods targeting physicians.</p>
              <p>Strengths:</p>
              <p>1. The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, which ensures transparent and accurate reporting of the research process.</p>
              <p>2. The research was conducted within the context of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) survey, a well-established longitudinal panel survey of all medical practitioners in Australia, providing a strong foundation for the study.</p>
              <p>3. The sample frame for MABEL, the Medical Directory of Australia, is a national database of doctors, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the medical practitioner population.</p>
              <p>4. The study used a randomized controlled trial with a parallel-arm design and 1:1 allocation, which allows for a rigorous comparison between the intervention and control groups.</p>
              <p>5. The researchers employed stratified randomization to ensure that the proportions of different doctor types (GP, specialist), continuing or new, and boost sample in the intervention and control groups were the same.</p>
              <p>6. The analysis was conducted by a researcher who was blinded to group allocation until after the analysis was complete and checked, reducing the risk of bias.</p>
              <p>Weaknesses:</p>
              <p>1. The study relied on data from Wave 11, which was administered between August 2018 and April 2019, limiting the generalizability of the findings to more recent years.</p>
              <p>*COVID delayed the publication of this paper, and the COVID years. There is no a priori reason to suggest that the results are less relevant inn2023. COVID might have changed preferences for the use internet/email away from face to face, but our intervention did not compare with face to face survey completion.</p>
              <p>2. The study excluded junior doctors, who might have different response rates and preferences compared to more experienced doctors, reducing the generalizability of the findings.</p>
              <p>*Yes this correct – our findings are generalisable only to qualified GPs and specialists.</p>
              <p>3. A significant proportion of the intervention group (43%) did not have an email address and were instead approached by mailed paper letter, which might underestimate the effect of the intervention for those who received an email.</p>
              <p>*Yes – we have accounted for this by also conducting the analysis excluding those without email addresses (the average treatment effect on the treated) where the treatment effect is slightly higher.</p>
              <p>4. The intervention only differed at the second reminder, which may not have been enough to fully capture the difference in response rates between email and mailed approaches.</p>
              <p>*See response to Reviewer 1. A smaller total number of respondents are exposed to the intervention at the second reminder. We believe this would not have influenced the size of the percentage change in response rates between intervention and control, but would have led to lower power to detect a difference (pp14-15). However, our sample size calculation meant that we had sufficient power. </p>
              <p>5. The response rate differences between the intervention and control groups might be influenced by other factors not considered in the study, such as the timing of reminders and the content of the survey.</p>
              <p>*This is correct - however randomisation ensured these were the same in the intervention and control groups.</p>
              <p>Suggestions for improvement:</p>
              <p>1. The authors could consider updating the study with more recent data to ensure the relevance of the findings to current survey methods and physician response rates.</p>
              <p>*This is not possible as the last wave of the survey was in 2018-19.</p>
              <p>2. To further assess the generalizability of the findings, the authors could include junior doctors in the sample (for future work) and analyze their response rates separately, providing insights into different age groups and experience levels.</p>
              <p>*Junior doctors were not included in the randomisation as we focused only on more senior doctors. We will consider this for further research.</p>
              <p>3. The researchers could explore additional ways to improve email deliverability and reduce the proportion of participants without an email address to better assess the intervention's effectiveness.</p>
              <p>*Noted.</p>
              <p>4. The intervention could be extended to more than one reminder stage to better understand the cumulative effect of using email approaches over multiple reminders.</p>
              <p>*Yes we could have used email in all reminders as an intervention. There are various types of mixed mode that can be used.</p>
              <p>5. The authors could conduct sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of other factors, such as timing of reminders and survey content, on response rates in both intervention and control groups. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing physician response rates.</p>
              <p>*We have another paper more generally examining factors influencing response rates. Our study was focused on the specific intervention and other factors were held constant because of randomisation.</p>

              <p>6. Limited generalizability across different populations: The study was conducted exclusively within the Australian context, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other countries with different healthcare systems, professional cultures, and survey response patterns. It would be beneficial to conduct similar studies in other countries to better understand how the intervention is performed in different settings.</p>
              <p>*We have included this as a limitation in the discussion on p15.</p>
              <p>7. Lack of examination of non-response bias: The study focused on response rates but did not explore potential non-response bias, which may arise if the doctors who chose to participate in the survey differ systematically from those who did not. It is important to investigate whether the intervention affected the composition of respondents in any way, as this may have implications for the interpretation of the survey results and their representativeness of the target population.</p>
              <p>*This is an important issue if those who prefer email differ systematically from those who do not, and if these factors are also correlated with specific study outcomes (e.g. difference in job satisfaction for example). We have acknowledged this possibility but also cited evidence form our previous research using MABEL that examined response rates and response bias (p15). This found that response bias could be an issue depending on the specific study objectives. </p>
              <p>8. Limited exploration of factors influencing email effectiveness: The study did not investigate factors that could influence the effectiveness of email approaches, such as the timing of the email, subject lines, or the formatting of the email content. A more detailed investigation of these factors could help identify best practices for optimizing email reminders in future survey administration.</p>
              <p>*This was not an objective of our study, but we have noted this in the conclusion as an option for further research (p16).</p>
              <p>9. Single intervention approach: The study tested only one email-based intervention, which may not represent the full range of potential interventions that could be implemented to improve response rates. Future research could explore other interventions, such as varying the incentives for participation or using different communication channels, to determine the most effective strategies for increasing response rates.</p>
              <p>*As above – we have acknowledged this in the conclusions as an area of further research (p16).</p>
              <p>10. No qualitative insights: The study did not provide any qualitative insights into the reasons behind the observed response rate differences between the intervention and control groups. Conducting interviews or focus groups with a subset of physicians could help researchers better understand the reasons for their survey participation preferences, which could inform future survey design and administration strategies.</p>
              <p>*We have included this as further research in the conclusion. We did explore qualitative insights in a previous study which we have now referenced. Do Physicians Prefer to Complete Online or Mail Surveys? Findings From a National Longitudinal Survey. T. Taylor and A. Scott. Evaluation &amp; the Health Professions 2019 Vol. 42 Issue 1 Pages 41-70. DOI: 10.1177/0163278718807744</p>
              <p>11. Provide more information on the implications of their findings for healthcare and survey research communities.</p>
              <p>*We have added text (as above) to the conclusion.</p>
              <p>12. Address the study's limitations in more detail and discuss potential ways to overcome them in future research.</p>
              <p>* We have included this in the discussion in response to all of the previous comments.</p>
              <p>13. Elaborate on the practical implications of their findings, such as cost savings, logistical benefits, and challenges or barriers to implementing email reminders.</p>
              <p>*This suggestion is potentially useful but is not directly related to the aims of our research.</p>
              <p>14. Clearly outline the next steps needed for future research to build upon the current study and address its limitations.</p>
              <p>We have done this on the basis of previous suggestions by this referee – in the discussion and conclusion.</p>
              <p>Writing Quality, Understanding Easiness, Clarity, and Organization:</p>
              <p>- Overall, the writing quality of the paper seems to be good, with clear descriptions of the methods, results, and conclusions. The organization appears logical, with sections following a conventional structure for a research article.</p>
              <p>- Suggestions for improvement:</p>
              <p>a) Some portions of the text, particularly in the Methods section, could be further clarified for better readability. Consider rephrasing complex sentences and providing more straightforward explanations of the study design and data analysis.</p>
              <p>*We have edited the methods section to clarify things where possible, though with no specific guidance from the reviewer we hope we have addressed this concern.</p>
              <p>b) In the Introduction and Discussion sections, the authors could provide more context on the importance of their research question and the implications of their findings for the broader healthcare and survey research communities.</p>
              <p>*We have added text in the discussion and conclusions</p>
              <p>Content Accuracy, Comprehensiveness, Clinical Usefulness, and Significance:</p>
              <p>- The content appears accurate, and the methodology is comprehensive. However, some concerns have been raised regarding the study's limitations, which could impact the clinical usefulness and significance of the findings.</p>
              <p>- Suggestions for improvement:</p>
              <p>a) Address the weaknesses mentioned in previous comments, such as the limited generalizability of the study, potential non-response bias, and factors influencing email effectiveness.</p>
              <p>*Done – see above responses</p>
              <p>b) Explore additional intervention approaches, such as varying incentives for participation, using different communication channels, or incorporating personalized messaging to identify the most effective strategies for increasing response rates.</p>
              <p>*Mentioned as further research in the conclusion</p>
              <p>c) Consider conducting a qualitative investigation to understand the reasons behind physicians' survey participation preferences, which could inform future survey design and administration strategies.</p>
              <p>Mentioned as further research in the conclusion</p>
              <p>d) Provide a more in-depth literature review to better contextualize the study within the broader research landscape and identify gaps in current knowledge.</p>
              <p>*We are limited on space and have kept the literature review focussed and specific to the research questions we are addressing.</p>
              <p>e) Discuss the practical implications of the study findings, including potential cost savings or logistical benefits of using email reminders, as well as any challenges or barriers to implementation.</p>
              <p>*This is discussed in the conclusion.</p>
              <p>f) Include a more detailed description of the target population and the representativeness of the sample to help readers understand the context and relevance of the study findings</p>
              <p>*We have included a new Table 1 comparing the respondents in trial to the population of GPs and specialists in 2018. We have included a few sentences in the text on p8 to describe this table.</p>
              <p>g) Present a clear plan for future research, outlining the next steps needed to build upon the current study and address its limitations.</p>
              <p>*Mentioned as further research in the conclusion.</p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>
