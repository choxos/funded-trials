                  <p id="Par1">At a population level, small reductions in energy intake have the potential to contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of childhood obesity. In many school systems, there is the potential to achieve a reduction in energy intake through modest improvements in foods packed in children’s school lunchboxes. This study will assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention that uses an existing school-based communication application to reduce the kilojoule content from discretionary foods and drinks consumed by children from school lunchboxes whilst at school.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">A Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in up to 36 primary schools in the Hunter New England, Central Coast and Mid North Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia. Designed using the Behaviour Change Wheel, schools will be randomly allocated to receive either a 5-month (1.5 school terms) multi-component intervention that includes: 1) school lunchbox nutrition guidelines; 2) curriculum lessons; 3) information pushed to parents via an existing school-based communication application and 4) additional parent resources to address common barriers to packing healthy lunchboxes or a control arm (standard school practices). The study will assess both child level dietary outcomes and school-level implementation outcomes. The primary trial outcome, mean energy (kJ) content of discretionary lunchbox foods <italic>packed in children’s lunchboxes</italic>, will be assessed at baseline and immediately post intervention (5 months or 1.5 school terms). Analyses will be performed using intention to treat principles, assessing differences between groups via hierarchical linear regression models.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study will be the first fully powered randomised controlled trial internationally to examine the impact of an m-health intervention to reduce the mean energy from discretionary food and drinks packed in the school lunchbox. The intervention has been designed with scalability in mind and will address an important evidence gap which, if shown to be effective, has the potential to be applied at a population level.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par16">Excessive weight gain is a leading contributor to the disease burden in Australia and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As such, addressing overweight and obesity and the promotion of healthy eating habits in children and adults is a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is evidence that high intake of energy-dense, nutrient poor foods, referred to as ‘discretionary foods’, is a risk factor for obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As consumption patterns of these foods in childhood predicts intake in adulthood, establishing healthy dietary patterns in children may help to reduce the future burden of nutrition related chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Accordingly, leading health authorities and governments internationally support schools to implement healthy nutrition policies and practices to limit the provision and consumption of discretionary foods among school-aged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Whilst there have been considerable efforts internationally to improve the availability and purchase of healthy foods provided or sold at school via cafeterias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and canteens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], most of the food consumed (86%) at school by students in many countries is brought from home via a lunchbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, often the foods packed within lunchboxes are high in energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. School lunchboxes in Australia, for example, contain an average of approximately 3000 kilojoules (kJ) and more than 3 serves (1200 kJ) of discretionary foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly, lunchboxes in the UK and USA also contain excessive discretionary foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with a study conducted in the UK reporting that the majority of lunchboxes (82%) had discretionary choices such as savoury snacks and confectionary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A study in the USA with 129 Year 5 and 6 students reported children with packed lunches consumed significantly more sugar, saturated fat, sodium and overall energy than those consuming school provided meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. At a population level, small reductions in energy intake, equivalent to approximately 420 kJ across a whole day, have the potential to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Given the excessive energy content and frequent inclusion of discretionary food items in children lunchboxes, modest reductions in the packing of these items in lunchboxes is likely to make an important contribution to achieving such a reduction in energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Whilst evidence and Government policy support improving the nutritional quality of foods packed for children, there is currently little evidence regarding interventions targeting improvement in the nutritional quality of school lunchboxes. A systematic review, conducted by the research team, of interventions targeting the nutritional quality of school and centre-based care lunchboxes identified only ten trials including eight randomised controlled trials and two with quasi-experimental designs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] all of which tested approaches to supporting parents to pack healthy foods. All studies included a parental knowledge component via pamphlets, posters, workshops and newsletters, with the majority also including a child knowledge strategy via videos, games and curriculum. Interventions also included physical resources such as lunch packs and containers (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and incentives for children to try fruits and vegetables (<italic>n</italic> = 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The interventions reported considerable challenges in accessing and engaging parents through these means. The review found inconsistent impacts between lunchbox interventions in relation to the packing of discretionary foods and beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A meta-analysis on four of the included studies highlighted a moderate increase in the provision of vegetables, but no change to fruit. However, there were limitations of included studies in the review as consumption across the entire day was not recorded for the majority of studies which make it difficult to determine any displacement of food serves outside of school hours. As such, previous studies have typically reported little impact of lunchbox interventions on child dietary intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">Evidence is emerging regarding the effectiveness of mobile text messaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and app based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] as a highly scalable, effective and cost-effective intervention approach for improving a variety of health behaviours. To examine proof of concept and feasibility of such an intervention in improving the packing of healthy lunchboxes, a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) was undertaken in 12 primary schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The ‘SWAP IT’ pilot intervention used an existing school mobile communication app, already adopted by schools to communicate with parents, to provide information via push-notifications and messages to encourage parents to ‘swap’ discretionary foods from their child’s lunchboxes to healthier alternatives consistent with the Australian Dietary Guidelines (‘everyday’ foods). The pilot found 68% of 2100 parents opened the messages via the school mobile communication app, and 84% reported the messages provided were useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Observational measurement of children’s lunchboxes (<italic>n</italic> = 1462) following the pilot intervention found an increase in the mean energy from everyday foods packed in the lunchbox (83.13 kJ, CI = 2.65, 163.61, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04), and a reduction in both the mean energy from discretionary foods (− 211.61 kJ, CI = -426.16, 2.95, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) and mean total energy of foods packed in lunchboxes (− 131.61 kJ, CI = -317.26, 54.05, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16) among students attending intervention schools compared with control schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The results demonstrated that the intervention approach is highly feasible, acceptable and holds significant promise for reducing the mean energy of foods packed in school lunch boxes.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to assess, via a Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intervention that makes use of an existing school mobile communication app (SkoolBag) to decrease the energy (kJ) content from discretionary foods and drinks packed in school lunchboxes. The intervention will also assess a range of implementation outcomes including school and parent level adoption, acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness in order to inform strategies for large scale dissemination.</p>

                <p id="Par36">The intervention was developed using the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The BCW consolidates 19 frameworks of behaviour change and provides a process to move from behavioural diagnosis to intervention design. The BCW recommends thorough formative evaluation to identify impediments to behaviour change and to select appropriate behaviour change techniques to address these. Accordingly, extensive formative research was conducted to identify barriers and potential behaviour change techniques that may support parents to pack healthy school lunchboxes. Specifically, the team undertook a review of published literature of existing lunchbox interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], conducted focus groups with parents to identify local contextual barriers, and undertook telephone interviews with parents (<italic>n</italic> = 228) (Janssen, Sutherland, Nathan, Wyse, Lecathelinais, Finch, Wolfenden: Parent acceptability of using a mobile phone application to promote healthy lunchboxes for childcare- and school-aged children, unpublished) and principals (<italic>n</italic> = 196) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to assess barriers, and the acceptability of potential intervention strategies, content and delivery modalities.

                <p id="Par47">Mean energy (kJ) content of discretionary foods packed from the school lunchboxes will be assessed using a valid and reliable lunchbox observational audit, known as the School Food Checklist (SFC), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] an approach successfully applied in the pilot and deemed highly feasible in assessing foods packed in the lunchbox resulting in 98% of lunchbox photographs being included in the analysis and will be extended to also assess consumption by taking a second photo at the end of the final school break period. On a randomly selected school day, prior to recess, lunch and in-class vegetable and fruit breaks (pre meal assessment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], students will be asked to display their lunchbox on their desk and remove all lids from storage containers. To prevent response bias, parents or students will not be aware of the day of data collection. Trained research assistants will take a photograph of each student’s lunchbox at the beginning of the school day prior to any contents being consumed (“foods packed”) and will also write down any ambiguous items to aid analysis. Students will also be asked if they intend to purchase from the canteen that day.</p>
                <p id="Par48">Students will be asked to place unconsumed or partially consumed items back into their lunchbox, after each meal break (in-class vegetable and fruit breaks, recess and lunch). A second photograph will be taken following the final meal break (post meal assessment). Measures of energy consumption will be calculated by subtracting the energy content of foods and drinks remaining in student’s lunchbox at the post-meal assessment from the energy content of foods and drinks in the lunchbox during pre-meal assessment (“foods consumed”).</p>
                <p id="Par49">The SFC is a previously validated tool shown to be accurate and reliable in measuring energy from food and drinks for the Australian context. The SFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] enables assessment of the kJ content and serving size for each lunchbox item. The checklist includes 20 food and drinks categories including main food items such as bread, fast food and leftovers/mixed dishes and snack items such as noodles, packaged snacks, biscuits and crackers, chocolate and lollies, cheese, eggs, dried fruit and nuts, muesli and fruit bars, cakes and buns, muffins and scones, pastries, desserts, yoghurt, fruit, vegetables, milk, soft drink, water and fruit juice. Foods in each category were included based on the frequency of consumption at school for children aged five to 15 years, according to the National Nutrition Survey 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the average kJ per category identified. The SFC will be used to identify the total lunchbox contents and food items in the lunchbox including the kJ content, number of ‘everyday’ or discretionary lunchbox items and the mean cost of lunchbox items. Everyday items refer to food and drink items that are part of the core food groups as determined by the Australian Dietary Guidelines and Australian Guide to Healthy Eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Food items classified as discretionary choices are items considered to be energy dense with minimal nutritional value such as cakes, chocolate, lollies, crisps, muesli bars and fast food.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Minor modifications were made to the SFC to separately categorise ‘everyday’ and discretionary food choices and updated to reflect the mean cost of lunchbox items at the time the pilot study was conducted (2017). Categories that required adjustment included: biscuit and crackers, cakes and buns, muffins and scones, desserts and packaged snacks. All foods in these categories were individually divided and categorised as an ‘everyday’ or discretionary food by consensus among dietitians. The serve size and kJ per serve information was obtained from FoodWorks Professional Edition V7 (version 7; Xyris Software, Highgate Hill, QLD, Australia), or if unavailable from FoodWorks, via a snack food database created for pre-packaged items. The snack food database was created by dietitians based on a significant array of pre-packaged snacks available in Australian supermarkets and included detailed nutrition information for each food item.</p>
                <p id="Par51">Trained dietitians will observe each school lunchbox photo and classify each food and drink item according to its SFC category and the serving size. To further aid this process, decision rules developed will be used to ensure standardisation of assessments.

                <p id="Par66">Based on our pilot results, a standard lunchbox contains 1089 kJ (SD = 900 kJ) from discretionary foods. With an ICC of 0.05, 36 schools with 140 students per school will enable detection of a 200 kJ difference between groups at follow-up on the primary trial outcome, with 80% power at the 0.05 significance level. As approximately 420 kJ across a whole day has potential to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and a child consumes a third of their daily energy requirements whilst at school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], this magnitude of effect is considered meaningful at a population level.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p id="Par67">All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (version 9.3) statistical software. Using intention to treat principles, differences between groups in both costs and outcomes will be assessed using hierarchical linear (or logistic for binary outcomes) regression models, adjusting for pre-specified prognostic variables and random effects for repeated measures on students. Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation methods. All statistical tests will be two tailed with an alpha of 0.05. Students intending to purchase their lunch from the canteen will be removed from the primary analysis to focus on students whose lunchbox is their sole source of energy for the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par69">There is currently scarce evidence available regarding the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions to support parents and primary schools in improving the nutritional quality of the foods packed in school lunchboxes. Internationally, there have been few RCTs with only five interventions published that have aimed to improve the nutritional quality of school lunchboxes and those conducted have largely failed to reach parents, were resource intensive and logistically challenging to deliver at scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The SWAP IT trial will be the first m-health based trial to assess the effectiveness of a lunchbox intervention targeting primary schools, children and their parents. A pilot of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] indicated it to be highly feasible, acceptable to both parents and schools, and showed promising signs in reducing mean energy content of packed foods at a population level.</p>
              <p id="Par70">With scalability at the forefront of the intervention design, SWAP IT has been designed in collaboration with all key stakeholders and in partnership with key industry organisations in order to meet a policy objective to impact on childhood overweight and obesity at a population level. Using technology as the primary mode of delivery into the home environment, the intervention has been designed to overcome the barriers identified in the literature in improving the nutritional quality of lunchboxes and provides a means for reaching large number of parents. However, as the intervention is embedded within existing school communication systems and processes with which both schools and parents are actively engaged, findings of the pilot found that exposure to the intervention continues across the delivery period. Embedding behaviour change interventions within existing technological infrastructure provides a unique platform to scale-up the SWAP IT intervention, if shown to be effective.</p>
