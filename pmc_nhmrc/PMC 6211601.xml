                  <p id="Par1">With persisting maternal and infant health disparities, new models of maternity care are needed to meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. To date, there is limited evidence of successful and sustainable programs. Birthing on Country is a term used to describe an emerging evidence-based and community-led model of maternity care for Indigenous families; its impact requires evaluation.</p>

              <p id="Par12">Maternal and infant health disparities have persisted between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous Australians, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women having disproportionately higher rates of: maternal mortality (~ 3 times higher) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; preterm births (14% vs. 8%); low birth weight infants (liveborn: 12% vs. 6%); and perinatal deaths (12 vs. 9/1000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal mortality, serious neonatal morbidity, and moderate to severe childhood disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It contributes to more than two-thirds of perinatal mortality (fetal loss and neonatal death) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and is associated with diabetes, cardiovascular and renal disease in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Queensland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and Western Australian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] research suggests the majority of perinatal deaths are associated with preterm birth and low birth weight, which in turn are linked to modifiable risk factors: maternal psychosocial stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], infections in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], smoking in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], limited maternal education and young maternal age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. An Australian Indigenous study found preterm births and perinatal deaths decrease as the number of antenatal consultations increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Targeting the antenatal period with interventions that are culturally safe and high quality are essential to addressing these health disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Birthing on Country</title>
                <p id="Par13">The Australian National Maternity Services Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] identified three priority areas for improving services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women: 1) developing and expanding culturally competent maternity care; 2) developing and supporting an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander maternity workforce; and 3) developing dedicated programs for ‘Birthing on Country’ (best practice maternal and infant services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women).</p>
                <p id="Par14">An international literature review on Birthing on Country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] was commissioned by the Australian government who defined Birthing on Country as:<disp-quote><p id="Par15">‘<italic>Maternity services designed and delivered for Indigenous women that encompass some or all of the following elements: are community based and governed; allow for incorporation of traditional practice; involve a connection with land and country; incorporate a holistic definition of health; value Indigenous and non-Indigenous ways of knowing and learning; risk assessment and service delivery; are culturally competent; and developed by, or with, Indigenous people</italic>’ (p. 5).</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par16">The review assisted in identifying the characteristics of successful services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and at a national Birthing on Country workshop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] participants described Birthing on Country as:<disp-quote><p id="Par17"><italic>‘a metaphor for the best start in life for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies and their families, an appropriate transition to motherhood and parenting for women, and an integrated, holistic and culturally appropriate model of care for all’</italic> (p. 25).</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par18">Aboriginal participants described Birthing on Country as <italic>‘the most powerful thing’</italic> stating it was ‘<italic>about cultural choice’</italic> and ‘<italic>being able to have babies safely on country’</italic> (p. 33):<disp-quote><p id="Par19"><italic>‘not only bio-physical outcomes ... it’s much, much broader than just the labour and delivery ...

                <title>Caseload midwifery models</title>
                <p id="Par21">Continuity of care and carer has been identified as an important characteristic of culturally safe care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Caseload midwifery (or midwifery group practice, MGP) is one such model that delivers continuity of midwifery carer throughout pregnancy, labour, birth and the early postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. MGP has been found to significantly improve outcomes for women and babies including reductions in preterm birth and increased satisfaction, breastfeeding, and cost savings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Only 10% of Australian women currently have access to caseload midwifery models, with only a disproportionately small number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women receiving this model of service delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Few services exclusively target Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanderwomen and many women do not receive continuity of care across the maternity episode; therefore, there is a paucity of research in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                <title>The research gap</title>
                <p id="Par22">The main methodological limitations of published interventional studies aimed at improving care and services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers and babies are small sample sizes, short-term evaluations and a lack of an appropriate comparison group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although several studies show promising results, most lack appropriate methodology and/or statistical power. Birthing on Country is a complex intervention that has not yet been rigorously evaluated in an urban Australian setting. The current study will contribute to addressing this knowledge gap by employing a methodologically rigorous study design and participatory research methods to evaluate an urban Birthing on Country continuity of care model for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families in Australia.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par31">South East Queensland comprises one of the largest and fastest growing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations of Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The Birthing in Our Community service, launched in 2013, is a new model of care informed by the Birthing on Country literature and Guiding Principles. This model of care is available to women having Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies at the Mater Mothers’ Hospital (MMH), one of the largest tertiary maternity hospitals in Australia. Birthing in Our Community is conducted in partnership with two local Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations: the Institute for Urban Indigenous Health (IUIH) and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Health Service Brisbane Limited (ATSICHS). The partnership is underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding and Statement of Commitment to share resources to redesign maternal and infant health services. Service characteristics were based on the literature review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the workshop report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] as well as tailoring to the local context following recommendations from a World Café attended by 60 local stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; which resulted in the partnership. The overarching aim of the Birthing in Our Community partnership is to close the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander maternal and infant health outcomes, particularly preterm birth, through the translation of evidence-based strategies into the Birthing in Our Community program.</p>
                <p id="Par32">In developing the evaluation of the Birthing in Our Community program we aimed to compare outcomes for mothers and infants with a similar cohort of women receiving standard care. After reviewing the statistics from across South East Queensland, the most appropriate comparison cohort was women attending the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (RBWH) where senior managers and researchers agreed to collaborate on a joint project and funding submission. However, as the funding was being awarded, the RBWH also changed their model of care (2013) for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women through the Ngarrama Indigenous Maternity Service and it is no longer standard care. The Ngarrama Service is a government-funded midwifery continuity of care service for women having an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander baby/ies and planning to birth at the RBWH (located fewer than six kilometres north of the MMH). Thus we have agreed to evaluate both new services, Birthing in Our Community and the Ngarrama Service, and will compare them to each other, and to women receiving standard care and to baseline data from both hospitals. (Note: not all women having Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies at both MMH and RBWH access the Indigenous-specific models of care hence the concurrent comparison with standard care). Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> outlines the components of the different models of care available to women having Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies at the MMH and RBWH. For the first time, researchers will test the effectiveness of caseload midwifery in an urban setting where 100% of the midwives’ caseload are women having Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies receiving care across the maternity continuum (antenatal, birth, until 6 weeks postnatal).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Models of care available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families at study sites</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Birthing in Our Community (Group 1)</th><th>Standard Care (Groups 2, 5)</th><th>Ngarrama Maternity Service (Group 4)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Indigenous governance (operating through a Steering Committee) functioning in accordance with Terms of Reference and underpinned by a MOU<break/>A community-based Midwifery Group Practice (MGP), which provides continuity of care to enrolled women throughout pregnancy, birth and up to six weeks postnatally<break/>Care is provided according to hospital guidelines and protocols in the home and at community venues where regular cultural and education days are held<break/>24/7 access to caseload midwife who works in MGP of 4FTE on annualised salary with each woman allocated a primary midwife.

                <p id="Par37">Birthing in Our Community is a complex intervention with multifaceted components; identifying its ‘active ingredients’ is vital to evaluating effectiveness and replicating the intervention in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As with the Ngarrama Service, an appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] is needed that enables all stakeholders to understand not only what components are integral to success or failure but why these components are so important and influential. A Program Logic Model will be used for the monitoring and process evaluation to assess if the services are being implemented as planned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Program logic is essentially a conceptual ‘road map’ that presents the thinking/theory behind the expected outcomes of research activities.</p>
                <p id="Par38">A mixed-methods research design has therefore been selected as the most appropriate to achieve these goals, with equal weight given to both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Incorporating participatory action research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (PAR), as recommended for Indigenous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], will allow the research team to be responsive to evaluation findings throughout the duration of the study. In line with a PAR approach, the IBUS research team will meet regularly to discuss relevant issues and collaboratively plan research-related activities, with regular reflections on previous steps, progress to date, and future expectations/aspirations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Regular Steering Committee meetings provide a mechanism (Birthing in Our Community only) enabling timely feedback and regular reporting to key stakeholders.</p>

                  <title>Quantitative</title>
                  <p id="Par101">Clinical data will initially be collected in a re­identifiable form (via the unique patient identifier) so that it can be linked with data obtained from other sources (e.g. surveys), to enable the economic analyses to be undertaken. Once merged, identifiers will be removed and only the coded number will remain.</p>
                  <p id="Par102">Quantitative analyses will compare the difference in clinical outcomes between Birthing in Our Community (intervention), the Ngarrama Service (concurrent control), standard care (historical and concurrent control), and also non-Indigenous women and babies (historical and concurrent control) at MMH and RBWH.</p>
                  <p id="Par103">Data on all women attending either hospital during the study period will be extracted. Women transferring in from other hospital or rural and remote areas for higher-level services (variable available), and those with no antenatal care will be excluded from analysis. Analyses will be by birth model of care and women with multiple births and their infants with identified fetal anomaly will be excluded from analysis unless noted otherwise.</p>
                  <p id="Par104">Initial bivariate analysis will investigate possible differences between the cohorts for baseline socio-demographic (socio-economic status), and clinical characteristics (e.g. age, parity, body mass index, smoking, obstetric history) that could affect outcome measures. Dependent on data type, analysis will be undertaken using an independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test or chi-squared test. Outcome measures will be presented using relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. Multivariate logistic, linear regression models and propensity score matching will be used to adjust for confounders. Longitudinal outcomes (e.g. breastfeeding) will be analysed with generalized estimating equations to account for the correlation between observations repeated in the same person. To understand the mechanism or process that underlies the effect of model of care on outcomes, mediation analysis will be conducted to identify if and to what extent the other variables explains the relationship. All withdrawals, losses to follow-up, and deaths will be reported. Analysis will be performed with SPSS Version 22.0/Stata 14.0 and statistical significance will be at the 0.05 level.</p>
                  <p id="Par105">Survey data will be uploaded from iPads/tablet computers, Qualtrics or other software tools such as Remark (for the printed versions) to a dedicated spreadsheet and subjected to simple descriptive analysis using SPSS/Stata. Bayley-III data at the six-month infant assessment will be scored by the research assistant in real time (i.e. as the assessment proceeds) using the age-standardized Bayley Record and Score Forms, and associated Tables to give norm-referenced scores. These scores will then be uploaded onto the project specific database. Staff surveys will be analysed using SPSS/Stata to test for significant trends and potential differences between groups.</p>

                  <p id="Par106">The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to examine the direct costs, from a societal perspective, to women and their families, maternity and child health care services and other community services in relation to pregnancy and birth. We will compare the mean costs per mother/infant pair between Birthing in Our Community (Group 1) and the Ngarrama Service (Group 4) to standard care group (Group 2 and 5) up to 6 weeks postpartum. Costs will be calculated for both mother and baby to include: women and family’s out-of-pocket expenses related to clinic appointments, outpatients (ultrasound, pathology, etc.) and prescribed medicines, and hospitalisation costs. Data will be collected through routinely collected information as well as questions embedded in the 36-week antenatal and 2 month postnatal surveys. Average costs for each mother and infant for the duration of the maternity episode (i.e. from when she first confirmed her pregnancy to 6 weeks postnatal) will be calculated and compared to determine the cost effectiveness of a model of care.</p>

Data will be analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), a qualitative method of analysis which draws knowledge from everyday experiences and is descriptive. Transcripts will be read by a minimum of two team members who will identify key themes and independently create a coding system. Codes will be compared, inconsistencies discussed and reconciled, and a final coding scheme agreed before entry into NVivo Version 8. The analysis will comprise of: Firstly, coding of initial interview transcripts to identify themes and develop a coding framework. Secondly, identification and categorisation of women and staff experiences using the coding framework. The coding framework will be revised and refined as new themes emerge. Finally, key findings will be used to inform the development future Birthing on Country services. Data will be saved on the computer hard drive and transcribed verbatim.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par108">This study will test the impact of two maternity models of care for one of Australia’s highest priority health populations: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers and babies. The model and economic impact assessment have been derived from international best-practice and service evaluations in Australia and our study has the statistical power to detect a difference in preterm birth. The multi-agency approach to implementing a Birthing on Country Service Model at one site has been recommended in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy documents and will be evaluated. The economic impact assessment aims to quantify the impact of the model by articulating the process by which research leads to impacts on the end-user and/or the broader community. If the model is successful and demonstrates a good return on investment, we will have developed and evaluated a culturally safe service model transferable to other settings for trialling in a broader context.</p>
