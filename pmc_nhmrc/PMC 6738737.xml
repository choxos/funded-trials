                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Children with bilateral cerebral palsy often experience difficulties with posture, gross motor function and manual ability, impacting independence in daily life activities, participation and quality of life (QOL). Hand–Arm Bimanual Intensive Training Including Lower Extremity (HABIT-ILE) is a novel intensive motor intervention integrating upper and lower extremity training. This study aimed to compare HABIT-ILE to usual care in a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) in terms of gross motor function, manual ability, goal attainment, walking endurance, mobility, self-care and QOL. A within-trial cost–utility analysis will be conducted to synthesise costs and benefits of HABIT-ILE compared with usual care.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>126 children with bilateral cerebral palsy aged 6–16 years will be recruited across three sites in Australia. Children will be stratified by site and Gross Motor Function Classification System and randomised using concealed allocation to either receiving HABIT-ILE immediately or being waitlisted for 26 weeks. HABIT-ILE will be delivered in groups of 8–12 children, for 6.5 hours per day for 10 days (total 65 hours, 2 weeks). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately following intervention, and then retention of effects will be tested at 26 weeks. Primary outcomes will be the Gross Motor Function Measure and ABILHAND-Kids. Secondary outcomes will be brain structural integrity, walking endurance, bimanual hand performance, self-care, mobility, performance and satisfaction with individualised goals, and QOL. Analyses will follow standard principles for RCTs using two-group comparisons on all participants on an intention-to-treat basis. Comparisons between groups for primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted using regression models.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability in childhood<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with an estimated prevalence of 1.4 in 1000 live births.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Six hundred children are newly diagnosed with CP each year, with greater than 35 000 people living with CP in Australia.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Over 61% of children with CP have ‘bilateral’ motor involvement, impairing movement on both sides of the body.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For some of these children, all four limbs and trunk are affected, making both walking and effective upper limb use challenging. These limitations significantly impact their independence and participation in home, school, work and community life.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> People with CP have poorer health outcomes compared with age-matched peers.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Increased severity of physical disability is associated with reduced general health, greater pain and discomfort,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> reduced independence in daily life skills<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and poorer vocational outcomes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Interventions that reduce the impact of the physical disability and promote independence in daily life skills, inclusion and community participation are essential.</p>
              <p>Traditional neurodevelopmental interventions were frequently based on passive movement experiences using passively guided movements (with the aim of normalising movement), as well as passive manual stretching (aimed to improve or maintain range of motion and to decrease contractures and spasticity). These have been shown to be ineffective in improving motor outcomes for children with CP.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Contemporary and proven effective interventions for school-aged children with CP involve child-active task-specific motor training from the motor learning paradigm, such as constraint-induced movement therapy, bimanual training and goal-directed training.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Since these interventions predominantly target upper and lower extremity motor performance separately, the evidence bases are different.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> There have been fewer studies investigating task-specific interventions to target lower compared with upper limb motor performance. A recent systematic review identified the effectiveness of specific gait training in increasing gait speed for children with unilateral and bilateral CPs (effect size=0.92, p=0.01).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> To date, significant evidence exists for intensive upper extremity interventions (≈60 hours) to enhance upper limb motor performance in children with unilateral CP.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9 11</xref> have confirmed growing evidence for intensive contemporary motor learning-based approaches to upper limb training for school-aged children with unilateral CP (eg, constraint-induced movement therapy, Hand–Arm Bimanual Intensive Training) to improve upper limb motor performance.</p>
              <p>Since children with bilateral CP often have both upper and lower limbs involved, Hand–Arm Bimanual Intensive Training Including Lower Extremity (HABIT-ILE) was invented to treat both the upper and lower limbs concurrently. In children with unilateral CP, a randomised control trial (RCT) demonstrated the efficacy of HABIT-ILE for both the upper and lower extremities.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Results obtained from concurrent upper and lower extremity training were similar to those obtained by children who underwent upper extremity training alone.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These findings led researchers to test whether HABIT-ILE intervention might be helpful for children with bilateral CP.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A recent systematic review of interventions to improve upper limb function in children with bilateral CP, however, has found a large variety of different interventions addressing upper limb function, but most studies have weak to moderate methodological quality.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The strongest evidence was from a small quasi-RCT of HABIT-ILE, and the authors highlighted the need for further high-quality trials.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Compared with a waitlist control group, children with bilateral CP who underwent 84 hours of HABIT-ILE achieved significantly greater gains in manual ability (ABILHAND-Kids n<sup>2</sup>=0.32, p&lt;0.001), self-care on the Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (n<sup>2</sup>=0.26, p=0.001), gross motor function on the Gross Motor Function Measure 66-item (GMFM-66: n<sup>2</sup>=0.33, p&lt;0.001), walking distance on the 6 min Walk Test (6MWT: n<sup>2</sup>=0.17, p&lt;0.03) and balance on the Paediatric Balance Scale (n<sup>2</sup>=0.28, p&lt;0.002). These promising results indicate that a larger RCT is warranted to confirm the efficacy of HABIT-ILE on manual ability and gross motor function for children with bilateral CP. This multisite RCT, HABIT-ILE Australia, will compare this intensive motor training approach to usual care in school-aged children with bilateral CP at a lower dose than the original study (65 hours vs 90 hours). This lower dose was selected based on potential acceptability and feasibility within the Australian context.</p>

                <p>This multisite RCT will be conducted in three Australian states (Queensland (QLD), New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia (WA)) with 126 school-aged children with bilateral CP. This RCT with a pragmatic, single-blind design will determine if HABIT-ILE is more effective than usual care to improve manual ability (ABILHAND-Kids) and gross motor function (GMFM-66) immediately postintervention and retention at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes will test the differential effects of HABIT-ILE compared with usual care on neuroplastic changes in brain structural integrity, functional and structural connectivity, walking endurance (6MWT), self-care and mobility (Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory–Computerised Assessment Test (PEDI-CAT)), bimanual performance (Both Hands Assessment: BoHA), performance of and satisfaction with individualised occupational performance goals (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)), and quality of life (QOL) (Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life (CP QOL) Questionnaire: CP QOL-Child or CP QOL-Teen) immediately postintervention and retention at 26 weeks after the intervention.</p>

                <p>One hundred twenty-six school-aged children between 6 and 16 years of age at study entry with bilateral CP will be recruited. Families with a child meeting eligibility criteria will be invited to join the study through our three collaborating sites and associated clinical services (Queensland Children’s Hospital, Cerebral Palsy Alliance and Perth Children’s Hospital). Recruitment from three major metropolitan centres will enable the target sample size to be achieved (50 in NSW, 50 in QLD and 26 in WA).</p>
                <p>Recruitment at each site will begin following ethical and governance approvals. Recruitment will draw on current databases within each organisation, referrals from clinical services. Based on population numbers available on the Australian Cerebral Palsy Register (1240 potentially eligible participants) and well-established state-wide clinical networks, recruitment of 126 participants is feasible across the three sites. It is expected that final data collection will occur in July 2021.</p>

                <p>1. HABIT-ILE is a motor learning approach simultaneously addressing coordination of the upper and lower limbs.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Key elements of HABIT-ILE:</p>
                <p><italic>Dose:</italic> The total dose is 65 hours of HABIT-ILE. The 65 hours will be achieved through a 2-week intensive group-delivered day camp for 6.5 hours/day over 10 days conducted during the school holidays. Results from our previous research in intensive upper limb training in unilateral CP<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–27</xref> and from our systematic review of all upper limb interventions<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> indicate that 60 hours is likely to be a sufficient dose to achieve significant changes in motor performance, and the 2-week camps are feasible for children and their families. The model of HABIT-ILE to be tested has been adapted to maximise future clinical translation to ensure acceptability and feasibility to children with bilateral CP and their families in Australia.</p>
                <p><italic>Mode:</italic> Groups of 8–12 children (1:1 or 2:1 therapist/volunteer/student to child ratio according to ability).</p>
                <p><italic>Content and tailoring:</italic> Intervention will be based on the child’s motor abilities (determined at baseline), age, interests and self-identified functional goals. Tasks/activities are made incrementally more challenging. Practice is structured, using part-task and whole-task practice with high repetition and ongoing feedback about performance.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 28</xref> A process of shaping with progressive approximations is undertaken over 10 days. For example, if a pincer grasp is required for the goal (eg, do buttons up on school shirt) and the child is not yet performing this grasp effectively, children will practice tasks that progress incrementally towards this grasp. This requires a clinical reasoning process whereby components/impairments leading to the breakdown of goal performance are identified (eg, strength, active range of motion, coordination, and motor planning or strategy) then targeted with deliberately selected, incrementally challenging games and activities.</p>
                <p><italic>Upper extremity:</italic> Tasks that will be performed include (1) incremented table top fine motor activities, (2) activities of daily living when sitting/standing/walking, and (3) gross motor play and physical activities.</p>
                <p><italic>Lower extremity and postural control:</italic> Based on the child’s baseline motor abilities, postural control/sitting balance will be targeted by sitting on a bench (without postural supports), sitting on an inflated fitness ball, standing with/without upper limb support and/or standing on a balance board. Postural control will be incrementally challenged by increase of duration of sitting or standing, by increasing of inflation of the fitness balls, progression from one mode to a more difficult one (eg, standing on a flat hard surface to standing on a balance board) and/or introduction of physical and task demands. Children will also engage in gross motor part and whole practice relevant to their functional goals. These may include transfers (sit to stand or floor to stand), stair climbing, walking, running and/or other physical activities.</p>
                <p><italic>Intervention providers:</italic> A minimum of one physiotherapist and one occupational therapist delivering HABIT-ILE at each site will complete standardised training provided by the developer of HABIT-ILE (YB). This will coincide with the first intensive intervention camp conducted in Brisbane, Australia. The trained therapists will, in turn, train and supervise therapy students, volunteers and therapists to deliver HABIT-ILE in the subsequent camps at their site.</p>
                <p><italic>Location:</italic> The intervention groups will be conducted in the clinics in each of the participating sites.</p>
                <p>2. Usual care: Usual care over the 6-month waitlist period will vary for children with CP across Australia and can range from weekly clinic-based therapy sessions to school-based consultative services provided on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis. In order to understand the variability in usual care received, all families in both groups will complete a health resource use questionnaire at baseline and 6 months postintervention. This will capture the duration of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and any other concurrent medical interventions, such as intramuscular botulinum toxin A injections and/or serial casting. All children in the usual care group will be offered HABIT-ILE commencing at the subsequent school holiday following 6 months’ retention time point (T3).</p>

Structural brain images will be acquired using high-resolution 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) and high-resolution 3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Diffusion MRI data will be acquired using a multishell approach with 20 directions at b=1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, 60 directions at b=3000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> and 8 non-diffusion-weighted images (b=0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>). The acquisition will be split in four blocks (of 22 directions) to allow more efficient rescanning of data affected by motion. Half of the blocks are reverse phase encoded to assist in the correction of residual distortions due to susceptibility inhomogeneities. fMRI data will be acquired using a block design, with a simple active hand and passive foot-tapping task. Two two-dimensional gradient recalled echo images (echo timeTE1/TE2, 4.92/7.38 ms) were used to acquire a field map for functional data, which assists when correcting for distortion due to susceptibility inhomogeneities.

                <p>Participants can withdraw at any time. Participants who choose to withdraw from the study will not be penalised in any way. If they wish to continue with therapy intervention for their child, they will be assisted to source another local therapy option that matches their preferences. Participants are informed of their right to withdraw at any time without consequences at the time of reading participant information forms and signing of consent forms. Participants can enrol and undergo HABIT-ILE irrespective of whether they consent to the neuroimaging and/or economic analysis aspects of the study. Participants who withdraw will not be replaced, as the a priori power calculation will account for a 10% dropout rate and 10% crossover rate.</p>

                <p>A 1.6 logit change on the ABILHAND-Kids was achieved in a small RCT of HABIT-ILE.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A sample of 126 (63 in each arm) yields 80% power, with significance at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 to show a difference of 1.6 ABILHAND-Kids logits, with an SD of change of 3 and buffering for 10% attrition. We will have &gt;90% power to detect a difference of 5 points or greater on the GMFM (assuming SD=6) and alpha=0.05, buffering for 10% attrition). For neuroimaging outcomes, a 1% change in fractional anisotropy using fMRI-guided tractography and a 6% change in cortical thickness are considered realistic estimates for current therapies. Our recent work on power analysis for imaging measures of neuroplasticity in CP suggests that, assuming an 80% success rate of MRI, 39 subjects are required to detect a 1% change in FA using fMRI-guided tractography, the most sensitive available method.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Analyses will follow standard principles for RCTs using two-group comparisons on all participants on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary comparison immediately postintervention (T2) and retention at (T3) based on ABILHAND-Kids and GMFM scores will be between treatment groups using linear regression with treatment group (HABIT-ILE/waitlist control) included as the main effect and baseline ABILHAND-Kids as the covariable. Effect estimates will be presented as mean difference and 95% CIs. Secondary analyses will use similar methods to compare outcomes between groups immediately postintervention (T2) for brain structural integrity and structural connectivity (diffusion MRI-guided and fMRI-guided tractography), and at T2 and 26 weeks (T3) for clinical outcomes: walking distance, bimanual performance, self-care, mobility, performance of and satisfaction with individualised goals, and QOL. In cases where interval data are not able to be transformed appropriately for regression analyses, non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney U) will be used for between-treatment comparisons. Sensitivity analyses of all outcomes will be conducted using multiple imputation techniques to investigate the effect of non-ignorable missing data during follow-up.</p>

              <p>Over 60% of children with CP have bilateral motor impairment impacting independence in activities of daily living, participation and QOL. To date, there is limited evidence for effective interventions to improve motor and functional outcomes in children with bilateral CP. Building on a previous small study,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the HABIT-ILE Australia project is the first large-scale study to test the efficacy of this intensive motor training intervention on motor and neuroimaging outcomes in children with bilateral CP. One potential limitation of the study is that therapy students under the supervision of trained therapists will be primarily delivering the HABIT-ILE intervention. This will be accounted for by providing 1 day of standardised training for all interventionists, daily debriefing meetings at the end of each day and ongoing daily feedback from supervising therapists. In addition, fidelity checks with the HABIT-ILE developer (YB) will occur throughout the conduct of each HABIT-ILE camp. Second, the dose being tested (65 hours) was a pragmatic choice based on what is likely to be feasible and acceptable in the Australian context. This dose, however, is less than that in previous studies (90 hours). This study will additionally determine whether HABIT-ILE is translatable and implementable to a broad Australian setting.</p>
              <p>The study has a number of strengths. The number of participants to be included has been calculated for both the primary clinical and secondary neuroimaging outcomes. Selected outcome measures have evidence for both validity and reliability in our population of interest. Development of standardised interventionist training and fidelity monitoring, in addition to a within-trial cost–utility analysis will provide vital information to inform the potential translation of this intervention. It is anticipated that results of this large RCT will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences.</p>
