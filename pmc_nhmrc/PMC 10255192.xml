                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Approximately 15%‚Äì20% of the adult population self-report symptoms of addictive eating. There are currently limited options for management. Motivational interviewing-based interventions, containing personalised coping skills training, have been found to be effective for behaviour change in addictive disorders (eg, alcohol). This project builds upon foundations of an addictive eating feasibility study previously conducted and co-design process involving consumers. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of a telehealth intervention targeting addictive eating symptoms in Australian adults compared with passive intervention and control groups.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This three-arm randomised controlled trial will recruit participants 18‚Äì85 years, endorsing ‚â•3 symptoms on the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) 2.0, with body mass index &gt;18.5‚Äâkg/m<sup>2</sup>. Addictive eating symptoms are assessed at baseline (pre-intervention), 3‚Äâmonths (post-intervention) and 6‚Äâmonths. Other outcomes include dietary intake and quality, depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life, physical activity and sleep hygiene. Using a multicomponent clinician-led approach, the active intervention consists of five telehealth sessions (15‚Äì45‚Äâmin each) delivered by a dietitian over 3‚Äâmonths. The intervention uses personalised feedback, skill-building exercises, reflective activities and goal setting. Participants are provided with a workbook and website access. The passive intervention group receives the intervention via a self-guided approach with access to the workbook and website (no telehealth). The control group receives personalised written dietary feedback at baseline and participants advised to follow their usual dietary pattern for 6‚Äâmonths. The control group will be offered the passive intervention after 6‚Äâmonths. The primary endpoint is YFAS symptom scores at 3‚Äâmonths. A cost‚Äìconsequence analysis will determine intervention costs alongside mean change outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Research in addictive eating has increased rapidly in recent years. Addictive eating, theorised as being on the severe end of a spectrum of overeating,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> is a phenotype of eating behaviour marked by the chronic excessive and dysregulated consumption of food.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Addictive eating, not categorised as a distinct disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> or the International Classification of Disease<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> systems, is most commonly assessed using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The YFAS adapts the DSM criteria for ‚Äòsubstance-related and addictive disorders‚Äô to specific foods.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Developed in 2009<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and revised in 2016 (YFAS 2.0)<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> according to the DSM-5 criteria, this psychometric tool assesses the presence of 11 symptoms of addictive eating. Symptoms include craving, loss of control, tolerance and withdrawal associated with eating behaviours, the repeated unsuccessful attempts to reduce the consumption of specific foods and maintenance of these behaviours despite adverse physical/emotional/social/interpersonal consequences.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The YFAS 2.0 provides two scoring options: a continuous symptom score, reflecting the number of endorsed addiction-like symptoms; and a dichotomous diagnosis of ‚Äòfood addiction‚Äô.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Using this self-report survey, approximately 15%‚Äì20% of the adult population endorse ‚â•three YFAS symptoms for addictive eating.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7‚Äì9</xref>
</p>
              <p>Higher prevalence rates of addictive eating have been reported in individuals with higher body mass indexes (BMIs) classified as overweight or obese compared with lower BMIs,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10</xref> although addictive eating is not exclusive to those with higher weight status.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It has been suggested that addictive eating in those with underweight may be related to dietary restriction practices (eg, consuming more than intended that breaches self-imposed dietary rules, intense craving resulting from extreme dieting practices).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Irrespective of weight status, results from recent research indicate that individuals with addictive eating have significantly lower diet quality and higher intake of highly processed foods.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 13 14</xref> Poor diet is a significant contributor to early death globally,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and addressing addictive eating may contribute to the prevention or management of adverse health outcomes.</p>
              <p>Addictive eating is a complex issue often overlapping with other health conditions and likely transdiagnostic.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> There is evidence that addictive eating commonly co-occurs with mental health comorbidities, particularly depression and anxiety, as well as overlapping with eating disorders, specifically binge eating disorder (BED).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 14</xref> Approximately 50% of individuals with BED meet criteria for ‚Äòfood addiction‚Äô according to the YFAS.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The present state of the literature demonstrates there is considerable overlap between BED and addictive eating.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Commonalities include the loss of control over consumption, continued overuse despite negative consequences and repeated failed attempts to reduce consumption.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> At this time, it is unclear if addictive eating will emerge as a severe subtype of BED or be regarded as a distinct form of an addiction disorder. This distinction will be important to allow for targeted treatment and prevention strategies in susceptible individuals.</p>
              <p>Current treatment options for addictive eating largely stem from online self-help groups such as Food Addicts Anonymous<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and Overeaters Anonymous.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Originating in the USA, they now have 10 000+ members worldwide and have been in existence for many years, demonstrating a need for services.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A 2021 systematic review<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> found there is limited evidence supporting implementation of feasible and effective dietary interventions run by clinicians, for the management of addictive eating.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Of the nine studies reviewed, five studies that included lifestyle modification,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> medication<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> or bariatric surgery<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> were found to improve symptoms of addictive eating.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Since publication of this review, a further four intervention studies (a behavioural weight loss programme,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> a brief telephone-based cognitive‚Äìbehavioural therapy intervention,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> a low-carbohydrate dietary programme<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and a probiotic supplement placebo-controlled trial<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) have been trialled with improvement in YFAS addictive eating symptomatology immediately following the intervention. To date, most studies have been limited in sample size and therefore have not been powered to detect a change in addictive eating symptoms.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Given the limited number of treatment options for addictive eating, there is a clear need for services, and development and testing of interventions. It has been suggested that interventions based on substance use addiction models may be effective at facilitating changes in eating behaviour.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</p>
              <p>Motivational interviewing (MI)-based interventions for addictive disorders, such as alcohol use, in combination with coping skills training for traits associated with risk of addictive behaviour, have found to be effective.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> The traits that have been linked to addictive eating include impulsivity, sensation seeking, and anxiety and depression proneness.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37‚Äì41</xref> Findings suggest that individuals with addictive eating may be highly aware of emotions, but lack the skills needed to cope with negative affect.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Using personalised coping skills for traits associated with personality and the risk of addictive behaviour in combination with MI, a communication approach used to identify and resolve ambivalence between desired behaviours and actual behaviours to increase motivation,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> may be affective to facilitate behaviour change in individuals with addictive eating.</p>
              <p>Telehealth has been shown to be a strategy to increase reach, with virtual sessions being comparable with face-to-face programmes, and to increase access to services without compromising effectiveness.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Telehealth will allow participants from anywhere in Australia to participate from home, and will reduce the demands on time and cost of travel.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Additionally, telehealth may overcome client-centred barriers by allowing a safe atmosphere for some participants to better engage and discuss more sensitive topics that they would not normally raise.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Although the effectiveness of telehealth has not been explicitly explored in populations with addictive eating, recent research demonstrates that telehealth can be as effective as in-person care for the management of mental health conditions,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> including substance use disorders<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and eating disorders.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
</p>
              <p>This project builds on a programme of work that included an initial feasibility study for the management of addictive eating in adults (Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12619001540101).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Results from the initial study indicated that the programme was feasible in the target population. Feedback received from programme participants and facilitators identified a need for a greater number of programme sessions and improved strategies for increasing retention. As a result, the programme was further refined with consumers using an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) framework.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> This co-design phase included consumers with lived experience, as well as health professionals from a range of disciplines, to ensure the culmination of multidisciplinary evidence-based strategies was included. This was unique as previous reports omit this co-design step or are siloed in their approach.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The co-design process used a series of interviews and workshops to gain input into the programme overview, aims, content and materials. Subsequent changes were made to the programme content and language used, and materials were created or refined to improve acceptability. The resultant behaviour change intervention, the TRACE (Targeted Research on Addictive and Compulsive Eating) Programme, is a complex intervention and previously described using the Medical Research Council TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) checklist for complex interventions<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) (see Leary <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> for the TIDieR checklist of the intervention).</p>
              <p>To the authors‚Äô knowledge, the TRACE Programme is the first MI-based telehealth intervention used in combination with personalised coping skills training for the management of addictive eating in adults. The aim of the current study is to determine the efficacy of a telehealth intervention (active intervention) to reduce symptoms of addictive eating in adults, relative to passive intervention and control (no intervention) groups. It is hypothesised that both the active and passive intervention groups will achieve a reduction in addictive eating symptoms relative to the control group. Potential moderators (eg, participant sociodemographics) and mediators (eg, physical activity, diet and sleep) of intervention efficacy will also be evaluated.</p>

                <p>Participants will be recruited using a range of strategies including media releases, advertising via local and national newspapers, and social media releases. Informed by our iKT process, a range of recruitment videos (tailored for gender) were also created in addition to written material, which will be released via Twitter and Facebook. A non-probability sampling technique (voluntary response sampling)<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> will be used, and recruitment will continue until the desired number of participants is achieved. Recruitment commenced in August 2021 and was completed in April 2022. Recruitment materials will direct individuals to the study information sheet and eligibility survey. The eligibility survey takes approximately 15 min to complete (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Online informed consent will be obtained prior to completing the eligibility survey.</p>

                  <p>The eligibility screener excludes individuals with a BMI below 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This measure was put in place to reduce the likelihood of recruiting participants with at-risk restrictive eating practices that may be influencing a relatively low weight status. The value of &lt;18.5‚Äâkg/m<sup>2</sup> was chosen as this is below the current healthy weight range in national guidelines for Australians<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Additionally, the eligibility screener includes the EDE-QS.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> This 12-item validated tool is commonly used to identify potential eating disorders. Based on the research team consensus, individuals who have compensatory behaviours such as bingeing/purging (specifically asked in question 7 on the EDE-QS), who may be at risk of an eating disorder and are medically compromised, will be deemed not eligible for the current study. Purging is related to higher levels of appearance dissatisfaction, anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-concept instability.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57 58</xref> As per the ethics protocol, participants endorsing any response to this question, indicating these compensatory behaviours, will be excluded from the study. The tools for eating disorders and psychological health<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54 59‚Äì63</xref> used in the study have been widely used in research in the areas of eating disorders, dietary interventions, substance use and mental health and are considered standard tools for their specific measures.

                <p>Prospective participants will complete the eligibility survey. This will include demographic questions (eg, sex, postcode, marital status, level of education, employment status); the YFAS 2.0<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> to confirm endorsement of ‚â•3 addictive eating symptoms; and the EDE-QS<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> to confirm the absence of purging behaviours. While not necessary to determine eligibility, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8),<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7),<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Perceived Stress Scale-4,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Patient Activation Measure 13<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> and two questions relating to previous treatments sought for addictive eating will also be completed by potential participants. These questions have been specifically added to extend our previously reported research<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> regarding the types of individuals recruited into interventions for addictive eating.</p>
                <p>Participants deemed eligible will proceed to the online consent form (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>‚Äîoverview of study schedule). Participants will be given a 2-week period to consider participation. After this time, a member of the research team will contact any individuals via email who have not completed the consent form to determine their interest in participating. Following this, no other contact will be made. Participants who provide electronic written consent will complete the baseline assessment surveys measuring dietary intake and eating habits, traits associated with personality and risk of addictive behaviour, quality of life and healthcare service utilisation (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>‚Äîschedule of measurements). The surveys take approximately 40‚Äâmin to complete. On completion of baseline surveys, participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups (group 1: active intervention; group 2: passive intervention; or group 3: control; see the Intervention section) and informed of their group allocation via email.</p>

                <p>Following randomisation (see the Randomisation and blinding section), a member of the research team will contact participants in group 1 via telephone or email to arrange an appointment time for their initial telehealth session. Groups 1 and 2 will be emailed a copy of the programme workbook (printable and fillable PDF versions); a hard copy is available for participants on request and be provided with password-protected access to the programme website at this time. Telehealth sessions 2‚Äì5, for participants allocated to the active intervention group (group 1), will be arranged during their first telehealth session.</p>
                <p>Participants from all three groups will receive results from the eligibility and/or baseline surveys by the research team via email. On survey completion, groups 1 and 2 will receive feedback on dominant trait/s that may be associated with increased risk of addictive behaviours (eg, anxiety proneness, impulsivity proneness); symptoms of addictive eating; dietary, caffeine and alcohol intake; sleep hygiene and physical activity levels. At this time point, group 3 will only receive feedback on dietary intake via email. At 6‚Äâmonths post-study commencement, group 3 will be provided with feedback on trait/s associated with personality and risk of addictive behaviour; symptoms of addictive eating; sleep hygiene and physical activity levels, along with access to the workbook and website (the passive intervention that group 2 received at baseline). To ensure consistency across participants, email templates and standardised reports will be used by the research team. Group 2 will be guided with written instructions in their workbook on how to use their survey results to allow personalised goal setting regarding their dietary intake and eating patterns.</p>
                <p>The primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at 3‚Äâmonths (primary endpoint, immediate post-active intervention period) and 6‚Äâmonths (follow-up) where participants will complete post-programme surveys (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>‚Äîschedule of measurements). Participants will be sent reminder emails to complete their surveys. They will be reminded a maximum of three times at each time point. If no contact is received after such time, no further contact will be made. Participants will be remunerated with a gift voucher to the value of $A20 at the completion of baseline, 3-month and 6-month surveys, corresponding to a maximum of $A60 per participant over the course of the study.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Following completion of baseline assessments, participants will be stratified into four groups by sex and mental health status (presence or absence, based on either depression scale PHQ-8 scores ‚â•15‚Äâor below 15, or anxiety scale GAD-7 scores ‚â•11‚Äâor below 11). Participants within each of these four groups will be randomised to one of the three study groups in equal ratios using permuted block randomisation, with block sizes of six. Randomisation will promote group balance on these variables shown to be important in past cross-sectional research (for example, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8 10 65</xref>). The randomisation sequence will be generated by an independent statistician and implemented by a designated study coordinator. The allocation list will be stored in a password-protected computer file and accessed only by the study coordinator.</p>
                <p>Due to the telehealth nature of the active intervention, blinding of participants and dietitians to intervention group allocation in this study will not be possible. However, several strategies will be employed to reduce the risk of bias. First, participants will only be provided with partial information on the study hypotheses. Second, all communication between participants and research staff during the period of intervention (ie, scheduling concerns, questions regarding the intervention) will be done directly between participants and the ‚Äòstudy coordinator‚Äô or their respective ‚Äòtelehealth clinician‚Äô. Lastly, statistical analyses will be conducted by researchers who are blind to group allocation prior to analysis.</p>

                <title>TRACE active intervention (group 1)</title>
                <p>Participants will receive five standardised one-on-one telehealth/phone sessions with an Accredited Practising Dietitian, with training in behaviour change and eating disorders, over a 3-month period (ie, weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12). Additionally, dietitians leading the intervention delivery will have extensive experience in private practice work and working with clients including those with disordered eating and those with mental health conditions. Sessions will range from 15 to 45 min. Telehealth sessions will be provided via the VSee platform (<ext-link xlink:href="www.vsee.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.vsee.com</ext-link>). The active intervention uses personalised feedback, skill-building exercises and goal setting to help individuals reduce their symptoms of addictive eating and improve their dietary intake and relationship with food (see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> for overview of intervention sessions). The intervention is personalised based on an individual‚Äôs dominant trait/s associated with personality and risk of addictive behaviour (ie, the traits: depression proneness, anxiety proneness, sensation proneness and/or impulsivity proneness; measured via the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> which the individual scores the most highly for) and addresses a range of factors that influence behaviour, both internal and external. Further, dominant trait/s associated with personality and risk of addictive behaviour are mapped to specific coping skill strategies, which are in turn incorporated into the goal-setting process. As part of session 1, the first 15 min of the consultation will be audio recorded to enable qualitative analysis of responses to two standardised questions regarding the elements of ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô and ‚Äòcompulsion‚Äô around the participant‚Äôs food intake. These two themes were previously identified, through thematic analysis of the feasibility study data,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> as having an influential relationship with addictive eating behaviours. On completion of the five telehealth sessions, participants will be invited to join a closed Facebook group from 3‚Äâmonths post-commencement of the intervention until the 6-month outcome survey measures are conducted. Joining the Facebook group is voluntary.</p>

                  <p>Participants will have access to a participant workbook and password-protected access to a study-specific website, both built for the study to support the materials discussed in the intervention sessions. To further facilitate the co-design process, the workbook and website content were piloted with end users (n=2) with lived experience of addictive eating, who participated in the iKT interviews/workshops. The end users reported the workbook and website to be highly usable in terms of the content, and the language used throughout as appropriate with only minor modifications made. Additionally, the piloting process allowed the estimated time to complete each workbook module to be calculated.</p>

The content of the five modules mirrors that of the telehealth sessions. The workbook also contains reflective activities/worksheets, discussed during the telehealth sessions, for the participants to complete. These elements were deemed important during the iKT process. The amount of time spent completing activities in the workbook each week, between telehealth sessions, will take approximately 30‚Äì60‚Äâmin. However, the time to complete each module may vary from person to person, and participants are advised to work through the workbook at a pace that is right for them.</p>

Participants can use their standard Facebook login, or alternatively, create a new login (a pseudo-account) that does not identify them if they wish to remain anonymous. Participants will be prompted with information related to the intervention for the 3-month duration in the form of short posts, blogs and polls. The Facebook group will allow participants to engage with other participants from the programme, as well as serve as a communication method to remind participants about assessments for the study.</p>
                  <p>The Facebook forum has the following restrictions: (1) membership will be by invitation only; (2) the group will not appear in search results or the participant‚Äôs Facebook profile; and (3) only group members will be able to see the group information and group posts. Participants will be advised of the appropriate use of language and etiquette for using the social media/discussion forum in the workbook and reminded at the final telehealth session. The Facebook group will be moderated by a member of the research team via the TRACE research Facebook account.</p>

Dietitians administering the intervention will be trained by the principal investigator prior to study implementation. Dietitians will also follow each session as outlined in the manual and keep a dietitian log of participants‚Äô telehealth sessions. Further, five participants allocated to group 1, with their consent, will have all their telehealth sessions audio recorded. The dietitian log and audio recordings will be reviewed by an independent researcher to ensure the intervention was delivered as intended. Regular supervisory meetings will be conducted with the dietitians and study coordinator led by the principal investigator. Participant adherence to the intervention will be assessed by a session attendance checklist completed by a member of the research team. Dietitians administering the telehealth sessions will monitor completion of homework tasks and workbook activities at the start of telehealth sessions 2‚Äì5. Assistance will be provided by the dietitian at this time if participants experienced any difficulties completing the homework tasks/activities. Additionally, to assist with adherence, on completion of each telehealth session, the dietitian will email a personalised ‚ÄòAddictive Eating Action Plan‚Äô, completed on a standardised template, to the participant.</p>

The content of the workbook modules mirrors the content of the five telehealth sessions. In addition to the written materials provided, the workbook contains spaces for reflective activities, documenting goals and monitoring progress. Participants will be asked, on receipt of the workbook, to complete the workbook within a 3-month period.

                  <p>The YFAS 2.0<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> will be used to assess the change in addictive eating symptomatology and severity. The YFAS 2.0 is a validated self-report 35-item questionnaire. The YFAS 2.0 asks participants to think of specific foods they have had difficulty controlling the consumption of within the past 3 months (eg, ice cream, chocolate, chips, hamburgers). The YFAS 2.0 provides an addictive eating symptom score ranging from 0 to 11. Additionally, two items assess clinically significant impairment or distress from eating. A ‚Äòfood addiction diagnosis‚Äô can be given when ‚â•2 symptoms are endorsed, and clinically significant impairment or distress is present. However, for the purpose of this study, a ‚Äòfood addiction diagnosis‚Äô will not be given, and severity of addictive eating will be classified in accordance with YFAS scoring instructions as follows: ‚Äòmild‚Äô=3 symptoms, ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô=4‚Äì5 symptoms or ‚Äòsevere‚Äô=‚â•6 symptoms. The YFAS 2.0 has been found to be a robust and psychometrically sound measure of addictive eating symptomatology in non-clinical<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 67</xref> and clinical populations with good test/retest validity.<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> Preliminary evidence<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> suggests that YFAS scores are sensitive to change and are decreased after intervention.</p>

Through guidance with statisticians, a large effect size was chosen and needed to enable the possibility of a clinically meaningful result. A clinically meaningful difference in symptoms of addictive eating was selected as a decrease of two symptoms, given this would correspond to a change in severity classification on the YFAS 2.0 tool. To detect a mean two-unit difference (SD=2.2) in the YFAS symptoms between the active intervention group and the passive intervention group or control group and using a standardised effect size of d=0.91, a sample size of 32 individuals per group (total sample size n=96) is required to detect this change with a power of 0.90 and a type 1 error rate set at 0.025 to account for multiple testing. However, allowing for a 30% dropout rate from the pilot, a sample size of 46 individuals per group (total sample size n=138) would be required. Therefore, a total sample size of 150 individuals, with 50 per group, was chosen to remain conservative.</p>

For the primary YFAS outcome, a linear mixed model (LMM) will be based on a model with main effects for group (active intervention, passive intervention, control) and time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 3 and 6 months), and the group-by-time interaction. An unstructured residual covariance structure will be used to allow for correlation between the repeated measurements for a subject. The primary outcome effect will be reported as the difference between means at baseline and 3 months, with a 95%‚ÄâCI for the difference. Mental health condition and BMI will be examined for possible moderating effects on the effect size, and if so, adjustment for them will be carried out. Secondary descriptive analysis will be carried out to identify whether specific symptoms were predominantly associated with reductions in YFAS score.</p>
                <p>A secondary outcome will be a categorical variable, clinically significant change from baseline to 3 months, where significant requires a reduction of two or more symptoms in the YFAS. This will be analysed using logistic regression with group being the only factor. Additional secondary outcomes will include dietary outcomes (average daily energy intake, proportion of total energy intake contributed by core food and non-core food intake, macronutrient intake, micronutrient intake and overall diet quality) and mental health status (depression, anxiety and stress scores). These will also be analysed using LMMs as per the approach above. All available data will be used with no imputation of missing values at 3 and 6 months; however, baseline scores will be kept.

                <p>Limitations of the study include the level of experience required of the dietitians administering the telehealth sessions, which may impact the scalability of the intervention. However, dietitians are highly trained professionals in behaviour change and extra care was taken given the uniqueness of the intervention. The fidelity outcomes assessed as part of the trial will provide important information regarding future implementation. Additional limitations include the exclusion of individuals with severe mental illnesses or complex health conditions. The current intervention is not designed for complex comorbidities. It is envisaged that for these individuals, a more complex care model is required where the TRACE Programme could be implemented alongside other approaches or treatments.</p>
                <p>Currently, there are few published interventions run by dietitians and/or other health clinicians for addictive eating demonstrating the clear need for services and trialling of interventions that may be effective at facilitating changes in addictive eating behaviours. The TRACE Programme was designed to raise awareness and support behaviour change of addictive eating. If successful, our study will provide essential evidence regarding the efficacy of behavioural and dietary improvement in the management of addictive eating, thus allowing for the implementation of management strategies for addictive eating into community and clinical healthcare services. Further, if both the active and passive interventions are found to be effective, it will provide evidence of different levels of care that could be used within these services.</p>
