                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Patellofemoral (PF) osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and burdensome subgroup of knee OA, with very little evidence for effective treatments. Prefabricated foot orthoses are an affordable and accessible intervention that have been shown to reduce PF pain in younger adults. Similarities between PF pain and PFOA, as well as our pilot work, suggest that foot orthoses may also be an effective intervention for PFOA. The primary objective of this study is to compare the 3 month efficacy of prefabricated foot orthoses and flat shoe inserts in people with PFOA, on knee pain severity.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The FOOTPATH Study (FOot OrThoses for PAtellofemoral osteoarTHritis) is a multicentre, randomised, participant- and assessor-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups, a 3 month observation period (pre-randomisation) and 12 month follow-up. 160 participants with a clinical diagnosis of PFOA will be recruited from three sites in Australia, and randomised to one of two groups (prefabricated foot orthoses or flat shoe inserts). The primary outcome is worst knee pain severity during a self-nominated aggravating activity in the previous week (100 mm visual analogue scale) at 3 months, with a secondary endpoint at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include global rating of change, symptoms, function, health-related quality of life, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy and use of co-interventions for knee pain. Blinded, intention-to-treat analyses of primary and secondary patient-reported outcomes will be performed, as well as economic analyses.</p>

                  <p>Ethical approval has been granted by La Trobe University’s Human Ethics Committee and The University of Queensland’s Medical Research Ethics Committee. Study outcomes will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations targeting a range of healthcare disciplines and an open access website with clinician resources.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Patellofemoral (PF) osteoarthritis (OA) is an important subgroup of knee OA, whose burden is becoming increasingly evident. Radiographic PFOA is more common than tibiofemoral (TF) OA in people with chronic knee pain (64% to 69% compared with 44% to 45%).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The PF joint is often the first knee joint compartment affected by OA, and increases the risk of TFOA development and progression.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Structural features of PFOA show greater association with knee symptoms than TFOA features. Patellofemoral osteophytes (but not TF osteophytes) are associated with knee pain (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.8),<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and reduced patellar cartilage volume (but not femoral or tibial) is related to greater pain and functional impairment.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Importantly, compared with TFOA, PFOA tends to occur in younger people,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> who often have greater daily physical demands due to occupational and/or childcare responsibilities. Considering the progressive nature of PFOA, the side effects of long-term medication use, and that pain and functional limitations are primary barriers to physical activity<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and indications for total knee replacement,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> interventions that can effectively reduce PFOA pain are urgently required.</p>
              <p>Despite the burden of PFOA, and best-practice guidelines recommending non-surgical, non-drug interventions as the first line strategy for knee OA management,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> there is very little evidence for effective treatments for PFOA. Although combined interventions (eg, PF taping, knee/hip exercises, manual therapy, education)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and knee braces<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> have some evidence of efficacy, their longer-term effects appear to be limited by poor treatment adherence.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> This is particularly relevant for middle-aged adults with PFOA, whose busy lifestyles and family and work commitments are likely to influence adherence to exercise programmes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Issues with knee brace bulkiness and interference with clothing<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> are likely to be barriers to brace wear. For braces and orthoses to be effective, they must be comfortable and unobtrusive to daily living to ensure maximal adherence and patient outcomes.</p>
              <p>Foot orthoses are inserts worn in everyday footwear that are contoured to match the shape of the foot. Prefabricated foot orthoses are affordable and accessible, and are an effective treatment for PF pain in young adults (aged 18 to 40 years).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Based on similarities in symptoms, biomechanics and muscle function between PF pain and PFOA,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref> it is plausible that foot orthoses could also have positive effects in people with PFOA. Pilot data show that people with PFOA (n=23, mean age 59±10 years) report immediate improvements in pain when performing a step-down task with foot orthoses, compared with shoes alone.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We observed high adherence and only transient, minor adverse events in our previous trial of foot orthoses in PF pain,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> suggesting the feasibility of long-term wear. It is therefore timely to conduct a randomised clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate foot orthoses efficacy in this population. The FOOTPATH Study (FOot OrThoses for PAtellofemoral osteoarTHritis) will investigate the efficacy of prefabricated foot orthoses for people with PFOA.</p>

                <p>The FOOTPATH Study is a multicentre, randomised, participant- and assessor-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups, a 3 month observation period (pre-randomisation) and 12 month follow-up. Equal numbers of participants will be randomised to each group, with the primary endpoint of GROC and pain after 3 months. The trial will be conducted across two university sites in Melbourne and Brisbane, Australia, with a satellite site in Hobart, Tasmania.

                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> summarises the flow of participants through the study. Participants will be recruited from the community in Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart and regional Victoria. We will use a multifaceted recruitment strategy that has successfully recruited people of all ages with knee pain in our previous studies. This will include strategies such as paid and free advertisements in local newspapers, community magazines and newsletters (eg, university staff bulletins, seniors newsletters); posters in senior citizen’s centres, golf and bowling clubs and retirement villages; sandwich boards and handouts at community events (eg, fun runs, farmer’s markets); radio and television media releases; mail-outs to health practitioners in recruitment areas (eg, general practitioners, orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists); posts on university and research centre websites (La Trobe University, The University of Queensland); social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter) and patients from the La Trobe University Health Sciences (Podiatry) Clinic, community healthcare centres and hospital waiting lists. Based on recruitment rates of six participants per month during our feasibility trial (single site), as well as known periods of slow recruitment (eg, December/January), conservative estimates indicate that the duration of recruitment will be approximately 20 months. Recruitment rates across all sites will be monitored during the trial, and recruitment strategies adjusted accordingly to meet recruitment targets. There will be no incentives provided to trial investigators or participants for enrolment.</p>

Each participant’s allocated intervention will be revealed to a single investigator (JMT), who will communicate this to the participant’s nominated study practitioner or to the Brisbane site research assistant (GC) who will liaise with local study practitioners. Because we are comparing two shoe inserts with different shapes, it is not possible to blind study practitioners to group allocation. As the primary outcomes are self-reported, participants are considered assessors. To ensure participant (and thus assessor) blinding, consent will involve limited disclosure. As in our recent RCT,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> participants will be informed that they will be randomised to one of two shoe insert interventions, but will not be informed of the treatment elements or our hypotheses. Trial participants will be unblinded once data analyses have been finalised. Because we are evaluating two different shoe inserts known to have minimal associated adverse events,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> it is anticipated that emergency unblinding will not be required.</p>

All study practitioners will fit interventions for participants allocated to both groups. To minimise participant burden, study practitioners will be located at multiple private practice clinics across greater Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart and regional Victoria. To ensure consistency in prescription of foot orthoses and flat shoe inserts, study practitioners will undergo formal training in standardised fitting procedures for both interventions, as used in our previous RCT of prefabricated foot orthoses and flat shoe inserts for young adults with PF pain.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 50</xref> Study practitioners will also be provided with a comprehensive manual and video outlining study procedures, and will have email and phone access to an unblinded investigator to discuss interventions as required (Melbourne, SEM; Brisbane, BV).

The foot orthoses are manufactured from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) of high density (hard, Shore A 70°), medium density (Shore A 55°) and low density (soft, Shore A 45°), and have an inbuilt arch support and 6° varus wedging. A variety of lengths and shapes are available to fit the shape of different footwear. At their first appointment with their chosen study practitioner, participants will bring up to three pairs of shoes that they most commonly wear (eg, work shoes, casual shoes and sports shoes). Study practitioners will fit one pair of foot orthoses to one pair of the participant’s shoes. This will be based on which of the participant’s shoes are able to accommodate the foot orthoses and provide the most support, as prefabricated foot orthoses have superior effects when used with supportive footwear.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Where possible, the orthoses will be able to be transferred across their usual footwear. Study practitioners will ensure that the foot orthoses are comfortable, using procedures used in our previous RCT.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 50</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> outlines the steps involved in the prescription algorithm. The first step involves selection of the type and size of orthoses based on shoe volume and foot length, respectively. Step two involves selection of the hardness of the device, based on participant comfort. If needed, study practitioners will then follow a series of sequential modifications until comfort has been achieved: (1) adding rearfoot varus wedge, (2) adding forefoot varus to the rearfoot varus wedge, (3) removing the rearfoot varus wedge, (4) adding a heel raise and (5) gently heat moulding the orthoses. Comfortable foot orthoses can effectively reduce PF pain in younger adults<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> and are proposed to optimise adherence and potential therapeutic effects. Participants will be given written instructions for using and adapting to the foot orthoses.</p>

                    <p>To reflect current clinical practice and to provide sufficient opportunity to ensure adequate comfort and prescribe additional foot orthoses, participants will attend up to six appointments with the study practitioner in the first 6 weeks of the study. Appointments will be scheduled as follows, where appropriate for individual participants: two appointments in week one, one appointment in week two (with an additional appointment in the same week as needed), one appointment in week three or four and one appointment in week six. Participants will be provided with up to four pairs of foot orthoses, fitted to multiple pairs of commonly worn shoes, in order to maximise wear time.</p>
                    <p>To maximise outcomes of wearing a comfortable, contoured device, participants will receive one pair of sandals (Shore A 50°) from the Vionic range (Vionic, Arundel, Queensland, Australia). Participants will be encouraged to wear these during times that they do not normally wear enclosed footwear that accommodates foot orthoses (eg, at home or during warmer weather). Feedback from our previous RCT in young adults with PF pain<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> indicated that participants often chose to wear sandal-type footwear in warm weather, for a large proportion of the year.

                    <p>Flat shoe inserts will be used as the comparator intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3C</xref>). This is because the contour and wedging of the foot orthoses are proposed to exert mechanical effects on the foot and lower limb, which is thought to be the basis for symptom improvement. Participants will be informed that the study aims to compare two different types of shoe inserts. The flat inserts will be described as an intervention designed to enhance sensory feedback, supported by findings from our previous RCT in PF pain, where those who received flat inserts also experienced improvements in pain over 12 months.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The flat inserts will be the same as those used in our previous RCT, with identical covering fabric to the foot orthoses. To control for gradual contouring that occurs with repeated wear of low-density inserts (a limitation of previous studies), the flat inserts will be made of high-density EVA (Shore A 70°). Standardised guidelines for fitting and follow-up of the flat inserts will aim to ensure these are perceived as a credible intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5</xref>). As with the foot orthoses, participants will be provided with up to four pairs of flat inserts fit to multiple pairs of commonly worn shoes. To address the potential influence of therapist contact, those randomised to this group will also attend an initial appointment with a study practitioner for fitting of flat inserts and up to two follow-up appointments to ensure adequate comfort and fit. At 6 months post-randomisation, a follow-up appointment will be made with the study practitioner to issue new flat inserts, to minimise the effects of cumulative contouring with repeated wear.</p>

                    <p>Intention to treat analyses will be performed, with all randomised participants included regardless of protocol adherence. Blinded analyses of primary and secondary patient-reported outcomes will be performed. The dichotomised measure of GROC will be expressed from blinded analyses as relative risk and number needed to treat, with 95% CI, to facilitate clinical guidelines.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 67</xref> For the primary outcome and continuous secondary outcome measures, linear mixed models (with baseline value as a covariate and treatment condition as a fixed factor) will be used to evaluate the treatment effect and 95% CI at 3 months and 12 months (p&lt;0.05). Linear mixed models utilising repeated measures at all time-points will allow non-biased estimates of treatment effect in the presence of any potential missing cases. This likelihood-based estimation procedure results in non-biased estimates, providing data are missing at random and models are adjusted for any imbalance between groups in potential confounders at baseline (age, sex, weight, symptom duration, PF/TF OA radiographic severity). Relative risk (95% CIs) will be calculated for use of co-interventions and adverse events.</p>

                    <title>Economic evaluation</title>
                    <p>Blinded economic analyses will be conducted to evaluate the 12 month economic efficiency of prefabricated foot orthoses compared with flat shoe inserts, from the societal perspective. Hospitalisations will be converted to costs using the National Weighted Activity Unit costing model. Incremental cost-effectiveness analyses will use the formula ([DC<sub>foot orthoses</sub> + IC<sub>foot orthoses</sub>] – [DC<sub>flat inserts</sub> + IC<sub>flat inserts</sub>] / [E<sub>foot orthoses</sub> – E<sub>flat inserts</sub>]), where DC=mean direct health costs, IC=mean indirect costs, E=effect, <sub>foot orthoses</sub>= foot orthoses group and <sub>flat inserts</sub>=flat insert group. Effect for the primary economic evaluation will be the proportion of participants who ‘improve’ (measured on the GROC) within each group at 12 months. Thus, the cost-effectiveness ratio will reflect the marginal cost per additional ‘improved’ participant from the societal perspective over a 12 month time horizon. Uncertainty in this ratio will be examined by constructing a 95% confidence ellipse on a cost-effectiveness plane and transforming these to cost-effectiveness acceptability curves using non-parametric bootstrap resampling of primary data. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted, varying the threshold of ‘improvement’ on the GROC to reflect increasingly higher thresholds. Quality-adjusted life year scores for each participant (calculated as area under the curve applied to utility measures calculated from EQ-5D) will be substituted for GROC scores as the effect measure, creating an incremental cost-utility ratio to determine the marginal cost per additional quality-adjusted life year for the more effective intervention.</p>

              <p>This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by ethics committees at La Trobe University and The University of Queensland. All participants will provide written informed consent prior to baseline data collection and enrolment in the 3 month observation period. Participant information and consent forms for each phase of the study are included in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>. Participants will undergo knee radiographs at a single time point as part of this trial, ensuring that the amount of ionising radiation is consistent with standard clinical exposure. When prescribed by trained health practitioners, prefabricated foot orthoses and flat shoe inserts are associated with minimal and transient adverse events.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Thus, there are minimal ethical and safety considerations associated with this trial.</p>
              <p>Study outcomes will be widely disseminated through a variety of sources. Primary and key secondary objectives will be submitted to a high-impact peer-reviewed journal in the field. Because study outcomes are applicable to a broad range of health professionals, we will target a general medical journal to facilitate wider dissemination of findings to key stakeholders (eg, general practitioners). Each of the other secondary objectives will be addressed in separate publications and submitted to appropriate journals in the field. Authorship will be in accordance with guidelines provided by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> We will also submit articles to key professional magazines to enhance dissemination to clinicians. Our publication strategy will be complemented by submission of abstracts to key national and international conferences, covering multiple discipline groups (eg, physiotherapy, podiatry, general practice) as well as OA conferences. We will also develop an open access website and resources for clinicians, including videos detailing how to prescribe foot orthoses, and run workshops on PFOA and foot orthoses for registered health professionals. This will facilitate translation of findings to clinical practice, especially practitioners located in rural or remote areas.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>PFOA is a major public health problem and has no cure. Pain and stiffness experienced during daily activities, occupational tasks and exercise can reduce active participation. Importantly, PFOA in middle-aged adults can affect productivity and contribution to society and result in more years of knee pain and disability across the lifespan. Along with direct personal and economic costs of PFOA, indirect costs associated with consequences of physical inactivity are a major burden on health expenditure.</p>
              <p>This RCT will be the first to evaluate patient-reported benefits of foot orthoses – a simple, low-cost, low-risk intervention that is widely accessible to people with PFOA. Findings of efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prefabricated foot orthoses could represent a turning point in the effective long-term management of PFOA. When worn in everyday and exercise footwear, foot orthoses have the potential to reduce pain every time the foot hits the ground, substantially increasing an individual’s capacity and motivation to be physically active. This has important implications for maintenance of general and mental health with increasing age. Importantly, the ease of daily use of foot orthoses, with minimal patient burden, is likely to maximise adherence, enhance outcomes and reduce reliance on health practitioner resources.</p>
