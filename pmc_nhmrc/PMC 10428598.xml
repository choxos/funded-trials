                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Public transport users tend to accumulate more physical activity than non-users; however, whether physical activity is increased by financially incentivising public transport use is unknown. The <italic>trips4health</italic> study aimed to determine the impact of an incentive-based public transport intervention on physical activity.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A single-blinded randomised control trial of a 16-week incentive-based intervention involved Australian adults who were infrequent bus users (â¥â18Â years; used busââ¤â2 times/week) split equally into intervention and control groups. The intervention group were sent weekly motivational text messages and awarded smartcard bus credit when targets were met. The intervention group and control group received physical activity guidelines. Accelerometer-measured steps/day (primary outcome), self-reported transport-related physical activity (walking and cycling for transport) and total physical activity (min/week and MET-min/week) outcomes were assessed at baseline and follow-up.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Due to the COVID pandemic, the trial was abandoned prior to target sample size achievement and completion of all assessments (<italic>N</italic>â=â110). Steps/day declined in both groups, but by less in the intervention group [-557.9 steps (-7.9%) vs.-1018.3 steps/week (-13.8%)]. In the intervention group, transport-related physical activity increased [80.0Â min/week (133.3%); 264.0 MET-min/week (133.3%)] while total physical activity levels saw little change [35.0Â min/week (5.5%); 25.5 MET-min/week (1.0%)]. Control group transport-related physical activity decreased [-20.0Â min/week (-27.6%); -41.3 MET-min/week (-17.3%)], but total physical activity increased [260.0Â min/week (54.5%); 734.3 MET-min/week (37.4%)].</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This study found evidence that financial incentive-based intervention to increase public transport use is effective in increasing transport-related physical activity These results warrant future examination of physical activity incentives programs in a fully powered study with longer-term follow-up.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">Physical inactivity is one of the most significant contributing factors of ill-health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Australia only 24.5% of adults aged 18â64Â years met Australian Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines of 150Â min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and two or more days containing strength-based training each week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is an important need for the development of strategies and interventions to increase physical activity levels as Australian physical activity levels have remained stagnant across the last four decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Relative to leisure-time physical activity, there has been limited investigation of interventions to increase transport-related physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Transport-related physical activity, also known as active transport, consists of healthy means of travel such as walking and cycling (independent or coupled with public or private transport). Due to a need to transit from one place to another (i.e., a necessary and often habitual activity) transport-related physical activity has been identified as a domain in which overall physical activity levels may be increased via the incorporation of physical activity into daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">The potential contribution of public transport use (such as train/rail, ferry, and bus) towards transport-related physical activity and physical activity is largely realised through additional incidental walking (and potentially cycling in certain contexts) associated with access/egress. In general, people are willing to walk 5â10Â min to a stop/station, although this is subject to a range of factors pertaining to the type of service, trip purpose etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In our earlier study of Tasmanian bus users, bus passengers self-reported walking 37.8Â min per week on average to and from bus stops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Evidently, an increase of even one bus trip per week has the potential for large physical activity gains, at a population level, with each additional public transport trip per week estimated to require 5â15Â min of walking to reach a bus stop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As such, transport-related physical activity as a result of public transport use may provide an opportune behavioural target for increasing overall physical activity. Operating through the dual process theory of habituation (i.e., where the conscious decision to use public transport results in the unconscious undertaking of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), public transport promotion provides an opportunity to increase physical activity levels via a habitual association with daily commutes. However, understanding of how public transport use, and consequently transport-related physical activity may be increased, is limited.</p>
              <p id="Par15">One promising method of intervention is the incentivisation of physical activity through financial reward. Previously, financial incentive-based intervention has been successfully applied to alter health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], including vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and leisure-time physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Grounded in behavioural economics, incentive-based intervention acknowledges the tendency to favour more immediate than long term motivations and instead provides an immediate reward (financial gain) as a key motivator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is upon these principles, along with input from policy and practice partners, that the <italic>trips4health</italic> study, a single-blinded randomised control trial (RCT) was designed. <italic>trips4health</italic> aimed to determine the impact of a financial incentive-based strategy on transport-related and total physical activity via increased public transport use.</p>
              <p id="Par16">It was hypothesised that intervention group participants would increase steps taken each day and levels of self-reported transport-related physical activity (thus increasing total physical activity), compared to control group participants.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par17">The<italic> trips4health</italic> study was a single-blinded RCT involving adults undertaking infrequent public transport use (â¤â2 trips per week) in the state capital (greater Hobart region) of Tasmania, Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Within this region, public transport was comprised of only bus services, predominantly offered by one provider, Metro Tasmania Pty. Ltd. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Using an incentive-based intervention, the <italic>trips4health</italic> study provided an immediate reward (financial gain) as a motivator for the uptake of public transport usage. The study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], acceptability and feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and positive impact on bus use in the control vs intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has been described in detail elsewhere; process evaluation findings indicated that the <italic>trips4health</italic> study demonstrated strong fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par18">Recruitment of participants from the Hobart area began in September 2019 using convenience methods including bus advertising, both social and traditional media promotion, word-of-mouth, workplace promotion, and promotion amongst professional networks. The study was abandoned after approximately one third of the target sample had been recruited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, a state of emergency was announced by the Tasmanian government, and social restrictions enacted (all Tasmanians were asked to stay at home and schools moved to online learning); consequently, the <italic>trips4health</italic> recruitment process was placed on hold in March 2020 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Follow-up assessments continued in a non-face-to-face format for those that completed the intervention phase prior to the study being paused â this only resulted in alterations to clinical assessments as self-reported participant characteristics and physical activity measures were assessed online electronically at baseline. Due to extensive social changes necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, safety concerns, and questions of study validity (participants choosing not to undertake transport-related physical activity due to social changes and/or safety concerns despite entering the intervention phase of the study) investigators chose to abandon the RCT and cease assessments in June 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Timeline of trips4health and COVID-19 related changes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12966_2023_1500_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par19">Ethics approval was granted by the Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H0017820, 27 March 2019).

                <p id="Par21">Potential participants were excluded if any of the following criteria were met: (e1) intention to move house or work location whereby a bus service in the greater Hobart region will be inaccessible within the 10-month study period; (e2) currently engaged in or planning to engage in other incentive-based programs to enhance public transport use; (e3) pregnancy; (e4) a health condition that prevents walking; (e5) a health condition that prevents bus use; (e6) planned activity that would prevent bus use for greater than two weeks during the four month intervention phase of the 10Â month study period (e.g. surgery, extended holiday).</p>
                <p id="Par22">Participant consent was provided electronically through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Version 8.5.19, Nashville, Tennessee, USA) or in person with research staff when attending the first clinic visit (T1).</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par23">The <italic>trips4health</italic> study involved a four-month incentive-based program to increase public transport use between T1 (0Â months [baseline]), and T2 (4Â months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The four month intervention phase allowed three months for behaviour change to become ingrained and a further month for maintenance, over which text-message contact and support was reduced and withdrawn in preparation for intervention cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A six-month maintenance phase (T3, 10Â months) was planned to follow the intervention phase but was not undertaken due to the COVID instigated abandonment of the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par24">All participants (irrespective of group allocation) received smartcard credit as study compensation. Compensation was commensurate with participation and independent of incentive scheme: completion of the baseline assessment (T1)â=â$5 credit and completion of the post-intervention follow-up assessment (T2)â=â$10 credit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par25">The intervention used a âgain-framedâ approach which rewards positive behaviours. Participants were set weekly bus trip targets from weeks 1â16 and, if intervention group participants met their target number of bus trips, bus trip credit (financial incentive) was issued to their smartcard. The number of target trips increased over time; with this escalation, financial incentives also increased (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Table S3).</p>
                <p id="Par26">Participants were set a target of five one-way bus trips per week by the end of the intervention phase. The credit (incentive) received was equal to the value of the weekly trip target (adjusted to the participantâs usual fare type) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Each week, participants were notified by email whether they met their trip target, the smartcard credit they have received (if any), and their trip target for the following week. To assist in the achievement of weekly targets, and support the retention of public transport-use following the cessation of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], additional behaviour change support was delivered to intervention group participants in weekly text messages informing participants of the consequences of transport-related physical activity behaviours, goal setting, and providing social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These text messages were developed using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy, informed by previous research assessing transport behaviour and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and a prior incentive-based study designed to increase weekly leisure-time physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">Both the intervention and control groups received printed versions of the Australian Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Educational materials were to assist in the retention and engagement of both the control and intervention groups but are unlikely to influence physical activity behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par28">The primary outcome was change in median daily step count. This was assessed via ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers worn on the right hip for seven days at baseline (T1) and immediately post-intervention (week 17/18; T2; primary endpoint). Median daily step count (steps/day) was then derived using ActiLife v6.13.3 analysis software (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA).</p>
                <p id="Par29">The secondary outcomes of change in self-reported transport-related physical activity and total physical activity (minutes/week and MET-minutes/week) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire -long version (IPAQ-L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Frequency, intensity, duration, and type of physical activity completed in the previous week was reported, from which self-reported minutes/week and MET-minutes/week of transport-related physical activity undertaken were then calculated according to the IPAQ data processing and analysis protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Transport-related physical activity was contextualising within the IPAQ-L as travel âfrom place to place, including to places like work, stores, movies, and so on.â</p>
                <p id="Par30">Tertiary outcomes of change in self-reported leisure-time physical activity (minutes/week and MET-minutes/week) and sedentary time (min/day) were assessed via IPAQ-L. An objective assessment of sedentary time (min/day) was also determined using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers.</p>

Participant characteristics of each group were presented as means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and as percentages and frequencies for categorical variables. Physical activity outcomes at baseline and follow-up were presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Two analyses were performed: all participants that completed T1 baseline physical activity assessment were included within the primary analysis (using multiple imputation), while only those that had also completed the 16-week intervention and T2 follow-up assessments were included within the supplementary complete-case analysis. Missing data at follow-up was addressed via multiple imputation using chained equations using fully conditional specification; assuming missing at random 20 imputations were produced. Analysis of change was then performed to compare differences in average daily step count (primary outcome), total self-reported physical activity and transport-related physical activity levels at follow-up between control and intervention groups.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par46">The <italic>trips4health</italic> study is the first RCT to examine the impact of an incentives-based intervention on public transport use for physical activity gain. While a lack of statistical power due to the COVID pandemic makes firm conclusions difficult, contrary to our hypothesis, the median number of steps/day decreased from baseline to follow-up in both treatment groups, but the greatest decrease was observed in the control group. Self-reported transport-related physical activity only increased among the intervention group suggesting some effectiveness of a financial incentive on this physical activity domain; however total physical activity levels decreased among the intervention group while increasing among the control group. Despite the COVID-19 related limitations experienced in this study, these findings for physical activity in combination with our previous observations demonstrating the feasibility of financial incentive to increase bus use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] warrant further investigation via a fully powered trial.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Despite the established positive relationships between public transport and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], in the current study accelerometer derived steps/day decreased from baseline to follow-up in both treatment groups. The reason for this decline is unclear but is possibly resultant of a reduction in public transport use (and subsequently the number of steps undertaken to access public transport) due to concerns of safety arising from the escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Further, as steps/day was representative of total physical activity, it is possible that this decline may be explained by reductions in occupational and leisure-time activity, driven by COVID-19 work-from-home and stay-home mandates. However, following adjustment for baseline values, a smaller decrease in steps/day was observed among intervention participants compared to those of the control group, suggesting that the financial incentive may have mitigated some declines in physical activity.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Self-reported transport-related physical activity (min/week and MET-min/week) increased among intervention participants by 133.3% while transport-related physical activity of the control group decreased from baseline to follow-up. The differences in self-reported transport-related physical activity (non-significant) between control and intervention group participants may be attributed to the greater number of public transport trips undertaken as a result of the intervention, as commutes between bus stops and destinations constitute transport-related physical activity. In line with the hypothesised dual-process theory mechanism, findings of increased transport-related physical activity performance mirror Cleland et al.âs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] observations that the financial incentive afforded within the trips4health study yielded an increased number of public transport trips. Due to the target of the intervention (public transport use) transport-related physical activity is conceptually the domain of physical activity in which changes in activity levels would be expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">The self-reported total physical activity levels of the control group increased in both the min/week and MET-min/week undertaken. While a small increase in MET-min/week of total physical activity was reported among the intervention group, a decrease in min/week total physical activity was observed. The intervention groupâs increase in transport-related physical activity and relatively unaltered total physical activity suggests the potential for a compensatory mechanism. These patterns are similar to those of the <italic>ActivityStat</italic> hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], in which an increase or decrease in one physical activity domain results in a compensatory change in another domain (e.g., transport-related physical activity increases, leisure-time physical activity decreases) thus, resulting in a relatively unchanged total physical activity level. Within this study, transport-related physical activity undertaken by intervention group participants increased by 80.0Â min/week, yet the total physical activity of the participants decreased by 35.0Â min/week.</p>
              <p id="Par50">While some studies provide evidence of both individual short-term and population-wide secular compensatory mechanisms between physical activity domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], others are inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], suggest no compensation occurs, or observe that increases in one physical activity domain may yield increases in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These findings add to the already debated field of literature discussing the relationships between physical activity domains.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par51">This study had some limitations. Importantly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the full sample size was not attained, resulting in a lack of statistical power to detect differences between groups. Further, rising concerns regarding COVID-19 during the study period could have impacted on transport and physical activity behaviours. As such, this analysis was unable to draw firm conclusions about the findings, although these data provide some indication of a positive effect and help to inform future studies. COVID-19 also resulted in the abandonment of the planned further post-intervention (6-months) follow-up; thus, it could not be determined whether public transport behaviours would become a more normalised and integrated behaviour over time. The generalisability of this study to the broader population may be limited due to an over-representation of tertiary educated and female participants. The single-blinded design meant that study participants were aware of their group allocation (intervention or control). It must be noted that accelerometer and self-reported physical activity measures differed within this study. For example, it is possible that the control groupâs increase in total self-reported physical activity and decrease in ambulatory steps/day is due to activity being undertaken that contributed to total physical activity levels that was not assessable by accelerometer (e.g., cycling, swimming, weightlifting, etc.). The outcomes of transport-related physical activity and total physical activity are prone to limitations due to their self-reported nature. While group allocation had not occurred at T1, participants were aware of their group at the T2 follow-up assessment, which may have biased reported activity levels. However, the use of accelerometers limit potential group allocation bias by providing an objective measure of activity for consideration alongside subjective self-report. There was potential for reactivity bias during the use of accelerometers to measure activity; However, the assessment of activity across a seven-day period and the analysis of the median steps/day over this period act to negate this potential bias. Further, as accelerometers were mailed to participants at T2 rather that administered face-to-face (as at T1), compliance with instruction of use may have been lower.</p>
                <p id="Par52">A key strength of this study was its randomised and controlled study design. Further, its use of both objective and subjective measures of physical activity were important strengths. Accelerometers are an accurate and reliable objective measure of both step count and physical activity frequency, intensity, and duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This study also assessed physical activity subjectively using the IPAQ-L, a widely implemented survey that has been shown to be both valid and reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], which allowed for the separation of transport-related and leisure-time physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The use of multiple imputation strengthened the analysis by allowing for the consideration of missing outcome data.</p>
