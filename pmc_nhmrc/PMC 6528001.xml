                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Hysterectomy is the most common major gynaecological procedure in women and minimally invasive approaches should be used wherever possible; total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) is one such surgical approach which allows removal of the uterus entirely laparoscopically. However, lack of surgical training opportunities is impeding its increased adoption. This study will formally test a surgical outreach training model to equip surgeons with the skills to provide TLH as an alternative to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH).</p>

              <p>Hysterectomy is the most common major gynaecological procedure in women.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Reviews and meta-analyses<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref> conclude that minimally invasive approaches should be preferred over total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), and should be considered whenever clinically possible.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 7–11</xref>
</p>
              <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG), American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL), Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) have all published guidelines highlighting the benefits of minimally invasive surgery for women with benign and malignant gynaecological conditions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Despite the evidence base supporting minimally invasive approaches, and the recommendations by professional societies to decrease TAH, almost 40% of hysterectomies in Australia are still performed using this approach, and a similar proportion of cases are done using a vaginal approach.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

              <p>Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) is a minimally invasive surgical approach to remove the uterus, with or without the adnexae, to treat benign gynaecological conditions such as uterine fibroids and adenomyosis or to prevent or treat cancers of the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. TLH was developed to allow the surgery to be completed entirely laparoscopically,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> and has been shown to be feasible and safe; compared with TAH, TLH is associated with improved recovery, shorter hospital stay, reduced risk of surgical complications<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 15–18</xref> and equivalent disease-free outcomes for treating endometrial cancer.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 19–22</xref> While TLH is a slightly more costly procedure than TAH, TLH has been shown to be cost-effective when the total cost of care is considered.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 19</xref> Robotic hysterectomy is an alternative approach to hysterectomy used in some highly developed countries, especially the USA. However, its use in other countries, including Australia, is still limited due to the significant costs associated with robotic technology.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–26</xref>

              <title>Rationale</title>
              <p>To investigate why TAH was still commonly used, a survey of Australian and New Zealand gynaecologists identified two main barriers impeding the uptake of TLH: (1) surgeons’ lack of procedural skills for TLH and (2) the limited availability of structured training and mentoring opportunities to assist practising surgeons to gain those skills.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Women who have had a hysterectomy were surveyed and reported that they commonly follow the advice of their doctor with regards to the type of hysterectomy, and rarely reported to seek a second opinion.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</p>
              <p>International evidence shows that structured education and training is effective in decreasing the use of TAH; in Finland, between 1996 and 2006, the proportion of hysterectomies conducted by TAH reduced from 58% to 24% through training and education. In parallel, postoperative complications also decreased significantly.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 29</xref> In Canada, between 2005 and 2012, the proportion of hysterectomies conducted by TLH increased from 40% to 74% through stakeholder engagement and structured learning.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</p>
              <p>In Australia, no other formal training programme exists to teach advanced laparoscopic techniques, including laparoscopy; this study will implement and evaluate a model of training for practising gynaecologists in TLH.</p>

                  <p>The first phase of the training model involves selection of the training-hospital, using the <italic>hospital selection tool</italic> questionnaire; identification of appropriate surgical mentors, using the <italic>surgical trainer/mentor selection tool</italic> questionnaire; and selection of appropriate surgical trainees (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>
                  <p>All SMs attend a TLH train-the-trainer course; this practical course teaches surgical coaching skills and aims to equip the attendees as trainers. The course was adapted from existing train-the-trainers courses in flexible endoscopy and laparoscopic colorectal surgery.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref>
</p>
                  <p>To maintain surgical volume for the trainees, a maximum of three STs may be trained simultaneously, the remaining surgeons not selected for TLH training support their colleagues in the training, and offer their hysterectomy cases to ensure that sufficient training cases are available; in return, non-selected surgeons are offered the same benefits to them in the future. Once these steps have been completed, a faculty focus meeting is held at the training hospital, during which information on surgical case load and key outcomes such as conversions at baseline are reviewed, and organisational/surgical trainee barriers to the adoption of TLH are discussed. This includes important practical concerns such as providing sufficient training cases to the STs, having a dedicated theatre that would be exempt from surgical target pressures, an anaesthetist that would support a reversed Trendelenburg position for laparoscopic surgery and all necessary equipment available to make the training feasible. To ensure that nursing staff, as well as the STs, gain experience and expertise, the SM, department head and the nursing theatre managers identify two scrub nurses to be involved throughout the training process. Attendance is also offered to anaesthetic staff.</p>

                  <title>Preceptorship</title>
                  <p>Preceptorship aims to demonstrate the flow of TLH in a well-performing team and surgical environment, it shows visual aspects of the procedure and surgical setup, the atmosphere in theatre and the sound levels that the STs should aim for when proficient.</p>
                  <p>Preceptorship is provided in two stages: stage 1 involves a 1-day workshop attended by three STs and two local surgical scrub nurses. The topics comprise composition of a surgical team, surgical setup, positioning of equipment, primary and secondary port placement, surgeon’s posture, effective use of laparoscopic instruments and an overview of the steps of the TLH procedure. During this stage, the SM also explains study procedures, ensures baseline surveys are completed, and explains how to use the database for recording AEs. Stage 2 involves the STs and the nursing staff attending a live TLH. The SM acts as the lead surgeon, and through demonstration reinforces the topics covered in stage 1 of preceptorship while introducing the team to each practical step of the TLH. Each surgery is video-recorded and used to facilitate a postsurgery debrief discussion between the SM and the team.</p>

                <sec id="s4h3">
                  <title>Proctorship</title>
                  <p>Proctored training consists of up to 10 training days conducted by the SM, with up to three TLH procedures conducted per day; it is provided in a dedicated training theatre at the STs’ hospital using an identical configuration to that used in the preceptorship stages. The SM introduces themselves to everyone in the operating theatre, explains the aim of the day’s session and then checks the equipment. The patient is brought into the operating room, the SM supervises the patient positioning, discusses equipment, setup and port placement. The SM and STs agree on a set of <italic>stopping rules—</italic>if/when a member of the surgical team calls for a <italic>stop</italic>, the operation will be paused. A <italic>stop</italic> is typically called to pause and provide an opportunity to explain anatomy or a surgical procedural step. Not adhering to the <italic>stop</italic> may translate into a lost opportunity for learning. A <italic>stop</italic> call does not necessarily translate into the operation being taken over by the SM.</p>
                  <p>During proctorship, the SM acts as the primary surgeon for the first case, with the STs acting as surgical assistants. For subsequent cases, the SM acts as surgical assistant; to avoid fatigue and exhaustion, for the first two training days, the STs perform only part of the procedure. As needed, the SM takes over to demonstrate specific procedural steps. As the STs become increasingly familiar with the TLH technique, the active involvement of the SM decreases, eventually just being present in the operating room supervising and demonstrating on the screen. Proctorship is the longest and most demanding component of TLH training. One of the challenges is for the trainees to renounce previously developed habits which are incompatible with a TLH operation.</p>
                  <p>During the training period, the SM may approve that the STs could assist each other with TLHs outside of the regular proctored surgical training days, subject to them providing the mentor with updates on surgical outcomes.</p>
                  <p>As with the preceptorship stage, to allow debriefing and to illustrate learning points, a video recording of each case is made. During debriefing, the SM provides detailed feedback to the STs, and the STs provide feedback on the SMs training, ideas to enhance the experience and goals they would like to set for the next session.</p>
                  <p>Following each surgical training day, the STs are provided with tasks to complete before the next session. These tasks include reviewing videos of TLH procedures, active watching of tutorial videos and writing of affirmations on how to complete specific surgical tasks. Between training days, the surgical mentor is available to answer questions from the trainees by email.</p>
                  <p>Formative assessments of both the STs and SM are conducted after each case including completing The Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills tool. These assessments help the ST to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and to target areas for improvement; they also allow the SM to adapt their coaching style as needed.</p>

                <title>Phase 3: programme evaluation</title>
                <p>The programme is evaluated by: examining the surgical outcomes of the patients who underwent surgery during the training programme, experiences of the STs; experiences of the SM; the theatre staff, hospital staff and other relevant stakeholders involved in the training programme. Qualitative interviews with nursing and theatre staff will allow assessment of the benefits of the training programme for their practice, and any barriers that the whole theatre team may envisage for a future rollout of training. By comparing the surgical outcomes of patients treated during the training programme with those of expert surgeons, it will be determined whether the treatment that patients received was equivalent to best practice. A summative assessment of Satisfaction with Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Training Programme is completed by each ST at the conclusion of the programme. Semistructured interviews are conducted to explore participants’ knowledge attitudes, and reflections about the programme, the integration of the new surgical skills into day-to-day practice, the ability of the programme to induce change in surgical approach, views on whether the training was successful and skills will be maintained and whether the programme could be used for future training. Interviews are recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. In parallel to collecting TAH rates, those of hysterectomies done vaginally, using a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal or TLH approach will also be collected from before intervention throughout to follow-up.</p>

The satisfaction with the training programme rating scales will be summarised to provide a mean score (SD) for each of the sections related to the trainer/mentor, the hospital/peer support, overall training, training objectives as well a summary score overall. To assess the unadjusted and adjusted strength of association between participants’ satisfaction with the programme, and trainer, trainee or hospital characteristics linear, logistic or generalised linear regression models will be fitted, depending on the distribution of the outcome variable.</p>

                <p>Before planning the IMAGINE trial, we conducted interviews with 10 women who had had a hysterectomy in the past, and then surveyed over 2600 women, which helped inform the rationale for the study. Each year, we hold a patient forum to inform women about the ongoing research conducted by the Queensland Centre for Gynaecological Cancer. We also provide updated written summaries on our public facing website, and send biannual newsletters to patients and interested members of the public.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The IMAGINE trial is innovative; it will formally test a structured training model intended to develop advanced laparoscopic competency in gynaecological surgeons, so that they may complete a hysterectomy entirely laparoscopically.</p>
              <p>Hysterectomy is the most common major gynaecological surgical procedure (almost 30 000 cases/year in Australia).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While high-level evidence is available to suggest that compared with less invasive approaches, TAH is associated with inferior health outcomes,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11 15–20 22</xref> a significant proportion of women still receive TAH. It has been proposed that increasing the adoption of TLH would reduce the rate of TAH and subsequently improve surgical outcomes as well as provide significant cost savings for funders of healthcare.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 30</xref>
</p>
              <p>In previous work, we interviewed and surveyed Australian gynaecologists.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It is apparent that Australian gynaecologists prefer to offer the hysterectomy through a vaginal approach; however, if a vaginal approach is infeasible, many resort to an open, abdominal surgical approach. Only a minority of Australian gynaecological surgeons considered themselves sufficiently trained to offer patients a TLH, and this lack of training is the main impediment to them offering TLH as an alternative to TAH. We also surveyed women who had a hysterectomy, as active querying by patients to received TLH may contribute to a change in hysterectomy approach used. However, we found that women mainly knew about TAH, tended to follow the recommendation by their doctor and rarely sought a second opinion. Therefore, patient pressure was unlikely to facilitate a quicker move to TLH, and providing gynaecological surgeons with training to allow them to confidently offer TLH to their patients was the most promising strategy.</p>
              <p>Information is abundant on the assessment of surgical skills in specialist trainees and specialists,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> quantifying the surgical skills required for laparoscopic hysterectomy<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> and documenting improved surgical skills from baseline through training. The UK programme on laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery has reported extensively about the key elements and outcomes of the training programme.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41–43</xref> However, comparatively little information is available in the literature about how surgical training processes for practising consultant gynaecological surgeons may be established at an organisational level. The research study described here aims to close that evidence gap.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>If successful, this training model will equip surgeons with the skills to offer a minimally invasive approach to hysterectomy which will translate into better care for women, while reducing health system costs. The findings may be useful in informing a scaled-up model for laparoscopic gynaecological surgical training.</p>
