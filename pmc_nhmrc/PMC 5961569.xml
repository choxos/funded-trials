                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Prevention of overweight and obesity in childhood is a priority because of associated acute and chronic conditions in childhood and later in life, which place significant burden on health systems. Evidence suggests prevention should engage a range of actions and actors and target multiple levels. The Whole of Systems Trial Of Prevention <underline>S</underline>trategies for childhood obesity (WHO STOPS) will evaluate the outcomes of a novel systems-based intervention that aims to engage whole communities in a locally led multifaceted response. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of WHO STOPS and examines the methodological challenges for economic evaluation of a complex systems-based intervention.</p>

                  <p>Economic evaluation alongside a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial in regional and rural communities in Victoria, Australia. Cost-effectiveness and cost–utility analyses will provide estimates of the incremental cost (in $A) per body mass index unit saved and quality adjusted life year gained. A Markov cohort model will be employed to estimate healthcare cost savings and benefits over the life course of children. The dollar value of community resources harnessed for the community-led response will be estimated. Probabilistic uncertainty analyses will be undertaken to test sensitivity of results to plausible variations in all trial-based and modelled variables. WHO STOPS will also be assessed against other implementation considerations (such as sustainability and acceptability to communities and other stakeholders).</p>

                  <p>The trial is registered by the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616000980437). Full ethics clearances have been received for all methods described below: Deakin University’s Human Research Ethics Committee 2014-279, Deakin University’s Human Ethics Advisory Group-Health (HEAG-H) HEAG-H 194_2014, HEAG-H 17 2015, HEAG-H 155_2014, HEAG-H 197_2016, HEAG-H 118_2017, the Victorian Department of Education and Training 2015_002622 and the Catholic Archdiocese of Ballarat. Trial findings (including economic evaluation) will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. Collected data and analyses will be made available in accordance with journal policies and study ethics approvals. Results will be presented to relevant government authorities with an interest in cost-effectiveness of these types of interventions.</p>

              <p>Childhood obesity causes a range of acute and chronic conditions reducing mental and physical health and well-being.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Obese children are at higher risk of becoming obese adults, a major risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4 5</xref> WHO estimates that 23% of children living in developed countries are overweight or obese.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In Australia, the most recent National Health Survey (2014–2015) indicates that 27% of children aged 7–12 years are overweight or obese.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It is estimated the direct costs of obesity to the health system were $8.6 billion in the 2011/2012 financial year.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Preventing the onset of overweight and obesity during childhood could improve physical and psychological well-being, and education outcomes for children, and reduce the health burden and healthcare costs during childhood and later life.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref>
</p>
              <p>While many different types of interventions to prevent or treat childhood obesity have been trialled,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> these have generally shown limited feasibility and/or success. In the absence of successful interventions, invasive procedures such as bariatric surgery have increasingly been used to reduce body mass index (BMI) in teens with obesity as well as children as young as 9 years.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, these procedures are costly to the health system and are a high risk rather than population-level solution.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Downstream interventions targeting at-risk children and their parents through screening and provision of primary-care-based interventions have generally been ineffective in reducing BMI.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Of the more upstream interventions, few achieved reductions in the BMI of children,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and those that did, have not demonstrated long-term benefits.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 17</xref> The most promising strategies for preventing childhood obesity appear to be multifaceted—engaging a range of actions and actors to target multiple risk factors across multiple levels (eg, individuals, schools and whole communities).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 18</xref>
</p>
              <p>Building on the existing evidence, the Whole of Systems Trial Of Prevention Strategies for childhood obesity (WHO STOPS) will evaluate the impact of a novel intervention that aims to engage whole communities in a locally led multifaceted response.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This systems-based intervention is underpinned by systems thinking<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> and collective impact.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 22</xref> WHO STOPS aims to reduce childhood BMI-z and obesity prevalence by supporting community leaders to change food and physical activity (PA) environments and related behaviours.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p>
              <p>Assessing cost-effectiveness of new interventions is critical to priority setting and funding decisions.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> There are few trials employing systems-based thinking for childhood obesity prevention and consequently little rigorous evaluation of cost-effectiveness of these approaches.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This is due to the relatively recent emergence of this approach to childhood obesity prevention and also the methodological challenges for economic evaluation, where well-established economic evaluation frameworks provide only limited guidance on assessing complex and adaptive interventions.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> That said, modelling and trial-based evidence suggests multifaceted preventive strategies—particularly targeting schools—have real potential to be cost-effective,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref> making the case for a rigorous economic evaluation of WHO STOPS. This paper presents a protocol (incorporating a discussion of key challenges) for the economic evaluation of the WHO STOPS childhood obesity intervention to address the research question:</p>

                  <p>The WHO STOPS process uses a collective impact approach,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 22</xref> which seeks to identify and support a local ‘backbone’ organisation that will take significant responsibility for fostering, supporting and monitoring the community-led actions (described in component 3). It is anticipated that this role will include facilitating WHO STOPS action planning and review meetings, tracking and providing feedback of community-led actions to the community. During a pilot testing phase in a proximal, comparable town, the backbone organisation was a locally based public health organisation that allocated personnel time to these tasks.</p>
                  <p>Components 1 and 2 capture the reproducible element of the intervention and will be directly facilitated by the implementation specialists from the WHO STOPS research team. The timing of the establishment of the backbone organisation, however, may occur prior to, during or after component 1. The end of the whole of community session(s), where community-led actions are agreed on, will mark the full implementation of the intervention dose.</p>

The aim will be to undertake numerous actions across multiple points in the community, thereby addressing a range of obesity-related risk factors. Actions might be led by community organisations (including local government, health services, schools and sporting clubs), businesses, community groups or individuals. Any resources required to implement the proposed actions will be sourced by communities, primarily from within existing community resources. This strategy will result in component 3 being unique in each of the five intervention communities.</p>

              <sec id="s3a">
                <title>Defining the intervention</title>
                <p>From the funder/organiser perspective, the intervention could be viewed as limited to component 1, with the establishment of a backbone organisation (component 2) and the range of community actions generated (component 3)—important intermediate outcomes. However, from a broader societal perspective, those (component 3) community actions are a prerequisite for obesity-related behaviour change and as such can be considered an active component of the intervention. From this perspective, understanding the resources harnessed from within the community to affect any potential change in childhood overweight and obesity is important. Adding further complexity, each community will develop its own non-prescribed set of actions—as a result of differing priorities (determined via component 1), and at least partly as a result of the capacity provided by their backbone organisation and the approach it takes. As a result, each community’s component 3 will be unique, non-standardised and tailored to its own specific needs and resource capacity.</p>

              <sec id="s3b">
                <title>Assessing the costs</title>
                <p>While costing components 1 and 2 will be relatively straightforward, the task of costing component 3 will be large and complex. Implemented actions (component 3) will occur across numerous sectors/settings (eg, health, education, local government, transport, local commerce, sport and recreation), making identification of costs difficult. Implementing parties may be well defined (eg, local department of health, local municipal government, school, sports club) or smaller and informal (eg, households or a group of parents). Beyond identification, ‘best practice’ microcosting of the potentially hundreds of discrete actions that may result across multiple communities is not feasible given this and most research projects’ resource constraints.</p>
                <p>Attributing costs of a community action to the intervention in itself provides challenges particularly when:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>An action has a set of aims and/or target group broader than children.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An action was motivated by observing other activities in theirs or other communities, rather than resulting from participation at the original community GMB sessions (ie, how many degrees of separation should be allowed for spin-off actions to be included?).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention was only a tipping point, where years of community attention afforded a given action brought the community to a point of readiness to implement.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An action is somewhat distal to the primary aim of the intervention but was identified as an obesity-related risk factor by that community (eg, targeting parental drug and alcohol use to improve parenting skills).</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>While not unique to this intervention, this research is part of a much larger research effort and there is a genuine risk of overburdening community members with data collection at the risk of undermining community support.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The costing method applied requires achievement of a balance between data comprehensiveness, feasibility and community sensitivity.</p>

                <p>The benefits of the whole of systems intervention may extend beyond the primary outcome and target population. For example, any resulting improvement in a child’s eating and PA behaviours may extend to other household members,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> or the strengthening of a community’s networks and leadership may improve its capacity to address other health and non-health related issues.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Further, the intervention may result in multiple community actions, which are iterative in their development and interact in a non-linear fashion creating intended and unintended consequences, either of a positive or negative nature.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> Such a systems-based intervention seeks to create ‘system shifts’ and establish new societal norms around obesity-related behaviours; predicting the nature and extent of change beyond the trial period is difficult. These innovative intervention strategies require novel assessment techniques or adaptation of existing methods. Scenario analyses using system dynamics models<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> may provide a framework to predict the likelihood of such system shifts (the potential use of which will be explored in this trial).</p>

                <title>Economic evaluation overview</title>
                <p>A cost-effectiveness evaluation will be conducted with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios calculated for the cost ($A) per BMI unit saved and quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results will be analysed at the commencement of step 2 implementation (2019), when a comparison of the intervention versus current practice can be made. Results will also be analysed after 4 years (2 years post step 2 implementation (2021)) to identify the evolution and sustainability of community responses (including resource use) and any treatment effect. Analyses of intention-to-treat and as-per-protocol (ie, reaching component 3) treatment effects will be undertaken. Costs and benefits will be modelled over the rest of life, until the study cohort of children has either died or reached 100 years of age. The dollar value of community resources harnessed for $1 investment into component 1 will also be estimated. All costs will be inflated to current Australian dollars for the year of study completion using the all-items Consumer Price Index from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. All costs and benefits will be converted to present values using an annual discount rate of 5% in the base case, and annual rates of 3.5% and 0% in sensitivity analysis.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
</p>
                <p>Two perspectives will be taken. First, a funder/organiser perspective will be adopted, where the relevant intervention costs pertain to components 1 and 2. This perspective is broadly equivalent to what Frew<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> describes as a ‘local authorities’ perspective, where a community’s leaders in local government, health services and primary schools (each having remit over health and well-being of children in their communities), will (collectively) be most likely responsible for sourcing funds to facilitate the first component of a WHO STOPS style strategy beyond the trial setting, as well as providing resources for the backbone role (component 2). As such, this perspective will have most utility for local decision-makers. Depending on the funding source of the identified backbone organisations, it is possible that this funder/organiser perspective will overlap significantly with a state government perspective. Second, a societal perspective will be taken, which will include the costs of resources contributed by the broader community through component 3, as well as future health system cost offsets. While it is expected that community actions will largely be resourced by reallocations of existing resources and funds, the associated opportunity costs require identification. This perspective will be of value for funding decision-making at higher levels (eg, state, national) where broader comparisons of relative cost-effectiveness within and across health silos are made, as well as for communities considering such a strategy, so they are fully aware that any treatment effect observed in this trial may have been mediated by the scale of community resources (eg, volunteer hours) contributed in those communities.</p>
                <p>Given the burden associated with costing, the costing of components 2 and 3 will be restricted to two intervention communities and two control communities. These will be selected by the research team in consultation with external partners using the following considerations: (1) there is comparability in the population size of intervention and control communities, (2) the selected communities have some generalisability from the perspective of decision-makers, and (3) the backbone organisation agrees to participate in data provision and collection for the economic evaluation. To capture broader, less quantifiable issues that are of concern to policy-makers, WHO STOPS will also be assessed against other implementation considerations (strength of evidence, equity, acceptability to stakeholders, sustainability, feasibility of implementation and potential side effects) as per the approach developed and employed by Carter <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> These will be assessed by the research team in consultation with backbone organisations and other community partners.</p>

              <p>Should an action result in an organisation moving funds between obesity-related programmes (ie, no net change in obesity-related programme funding), the costs associated with the newly funded activity will not be included in the cost-effectiveness analysis, though the new activity will be identified and documented. Given the intractability of such data — any changes in household expenditure on food and PA, and changes in revenue flowing to local retailers as a result of component 3 actions will be excluded. The costs of designing and developing the process for engaging and facilitating community actions (component 1), and Systems Thinking in Community Knowledge Exchange software will be excluded as they largely pre-exist this trial and will have wider use beyond this childhood obesity prevention intervention.</p>
              <p>To assess the extent to which an identified action is attributable to WHO STOPS, at least two backbone team members (or relevant key informants) will respond to the following questions for each identified action: (1) Was the action commenced after Component 3 was implemented? (2) Is there a known link between WHO STOPS and the action? (3) Were any participants in planning or implementing the given action also involved in any WHO STOPs GMB sessions? (4) Was the implemented action intended to directly or indirectly address childhood obesity? (5) What proportion of the target population were children? (6) Were new resources allocated to obesity-related actions? (7) To what extent do you think the WHO STOPS intervention motivated implementation of the given action—(select one response: not at all, a little, somewhat, a lot, completely).</p>
              <p>Given the intrinsic variability of component 3 of the intervention, it is possible that comprehensive costing of only two of the five communities might not provide an accurate representation of the potentially large between-community heterogeneity of actions and costs involved in this component. As a way to investigate this variability, all communities will be encouraged to monitor community actions and resource contributions using the community action register. Prior to finishing the economic evaluation, results from the costing of the two selected intervention communities will be discussed with backbone organisations from all intervention communities. Those backbone organisations from communities not comprehensively costed will be asked to consider those results alongside the actions registered in their own registers, and reflect on the extent to which findings appear consistent with their own communities. If perceived heterogeneity is raised, this will be acknowledged as a limitation in the published economic evaluation results.</p>
              <p>The collection of resource use data relating to current practice in the control communities will differ in some respects. Backbone organisations will not be actively established by the research team until close to step 2 implementation. This will minimise researcher-led contamination of the control communities, but will result in a reliance on retrospective identification of community actions in those communities (as set out in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) and raises the risk of failing to identify ‘current practice’ actions that occurred. This potential for recall bias reinforces the importance of taking steps to assess attribution of actions to WHO STOPS in the intervention communities.</p>

              <title>Valuation of resource use</title>
              <p>The time contributions of individuals (professional and volunteer time) will be costed using opportunity cost principles. Resource use of non-health sector goods and services will be valued at market prices and be informed by best available evidence from Australian-based studies. Where relevant, health resources will be costed as per the Manual of Resource Items for use in submissions to the Commonwealth of Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
</p>
              <p>Where the data collection strategy results in insufficient detail for an identified community action, evidence of costs may be drawn from comparable community-based obesity prevention activities. The anticipated large number of community-led actions likely to be identified and logged in a backbone’s action register will deem it infeasible to collect detailed data on resource use for each registered action. As such, each action will be classified into small, medium and large (in terms of resource intensity) by backbone organisation personnel. A sample from each classification will then be costed in detail, with results extrapolated.</p>

              <title>Uncertainty and scenario analyses</title>
              <p>It is important to note some of the challenges being faced that may have implications for the estimated treatment effect. The intervention aims to make system-level changes, some of which will take longer than the trial period to occur. Further, due to the variability we have observed in the time it takes communities to reach the component 3 stage (community actions), it is likely there will be variable effects measured across communities after 2 years. The 4-year analyses to be undertaken will be comparing a maximum of 4 years of exposure (step 1 communities) versus a maximum 2 years of exposure (step 2 communities) rather than comparing against a current practice control. However, BMI change data are being collected from a small number of schools in 13 communities external to the WHO STOPS study.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The methods of data collection and general characteristics of the surveyed schools differ from the current study. So, while these external communities do not constitute the ideal control group, several of the external communities are comparable (in terms of population and geographic proximity to major urban centres). These external communities will provide an indication of BMI trends in non-WHO STOPS settings. This will facilitate the estimation of plausible variations in treatment effects at 2 and 4 years for use in sensitivity analyses.</p>
              <p>It is possible that other family members of targeted children and the broader community may also benefit from the WHO STOPS intervention in terms of BMI change.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Furthermore, the intervention may result in (1) productivity gains (given potentially reduced child absenteeism from school for obesity-related reasons leading to lower parent absenteeism from work), and (2) improved future income levels arising from improved schooling outcomes.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> Best available evidence on such broader potential costs and benefits will be sought and included in scenario analyses.</p>
              <p>Given uncertainty around the maintenance of community responses and treatment effects beyond the trial period, modelling of future benefits and health cost savings will test a range of plausible assumptions of decayed and maintained treatment effect. These may range from full decay over 5 or 10 years through to 100% maintenance of effect. In the event that within trial analyses of the proxy indicators of system change suggest an accentuation of treatment effect is plausible, modest accentuation of treatment effect will also be modelled.</p>
              <p>Extensive analyses will be undertaken to test the sensitivity of results to plausible variations in all trial-based and modelled variables, including assumptions around the maintenance of any observed changes in BMI (as discussed above), PA and fruit and vegetable consumption as well the costs of alternative approaches to GMB facilitation (where local community members are trained to facilitate). Further, in the event that BMI changes are observed in children, the potential impact on the intervention’s cost-effectiveness of broader ‘family effects’ will be investigated in scenario analyses. The potential for system dynamics models to estimate the impact of ‘system-wide’ changes on future obesity-related behaviours and prevalence will be explored and considered for use in scenario analyses.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Obesity is associated with poorer health and quality of life—its prevalence is high and rising in many countries.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Childhood obesity can have detrimental health and well-being implications during childhood and is a major predictor of obesity in adulthood and its serious and expensive associated conditions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Community-based strategies have been effective in achieving some reductions in population BMI, but these have not been sustained. The WHO STOPS intervention builds on this evidence base. It seeks to harness existing community resources and expand the extent of local engagement in obesity-risk reduction, across whole communities.</p>
              <p>Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of this novel systems-based intervention will help policy-makers by assessing the resource use implications of achieving any observed intervention effect. This protocol considers the main challenges posed by the economic evaluation of such a complex intervention designed to produce systems change. This protocol registers our intent to conduct this evaluation alongside the WHO STOPS Childhood Obesity Trial, and describes for transparency, the predetermined approaches for addressing the methodological challenges described and the analyses planned a priori. This does not preclude additional hurdles arising during the course of the project forcing additions to or deviations from this plan, but these will be openly documented during the reporting of results.</p>
