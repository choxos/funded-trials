                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The intraoperative administration of dexamethasone for prophylaxis against postoperative nausea and vomiting is a common and recommended practice. The safety of the administration of this immunosuppressive agent at a time of significant immunological disruption has not been rigorously evaluated in terms of infective complications.</p>

                  <title>Methods/analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial. A total of 8880 patients undergoing elective major surgery will be enrolled. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either dexamethasone 8‚Äâmg or placebo intravenously following the induction of anaesthesia in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by centre and diabetes status. Patient enrolment into the trial is ongoing. The primary outcome is surgical site infection at 30 days following surgery, defined according to the Centre for Disease Control criteria.</p>

                  <title>Ethics/dissemination</title>
                  <p>The PADDI trial has been approved by the ethics committees of over 45 participating sites in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Africa and the Netherlands. The trial has been endorsed by the Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists Clinical Trials Network and the Australian Society for Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network. Participant recruitment began in March 2016 and is expected to be complete in mid-2019. Publication of the results of the PADDI trial is anticipated to occur in early 2020.</p>

                <title>Dexamethasone administration in surgical patients</title>
                <p>Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid with potent anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects. It is frequently administered in the perioperative period, most commonly for prophylaxis and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> PONV is a major problem in perioperative care occurring in 25%‚Äì30% of all surgical patients, and up to 70%‚Äì80% in high-risk populations (eg, tonsillectomy, strabismus and laparoscopic surgery) without prophylaxis,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> and it adversely affects patient satisfaction with care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The antiemetic mechanisms of dexamethasone are unknown but may include anti-inflammatory actions in the gastrointestinal tract, inhibition of brainstem enkephalin release and modification of central prostaglandin and serotonin synthesis.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The number-needed-to-treat for prophylaxis is approximately four.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> International guidelines recommend a prophylactic intravenous (IV) dose of 4 to 5‚Äâmg for adults, but 8‚Äâmg is recommended as having additional analgesic benefits.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In a survey of a selection of fellows of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) we found that at least 60% of all respondents routinely administer dexamethasone, principally as an antiemetic, to most non-cardiac surgical patients.

                <title>The safety of perioperative dexamethasone administration</title>
                <p>Although glucocorticoid use in cardiac surgery has been shown to be both beneficial and safe,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> comparable large randomised controlled trials in non-cardiac surgical patients are lacking. A retrospective case‚Äìcontrol study suggested that dexamethasone increases infection risk<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> while a retrospective cohort study did not confirm these findings.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Two small randomised trials also failed to demonstrate an association between dexamethasone use and infection.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> One was prematurely terminated and both were underpowered.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> A recent large trial of the antiemetic effectiveness of dexamethasone 8‚Äâmg in 1350 patients undergoing colorectal surgery confirmed the antiemetic effect of dexamethasone but infective outcomes were not specifically interrogated.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Significant concern has been expressed regarding the safety of the administration of dexamethasone in the perioperative period in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39‚Äì41</xref> Although meta-analyses have asserted the safety of perioperative glucocorticoids, even in very large doses,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 16 42 43</xref> the clinical trials to date are antiemetic efficacy studies. Few have examined the long-term side effects or eventual patient outcomes and none of these studies were adequately powered for infection. The subsequent meta-analyses therefore give an unwarranted impression of the safety profile of perioperative dexamethasone. We reached a comparable conclusion to others, which is that there was no signal of harm, but that current trials were too small, underpowered and did not include important safety endpoints (such as wound infection) as a primary endpoint.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44 45</xref> We have therefore designed a trial to address this question.</p>

                <title>Why a non-inferiority trial?</title>
                <p>Noninferiority trials are increasingly used to evaluate whether effective treatments are safe.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> We chose to employ this study design, despite an increase in the complexity associated with statistical analysis and a larger sample size than would be required for a conventional superiority or equivalence trial. The justification for the design is that antiemetic effectiveness, which is the principal indication of the use of intraoperative dexamethasone, has already been demonstrated. We chose an absolute non-inferiority margin (‚ñ≥) of 2% which was agreed by the steering committee using the Delphi method, as the literature is clearly inconsistent. An absolute increase in risk of infection of 2% produces a number needed to harm (NNH) of 50. This was considered the maximum acceptable absolute increase in infection risk that could be tolerated to conclude non-inferiority.</p>

                <p>Diagrammatic representation of participant flow through the trial processes are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. Patients are asked to complete the 12-item version of the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) preoperatively. All patients receive prophylactic antibiotics according to established guidelines. Patients in the diabetes stratum have a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) value measured prior to surgery. Perioperative care for diabetes patients, including management of perioperative diabetes medications and perioperative blood glucose measurements are delivered according to local protocols. Upon the insertion of a cannula, all patients have a point-of-care (POC) blood glucose value measured. A POC blood glucose measurement is also performed on arrival to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 8 to 12‚Äâhours following study drug administration (irrespective of whether this is an intraoperative or postoperative sample). These values will be fasting samples. On day one postoperatively, all patients have a POC blood glucose value determined. The protocol does not stipulate that the day one POC blood glucose values have to be measures in the fasted state. The protocol also does not stipulate whether the POC values will be measured on arterial, venous or capillary blood, nor does it stipulate which devices are to be used. In this very large trial, we expect that the law of numbers will produce balance of these measures among the groups. Hence, these values will all be recorded and included in the tertiary analysis. On day two postoperatively, all patients still hospitalised have a C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration measured. Additional laboratory tests are ordered as dictated by clinical need and local practice.</p>

                <p>The study drug phial (2 mL) is supplied to the attending anaesthetist, and is administered as an intravenous bolus within 5‚Äâmin after the induction of anaesthesia. Choice of anaesthetic agents, antiemetics and perioperative analgesia are left to the discretion of the anaesthetist and is recorded. Patients are followed daily and outcomes are recorded until discharge. On day one all patients are asked to complete the 15-item quality of recovery score (QoR-15).<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> In the PACU and on days one to three, pain and nausea severity are assessed using numerical rating scales. The number of vomiting episodes and use of antiemetic agents is also recorded. A wound assessment questionnaire is completed on day three and on the day of discharge. Safety data are collected throughout the entire study period and at 30 days. Thirty days after surgery, all patients are contacted by phone to ascertain whether they have experienced any outcomes, and if detected, further testing is arranged. Documentation for such events is sought in the hospital medical record and doctor‚Äôs records. The QoR-15 is repeated on day 30 along with WHODAS V.2.0, and the WHODAS V.2.0 is repeated 6 months after surgery to ascertain survival status and new-onset disability. At 6 months, patients are asked whether there is pain in the surgical site. If the answer is affirmative, they are asked to complete a modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (mBPI-SF) and Neuropathic Pain Questionnaires. Additional dexamethasone (or other glucocorticoid) is prohibited for the 30-day study period following surgery.</p>

Study data are collected in a paper-based case report form, for transcription onto a web database. Random audits of centres are performed throughout the conduct of the trial, aiming to assess the accuracy and legitimacy of the trial data, and to confirm compliance with Good Clinical Practice. All study personnel have 24‚Äâhours access to the study coordinating centre to resolve any questions that arise. All data will be stored on an independent server and regularly backed up to at least one other source. The steering committee will have access to all trial data sets and all requests for post-trial data release will require consideration and authorisation by the committee.</p>

                <p>Interim analyses for assessment of non-inferiority and harm of the primary outcome will be performed after enrolment of 2960 and 5920 patients (1/3 and 2/3 of total recruitment) using two-sided repeated asymmetric CIs. The primary analysis will use the mITT population defined above. Asymmetrical stopping boundaries will be used, as the clinical significance of a signal indicating harm is felt to be more important than the lack of harm. Non-inferiority will be declared at a particular time point if the upper endpoint of the CI for the difference in infection rates (dexamethasone minus placebo) is less than 2%. Harm will be declared if the lower endpoint of the CI lies above 2%. The upper endpoint of the CI for consideration of non-inferiority will be based on the O‚ÄôBrien-Fleming spending function. The lower endpoint of the CI for consideration of harm will be based on the less conservative Power function with parameter 2. CI at any time point is then defined as (estimate‚ÄìZ<sub>LOWER</sub> SE, estimate+Z<sub>UPPER</sub>‚ÄâSE). At (information) fractions of 33%, 67% and 100% of patients, the upper Z values for non-inferiority are 3.71, 2.51 and 1.99, respectively, and the lower Z values for harm are 2.77, 2.35 and 2.06.</p>
                <p>The analysis of the primary endpoint will be repeated for the PP population and the AT population, using the same boundaries as for the mITT population. The boundaries will be adjusted according to the actual number of patients randomised at the time of each interim analysis. Should the result cross a designated boundary at an interim analysis, consideration will be given by the DSMC to terminate the trial <underline>if</underline> the committee believes the interim results are sufficiently compelling to change practice around the world</p>

The trial has been approved by the ethics committees of over 45 participating sites in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Africa and the Netherlands.Final results are expected to be presented at one or more international scientific meetings in 2020 and 2021. The main results of the trial are expected to be published in a major medical journal in 2020. There are no plans to provide public access to the participant-level database. The trial has been endorsed by the Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists Clinical Trials Network, and the Australian Society for Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network, and it has received a project grant from the National Medical Health and Research Council of Australia.</p>
