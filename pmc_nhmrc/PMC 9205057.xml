                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Older companion dogs naturally develop a dementia-like syndrome with biological, clinical and therapeutic similarities to Alzheimer disease (AD). Given there has been no new safe, clinically effective and widely accessible treatment for AD for almost 20 years, an all-new cell therapeutic approach was trialled in canine veterinary patients, and further modelled in aged rats for more detailed neurobiological analysis.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A Phase 1/2A veterinary trial was conducted in <italic>N</italic> = 6 older companion dogs with definitive diagnosis of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD). Treatment comprised direct microinjection of 250,000 autologous skin-derived neuroprecursors (SKNs) into the bilateral hippocampus using MRI-guided stereotaxis. Safety was assessed clinically and efficacy using the validated Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Rating Scale (CCDR) at baseline and 3-month post treatment. Intention to treat analysis imputed a single patient that had a surgical adverse event requiring euthanasia. Three dog brains were donated following natural death and histology carried out to quantify Alzheimer pathology as well as immature neurons and synapses; these were compared to a brain bank (<italic>N</italic> = 12) of untreated aged dogs with and without CCD. Further, an age-related memory dysfunction rat model (<italic>N</italic> = 16) was used to more closely evaluate intrahippocampal engraftment of canine SKN cells, focusing on mnemonic and synaptic effects as well as donor cell survival, neurodifferentation and electrophysiologic circuit integration in a live hippocampal slice preparation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Four out-of-five dogs improved on the primary clinical CCDR endpoint, three fell below diagnostic threshold, and remarkably, two underwent full syndromal reversal lasting up to 2 years. At post mortem, synaptic density in the hippocampus specifically was nine standard deviations above non-treated dogs, and intensity of new neurons also several fold higher. There was no impact on AD pathology or long-term safety signals. Modelling in aged rats replicated the main canine trial findings: hippocampally-dependent place memory deficits were reversed and synaptic depletion rescued. In addition, this model confirmed donor cell survival and migration throughout the hippocampus, neuronal differentiation in situ<italic>,</italic> and physiologically-correct integration into pyramidal layer circuits.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">With further development, SKN cell therapy may have potential for treating carefully chosen AD patients based on neurosynaptic restoration in the hippocampus.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Dementia is a devastating clinical syndrome that typically begins with amnesia and progresses to cognitive, behavioural and neuropsychiatric impairment, and in final stages, dysphagia and incontinence. Worldwide, 48 million people are affected, with advanced age the strongest risk factor followed by APOE4 genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The proximate biological cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related dementia is a mass loss of neurons and synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], initially in the medial temporal lobe and ultimately severe enough to destroy network function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Multiple upstream pathologies are implicated beyond the classic AD hallmarks of extracellular amyloid plaques and intra-neuronal tauopathic inclusions, these commonly co-occurring alongside other neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Despite recent FDA approval of the first disease-modifying drug for AD (aducanumab) there has been no new clinically effective and widely accessible dementia treatment since 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and so innovative therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Cell therapy aims to restore and regenerate neurons and synapses by donor cellular integration into functional circuits and paracrine mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and more recently by application of extracellular vesicles such as cell-derived exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Rodent studies have provided proof-of-concept using different cell types and models (reviewed by Duncan &amp; Valenzuela [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]), and a single Phase I clinical trial of direct brain injection of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) found the procedure was safe but of no therapeutic consequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Several issues have limited clinical development. Induced pluripotential stem (IPS) cell technologies lack manufacture control in terms of genomic instability and variability between clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]<sub>,</sub> donor-related lineage bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and low donor success rates. MSCs do not survive in the mammalian brain for more than a few weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and glial differentiation is common in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. More generally, progress has been impeded by lack of a clinically predictive and biologically relevant large-animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">In response, we developed a suite of technologies for diagnosing and treating Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD) that naturally displays many of the same clinical signs as human AD dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Prevalence of CCD rises exponentially with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and CCD is associated with brain atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], beta-amyloid pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], hyperphosphorylated tau pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] distributed in the human Braak-like pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and loss of midbrain neurons that innervate the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Notably, CCD occurs spontaneously on a diverse genetic background and dogs are universally homozygous for AD risk gene APOE4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For these reasons, there is increasing interest in CCD as a large-animal translational model of AD that exhibits a dementia-like syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">At the same time, we developed a new process for the culture of unipotent canine <italic>skin-derived neural precursors</italic> (SKNs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. SKNs are defined by a CD271<sup>+</sup>Nestin<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup> phenotype and for a number of reasons are attractive for cell therapy. These cells are free of genetic modification and in a detailed characterization study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] we have shown: SKNs do not express pluripotential markers; can undergo reliable and uniform manufacture from a small sample of donor skin; are capable of in vitro differentiation into functional neurons; and do not express glial protein or genes.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Here, we therefore report on the first veterinary trial of SKN cell therapy for the treatment of CCD. Treatment comprised a dose of 250,000 autologous SKN cells microinjected stereotaxically into both hippocampi using patient-specific MRI-based co-ordinates. In order to address some open questions from the trial, we further modelled the therapeutic process in aged rodents with hippocampally selective memory and synaptic dyfunction.</p>

                  <p id="Par11">This trial was approved by the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee, and because it spanned 8 years (2012–2020) the trial encompassed several protocol updates. These protocol changes are summarised in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplementary Materials and full versions of the therapeutic protocols are also included to aid in replication.</p>
                  <p id="Par12">The experimental model was Canine Cognitive Dysfunction, diagnosed in aged companion dogs (<italic>N</italic> = 6, 2 female, 4 male, aged 10–16 years see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table ST1) in the following manner: First, a provisional CCD diagnosis was provided by an initial CCDR score &gt;  = 50 that requires evidence of both neurobehavioural dysfunction and a history of decline over the last 6-months. CCDR-based diagnoses has been validated against clinical diagnosis of canine dementia with an accuracy of &gt; 98% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], overall item reliability was high (Chronbach’s alpha = 0.86), and test–retest reliability established with an intraclass coefficient of <italic>r</italic> = 0.73 and absolute difference between iterations of 0.2 points (SD 2.3), translating to a Reliable Change Index of ± 5-points. Improvement on the CCDR by more than 5 points was therefore used to classify therapeutic responders.</p>
                  <p id="Par13">Next, a definitive diagnosis of CCD was made after exclusion of potential biological causes of abnormal canine behaviour apart from AD, such as concurrent illness, systemic infection, pain, intracranial mass, renal failure, polypharmacy (and some specific medications), diabetes or endocrine disorder, and confirmed by a consultant veterinary neurologist.</p>
                  <p id="Par14">The primary endpoint of the trial was the standard published CCDR at baseline and a modified CCDR at follow-ups, where change-over-time items were compared to “before treatment” as opposed to “6-months ago” as in the standard CCDR.</p>

                  <title>General overview</title>
                  <p id="Par19">Clinical trial patients were sourced either through referral from veterinary clinics in the Greater Sydney region, through an online CCDR Register or through direct online owner enquiry to the Regenerative Neuroscience Group, the University of Sydney. All participants in the clinical trial were privately owned pets, and all owners/carers provided informed consent.</p>
                  <p id="Par20">Dogs were required to satisfy selection criteria to be eligible for trial enrolment: aged 8 years or older and score ≥ 50 on the CCDR scale; must not suffer from severe separation anxiety; must have a normal blood panel (including T4) and a normal urine panel; must have a reasonable level of mobility, a reasonable level of vision and a body condition score ≤ 4; must not be on high dose oral corticosteroids and must pass a veterinary ‘fitness for trial’ checklist. Dogs must not suffer from any behavioural, medical or neurological condition which may present with similar clinical signs to CCD.</p>
                  <p id="Par21">Over the course of weeks 0–2, baseline physical activity was recorded using a wearable device, attached to the dog’s collar. Baseline activity was recorded for one week. The dog continued to wear the device throughout its involvement in the trial. During this period, patients underwent neurological assessment by a veterinary neurologist to provide confirmation of the provisional CCD diagnosis.</p>
                  <p id="Par22">During weeks 2–4, the patient underwent three procedures under a single general anaesthetic, referred to as the “first procedure”: skin biopsy, MR imaging of the brain and the implantation of fixed fiduciary screws into the skull. The skin sample was transferred to the RNG lab and processed for the production of autologous SKNs (see Methods below). MRI was acquired to produce patient-specific stereotaxic targets for cell delivery into the hippocampus (see Methods below) as well as exclude structural brain abnormalities that may contribute to behavioural change unrelated to Alzheimer’s (e.g. cranial neoplasm, adenoma). Fixed screws were implanted to aid in skull/brain co-registration between MRI images and head position on the stereotaxic frame during surgery (see Methods below).</p>
                  <p id="Par23">Two weeks prior to cell transplant, and for 4 weeks after transplant, the owner was instructed to double their dog’s level of exercise. The dog’s activity level was monitored during this time using a wearable device.</p>
                  <p id="Par24">Skin sutures were removed 10–14 days following skin biopsy and screw placement. At this time, the dog’s primary carer repeated the CCDR. This score was considered to be the pre-therapeutic reference baseline score. At this time point, the dogs’ spatial memory was assessed in the Canine Sand Maze.</p>
                  <p id="Par25">Approximately 4–5 weeks post the first procedure, during which the SKN cells were manufactured, each patient underwent hippocampal microinjection of their autologous skin-derived neural precursor cells (SKNs) under general anaesthesia (“second procedure”). In preparation for cell transplant, the patient was administered oral levetiracetam for 48 h pre-operatively to reduce the risk of post-operative seizure activity. Post operatively, patients remained under the care of the veterinary specialist team until suitable for discharge and levetiracetam was continued for one week.</p>
                  <p id="Par26">Follow-up veterinary assessments were carried out at 1-month, 3-months (CCDR change primary endpoint) and 6-month post-operative time points, and then annually for life. Repeat spatial memory assessment was repeated in the Canine Sand Maze at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups.</p>
                  <p id="Par27">With the owner’s permission, the participant’s brain was donated at the time of elective euthanasia to the research group’s Canine Brain Bank for histological analysis of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, synaptic markers and assessment of anomalous cell growth.</p>

The was then dissociated by mechanical maceration and passed through a 40 µm cell strainer (BD Bioscience, Sydney, NSW, Australia). The resultant cell suspension was centrifuged at 180G for 5 min. The cell pellet was re-suspended in serum free growth medium consisting of 3:1 DMEM/F12 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific Australia Pty Ltd, Scorseby, VIC, Australia), 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Australia Pty Ltd, Scorseby, VIC, Australia), 20 ng/mL EGF (BD Bioscience, Sydney, NSW, Australia), 40 ng/mL bFGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific Australia Pty Ltd, Scorseby, VIC, Australia), and 2% B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Australia Pty Ltd, Scorseby, VIC, Australia). The cells were then seeded into non-tissue culture treated dishes at a density of 100,000 cells/cm and incubated at 37 °C. After 5 days, when the resulting neurospheres have reached ~ 50 µm in diameter, they were removed from the media by centrifugation and dissociated in TrypLE Select (Thermo Fisher Scientific Australia Pty Ltd, Scorseby, VIC, Australia) at 37 °C for 5 min followed by agitation of the suspension by manual pipetting. The resulting single cells were re-suspended in serum free growth medium, seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/cm on 0.1% gelatin coated flasks, and passaged weekly or when at 80% confluency, for 3 weeks.</p>
                <p id="Par30">In preparation for transplantation, cells were enzymatically released from the culture surface using TrypLE Select at 37 °C for 5 min.

                <title>Brain imaging</title>
                <p id="Par31">All MRI brain imaging (except Sasha) was conducted on the Animal Referral Hospital’s Siemens Magneton Avanto 1.5 Tesla system. Sasha’s MRI was acquired at University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Sydney using a Esaote Vet Grande 0.25 Tesla System. As both systems are clinical scanners, image acquisition protocols varied over time and image quality was impacted by hardware and software changes. However, for the purpose of stereotaxic hippocampal targeting, these changes were not relevant.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Before acquisition of the 3D T1 weighted MR image, a series of scout scans are performed to ensure the alignment of the head within the scanner. Dogs are scanned in sternal recumbency with the head extended. The coronal, sagittal and transverse planes are set in the MRI System software, but several scout scans are performed to ensure the head is aligned in the following way: that the ventral aspect of the tympanic bullae are horizontal (X-axis); that the line transecting the external sagittal crest and the midline of the brain between the two cerebral hemispheres is vertical (Z-axis), and that the line transects the insertion site of the two titanium screws at the level of the skull surface is horizontal (Y-axis).</p>

                <title>Neurosurgery and patient-specific stereotaxis</title>
                <p id="Par37">Hippocampal targeting was challenging in a veterinary hospital setting because of a tolerance of ± 2 mm in xyz directions, and the absence of a frameless stereotaxic system as often used in human neurosurgery.</p>
                <p id="Par38">We therefore first developed and validated a procedure on canine and sheep cadavers that achieved hippocampal targeting verified by injection of dye and immediate PM inspection of the hippocampus. This protocol involved implantation of two fixed fiduciary markers onto the canine skull in the form of small 2 mm titanium screws. Two screws were implanted into the skull longitudinally along the midline: one anteriorly at the symphysis of the temporal line and sagittal crest, and the second 20 mm posteriorly also along the sagittal crest.</p>
                <p id="Par39">The purpose of these fiduciary markers was to allow co-registration between the 3D brain images captured by MRI, and the skull and brain whilst within the stereotaxic apparatus (KOPF, Model 1530 frame using Model 1460 XYZ Electrode manipulator and Model 1772 Universal Holder) on the surgical table. MRI images were rotated by rigid-body transformation such that the two screws (visible as image artefacts) were in the horizontal plane to control pitch rotation, in-line antero-posteriorly when viewed axially (using human brain imaging conventions) to control yaw rotation, and the auditory canals in the horizontal plane on coronal slice to control roll rotation. Hippocampal targets were then calculated as XYZ displacements from the middle of the posterior screw.</p>
                <p id="Par40">These ideal target conditions were replicated on the surgical table by using the needle tip attached to the stereotaxic frame to ensure the two screws were positioned horizontal and longitudinally in alignment, and by the ear bars fitting into the same peri-auricular fossa (or submandibular fossa depending on size of skull). Hippocampal targets were subsequently achieved by reference to the 0,0,0 point being the middle of the posterior screwhead.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Sasha, Timmy, Leo and Gracie underwent this stereotaxic protocol (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: neurosurgical procedures). Because of difficulties in achieving the desired skull position in Gracie (the largest dog physically), we improved the process by allowing for measurement of deviation from the idealized skull position, using the needle tip to measure xyz offsets. These offset measurements were imported into a calculator in real time such that revised hippocampal XYZ targets were used that accounted for the <italic>achieved</italic> dog head position on the surgical table. Grover was treated using this method.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Finally, a major refinement was carried out for Gus whereby surgery was moved to the Sydney University Hybrid Theatre, which allows for co-registration between the patient’s CT and MRI, and then real time interactive CT imaging on the surgical table, allowing the surgeon to visualise the needle in the brain and progressing the needle tip to the hippocampal target.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Neurosurgery proceeded by positioning the anaesthetised and intubated dog onto the stereotaxic frame, preparing the surgical field, and exposing the skull by longitudinal incision of the overlying soft tissues and retraction of masseter muscle fibres. Two burr holes (approximately 3 mm wide) were drilled bilaterally using a neurosurgical drill. A 25G needle (Hamilton syringe) loaded with therapeutic dose (250,000 SKN cells in 20 µL) was then lowered using the stereotaxic apparatus through the burr hole and into the brain to the pre-determined z-plane to deliver cells to the dorsal hippocampus. Cells were discharged over 3 min and the needle left in place another 3-min to allow cell diffusion. This procedure was carried out for both left and right hippocampi. Previously inserted titanium screws were removed.</p>

Briefly, the dog is familiarised with the sand arena (6 m radius with 4 large orientating signs) and then must show food-driven motivation, assessed by voluntarily walking towards and eating a sign-posted food treat. Then the dog enters the learning trial phase of 8 trials (instead of 2 × 8 = 16 trials as originally designed because of fatigue in our older dogs): these comprise a signposted food treat trial in a specific arena location alternating with an unflagged trial where the treat is hidden in the same location below the sand. On each trial the dog enters the arena from a new door. The four unflagged trials comprise the four learning trials. The dog then leaves the arena and room for 90 min to rest, and returns for a single 90-s probe trial to determine whether the dog navigates to the learnt spatial location where there is no longer a food treat (to control for potential olfactory-based navigation a dummy or foil food reward is buried one-quarter arena rotation away). Time to reward quadrant, reward zone and action (digging up food) is captured by video and analysed automatically using customised TrackMate Pro (TrackMate, Australia) software. CSM was performed prior to treatment and then at the 3-month and 6-month follow up timepoints.</p>

We carried out sensitivity analysis on the full ITT sample by imputation of the single excluded patient by the Last Observation Carried Forward method. For individual level analyses, we carried out T-test comparisons between before and after data.</p>

                <title>Objective behavioural measures</title>
                <p id="Par86">An open-label design was used in this veterinary trial for the same reason it is commonly employed in first-in-human cell therapy trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]: CCD is a progressive and terminal disorder and surgical delivery encompasses some risk; it was considered ethically inappropriate to employ an inert control arm. To guard against expectancy bias, we developed and implemented a series of exploratory objective behavioural measures during the 8-year course of the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par87">Initially, we used the Canine Sand Maze (CSM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], an appetitive, dry-land spatial learning and memory test modelled on the standard Morris Water Maze used in rodents. In Leo, we found significant within-animal improvement between pre- and post- treatment tests (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S10), including on the final learning trial (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C), whilst for Timmy there was also better final learning trial performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D) but this was non-significant across trials (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11).</p>
                <p id="Par88">A limitation of the CSM was lack of practical administration on all animals, and so we changed to use of wearable devices to capture high-fidelity data in a naturalistic and non-intrusive manner. Function Cloud was developed and validated for mapping movement around the home. For Grover, this was sensitive to his main clinical sign, repetitive circling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E), and verified the CCDR report of improved wandering (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). This pattern of reduced in-home wandering was replicated in Gus (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S12, S13) and in addition, a commercial device (Fitbark™, USA) was used to measure playful physical activity outside the home; this also verified Gus’ main area of clinical improvement on the CCDR (increased activity level) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G). Whilst these wearable technologies were supportive of the primary clinical endpoint, their progressive implementation during the trial was a limitation because a complete dataset was not available for each treated veterinary patient.</p>

This was accompanied by a high degree of donor cell survival at 10-weeks (27% based on canine-specific lamin <italic>marker</italic>; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S15–17 for control studies), cells migrating throughout the hippocampus and maximal engraftment seen in the CA1 subfield (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S19). A high proportion of donor cells differentiated into neurons (73% co-expressed neuronal <italic>βIII tubulin</italic>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F) and, in an extension study with GFP-labelled donor cells (<italic>n</italic> = 2), co-expression of mature neuronal markers <italic>NeuN</italic> and <italic>Neurofilament</italic> was ubiquitous (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S20).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par98">Altogether, these findings signal an initial step towards an all new therapeutic approach to AD. To date, there has been no attempt to restore the lost neurons and synapses that is the biological basis of Alzheimer dementia symptoms. Congruent findings of neuronal and synaptic restoration, and cognitive recovery, in dogs and rodents suggest such an approach is rational and the basis for further research.</p>
              <p id="Par99">Caution is however required because of the noted limitations in the canine study. This was a small, open-label, non-controlled veterinary trial and secondary outcomes using objective behavioural measures, whilst convergent, were not collected using the same technology across all animals. In addition, we found only indicative evidence of neurorestoration in those canine patients who came to <italic>post mortem,</italic> in the form of strikingly higher numbers of new hippocampal neurons and synapses, because a definitive donor cell marker was not available. This was addressed by modelling of the therapeutic process, using the same canine SKNs in aged rodents that develop similar synaptic and mnemonic deficits, but do not develop AD pathology. As in the canine trial, we found profound increases in synaptic density, normalization of impaired hippocampal-dependent memory, and importantly, high levels of donor cell survival, in situ neurodifferentiation, adoption of correct CA1 anatomy, and hippocamapal circuit integration. The positive clinical and neurobiological results of the canine trial are therefore consistent with observations from a xenograft rodent model using the same donor cells.</p>
              <p id="Par100">Our results add to prior studies of cell-based treatment of AD in rodent models. MSCs transplants in AD mice models have generally found no cell survival beyond 4–6 weeks, and a complex pattern of paracrine mechanisms converging on modulation of inflammation and microglial responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. By contrast, hippocampal injection of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> human IPS cells induced down a neuronal lineage found donor cells persisted for at least 45 days, differentiated into cholinergic and GABAergic phenotypes, and improved spatial memory deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, our study is the first to trial an autologous cell therapy in a large-animal model of AD with a dementia-like syndrome, a model with clinical, pathological, neuroanatomical and genetic similarities to the human condition. Given dogs can also predict human pharmacological response to new AD drugs, whilst rodents can not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and we found persistence of neuroregenerative and clinical improvements for up to 2-years post treatment, there is more confidence about potential for treating human AD than on the basis of rodent data alone. That said, CCD is best considered a model of a <italic>mild</italic> AD dementia-like syndrome because phosphorylated tauopathy rarely expresses the human late-stage neurofibrillary tangle marker (AT8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and hippocampal atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] does not appear to be due to neuronal loss above and beyond advanced age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par101">Human trial will therefore need to carefully select correspondent early stage AD patients. Starting dose will also need careful consideration, because in this veterinary trial we did not compare different therapeutic doses. Given SKN cell therapy also had no observable impact on upstream AD pathology, the net clinical effect may therefore be to ‘buy time’; a period during which cognitive circuits can resume operation and support higher-order function. In some of our canine patients this amounted to years of regained quality of life, of major personal significance to our dogs’ carers and of major clinical significance if translated to humans.</p>

In 2018, MV, TD and Dr An Truong invented new technology for manufacturing SKN-like cells from mature adult human skin; Skin2Neuron Pty Ltd was formed in 2019 to commercially develop this concept and fund ongoing research including the conclusion of this work. In 2020, Skin2Neuron acquired the IP and MV now serves the company as chief executive officer with a financial interest.</p>
