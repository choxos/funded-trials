                  <p>Despite the magnitude of alcohol use problems globally, treatment uptake remains low.

Despite high alcohol problem severity (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test: mean = 21.54, SD = 6.30; 63.37% probable dependence), multiple barriers to accessing treatment were endorsed (mean = 5.64, SD = 2.41), and fewer than one-third (29.36%) had previously accessed treatment. LCA revealed a two-class model: a ‘low problem recognition’ class (43.32%) endorsed readiness-for-change and attitudinal barriers; a ‘complex barriers’ class (56.68%) endorsed stigma, structural, attitudinal and readiness-to-change barriers, with complex barrier class membership predicted by female sex (adjusted OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.28, 0.72) and higher psychological distress (adjusted OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.08, 1.18).</p>

                  <p>The majority of people accessing this telephone-delivered intervention were new to treatment, yet had high alcohol problem severity. Two distinct profiles emerged, for which telephone interventions may overcome barriers to care and tailored approaches should be explored (e.g. increasing problem awareness, reducing psychological distress). Public health strategies to address stigma, and raise awareness about the low levels of drinking that constitute problem alcohol use, are needed to increase help-seeking.</p>

              <p>Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality globally, resulting in 5.3% (3 million) of all deaths and 5.1% of all disease burden annually (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Griswold <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>), with alcohol-attributable burden of disease increasing over time (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Murray <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Alcohol use disorders are estimated to affect 5.1% of the adult population worldwide (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>), yet rates of treatment uptake remain low in sharp contrast to the magnitude of alcohol consumption and attributable harms. In high income countries, fewer than 10% of people with an alcohol use disorder receive treatment, which is among the lowest treatment coverage of any mental health disorder (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Rehm <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). When treatment is sought, delays are substantial, with first treatment contact occurring a median of 18 years following the development of alcohol problems (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Chapman <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). From a public health perspective, identifying alternative approaches that overcome obstacles to treatment is imperative to encourage earlier help-seeking.</p>
              <p>Low rates of help-seeking for alcohol use problems are associated with multiple individual-level and structural barriers (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Oleski <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Probst <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schuler <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Bernard <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Studies with treatment-naïve cohorts and those accessing in-person services have shown the most prevalent barrier to alcohol treatment to be low problem awareness (i.e. alcohol consumption is not considered to be problematic or warranting treatment) (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Oleski <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Probst <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schuler <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). However, a recent systematic review identified <italic toggle="yes">shame and stigma</italic> to be the most prevalent barrier (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>) followed by low perceived treatment need (operationalized to involve low problem awareness, and perceptions that the problem would resolve itself, was not severe enough to require treatment, and that one should be able to handle the problem alone) (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">desire to keep drinking</italic> (i.e. enjoyment of drinking, not wanting to abstain) was also identified as a prominent barrier preventing access to treatment (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Structural barriers</italic> (i.e. financial constraints, transportation, treatment wait times and geographical proximity to treatment services) were less commonly identified (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>). Moreover, since 2020, access to treatment has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a global public health emergency that has further increased alcohol consumption and related harms among vulnerable groups (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Pollard <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Sallie <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Ogeil <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and which has led to the rapid expansion of telehealth use worldwide in response to government policies aimed at containing virus transmission (e.g. social distancing, lockdowns).</p>
              <p>Telephone-delivered interventions have considerable potential to overcome many of the structural (e.g. distance to services, in-person treatment wait times) and individual (e.g. readiness for in-person treatment, fear of shame/stigma) barriers to accessing treatment for alcohol problems. Yet, until now they have been underutilized in substance use populations (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), other than for promoting smoking cessation (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Stead <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). An emerging body of literature provides evidence for the benefits of telephone-delivered interventions for alcohol use problems (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Heinemans <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Gates and Albertella, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Grigg <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2022</xref>); telephone-delivered interventions have been shown to be comparable to in-person treatment in reducing alcohol consumption (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Gates and Albertella, 2016</xref>), enable experiences of therapeutic alliance and rapport building (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Bernard <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), and there is growing evidence that they are filling a gap in service provision for health inequity groups (e.g. women, people living in regional and remote areas) (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Grigg <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, no known studies have formally investigated the barriers to help-seeking experienced by individuals accessing alcohol treatment via this platform, or whether these more accessible services are engaging people earlier in their treatment trajectories.</p>
              <p>Therefore, this study sought to determine the proportion of people presenting to telephone-delivered alcohol treatment who are first-time help-seekers, and utilized latent class analysis (LCA) to identify relatively homogenous and unobserved (i.e. latent) classes of individuals based on perceived barriers to help-seeking for alcohol use problems, to increase our understanding of the barriers this format of treatment may help to address.</p>

Participants were recruited from across Australia between May 2018 and October 2019 via social media advertising, clinician referrals, and advertising in University and hospital newsletters. Recruitment material invited people to participate who were interested in receiving one of two telephone-delivered support programs to help them reduce their alcohol use. Participants aged ≥18 years with problem alcohol use indicated by an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Babor <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) score of &gt;6 (females) or &gt;7 (males) were recruited between May 2018 and October 2019. Individuals with severe alcohol dependence requiring urgent medical treatment, low-risk alcohol consumption, a history of psychosis, active suicidality, an acquired brain injury, attending other alcohol treatment, experiencing substantial hearing impairment, and pregnant women were excluded via initial screening assessment. Full details of the trial have been published (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Lubman <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).

                <p>Estimated resident population (ERP) data for Australia were used to calculate the rate of participation by geographic remoteness area (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018</xref>). ERP counts for each remoteness classification were averaged over calendar years 2018–2019 to provide an average population estimate by geographic area, collapsed to (a) metropolitan: major cities of Australia; (b) non-metropolitan: inner regional Australia, outer regional Australia, remote Australia, and very remote Australia. Rates of participation by metropolitan/non-metropolitan area were provided as rate per 100,000 population. Summary data were presented as counts and percentages for categorical variables, and means and standard deviations (SD) for numeric variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson’s chi-squared tests were used to examine associations between trial eligibility/non-eligibility and demographic/clinical variables.</p>
                <p>Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify latent classes of individuals with similar response patterns on the NESARC’s set of 15 binary indicator variables addressing specific barriers to alcohol treatment (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Grant <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schuler <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). To determine the optimal number of latent classes, LCA models of increasing sizes were sequentially estimated, with model fit examined using Akaike information criterion (AIC) (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Akaike, 1987</xref>), Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and adjusted BIC (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz, 1978</xref>), and Lo–Mendell–Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR LRT) (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Lo <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Entropy was also reported to give an indication of class discrimination. Once the most parsimonious latent class model was determined, associations between treatment barrier class membership and demographic/clinical characteristics were explored using bivariate analyses. To examine the variables that best predict latent class membership, a multivariable logistic regression model was then built by including those predictor variables of latent class membership that were statistically significant in bivariate analyses (at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Age and sex were included as covariates in the final model. As missingness was extremely low (i.e. ≤0.3% for all variables), an available-case approach to missingness was appropriate.

Participants had a mean age of 39.86 years (SD = 11.36, range 18–73 years), and just over half were male; there were 28 (8.14%) culturally and linguistically diverse participants, and 9 participants (2.62%) identified as being of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander descent. While two-thirds of participants lived in a metropolitan area, the rate of participation by geographic area was higher for non-metropolitan (1.6 per 100,000 population) than for metropolitan areas (1.3 per 100,000 population). Participants consumed alcohol an average of 19.90 (SD = 8.05) days in the past month, with an average of 15.45 (SD = 9.10) heavy drinking days (i.e. &gt;4 standard drinks consumed) in the past month; mean alcohol problem severity based on the AUDIT was 21.54 (SD = 6.30) and nearly two-thirds (218, 63.37%) had a score in the highest symptom category of probable dependence.

                <p>Indices of model fit were compared across one-, two-, three-, four- and five-class models (<xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The AIC and aBIC were not found to have a low point and thus were not useful in indicating model fit. Whilst the LMR p-value provided some evidence that a three-class model was better fitting than a two-class model (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.012), there was a clear inflection point using BIC with the two-class model found to have the best fit. Given these results, the two-class model was determined to be the most optimal and parsimonious fit for the data. The retained two-class model had an entropy of 0.749, suggesting reliable class differentiation.</p>

                <p>Participants belonging to the low problem recognition class had a moderate-to-high probability of endorsing most barriers in two domains: readiness for change and attitudinal barriers. Barriers in these two domains are commonly reported by alcohol use populations and taken together are considered to indicate low problem awareness and perceived treatment need (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>). The low problem recognition class had a very low probability of endorsing stigma, structural and financial barriers to alcohol treatment (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Participants belonging to the complex barriers class had a moderate-to-high probability of endorsing most barriers in four domains: attitudinal, readiness for change, stigma, and structural barriers. The complex barriers class had a low probability of endorsing financial barriers to alcohol treatment (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Of individuals with alcohol use problems from the general population presenting to a trial of telephone-delivered treatment, the majority (70.64%) were first-time help-seekers, despite two-thirds experiencing high levels of alcohol problem severity. This finding exceeds estimates from previous research that approximately one-third of clients accessing telephone-delivered alcohol interventions experience high alcohol problem severity (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Heinemans <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). While telehealth services are considered an initial point of contact with the alcohol treatment system, and aim to facilitate earlier intervention, our results show that offering support by telephone attracted a larger proportion of people with high alcohol problem severity who had not previously accessed treatment, suggesting that this format of treatment may be overcoming barriers to care for this at-risk group.</p>
              <p>In the current study, nearly half of participants accessing telephone-delivered alcohol treatment were female. This is in contrast to Australian alcohol treatment data that show two-thirds of clients accessing alcohol treatment are male (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2021</xref>), and suggests that telehealth may be filling a gap in service provision for women, who experience heightened barriers due to social stigma, complex trauma, childcare responsibilities and/or child custody concerns (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Walter <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Garde <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Grigg <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). This finding, along with evidence of gender-specific aspects of problem alcohol consumption (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Brienza and Stein, 2002</xref>) and increasing rates of alcohol consumption among women in some age groups (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">McCaul <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">AIHW, 2020</xref>), make a case for tailoring telephone-delivered alcohol treatment programs to meet the specific needs of women. Additionally, a higher rate of participation was observed among individuals located in non-metropolitan areas, compared to metropolitan areas. This finding contributes to the growing body of research showing the relatively greater uptake of telephone-delivered alcohol and other drug services among people living in regional and remote areas (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Grigg <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), who are disproportionately affected by alcohol use and related harms (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">AIHW, 2020</xref>), yet receive fewer episodes of treatment (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">AIHW, 2019</xref>) and may experience heightened barriers to accessing treatment (e.g. lack of anonymity in smaller communities, geographical distance to services) (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>Latent class analysis identified two distinct profiles of participants in terms of the barriers to seeking treatment: (a) a low problem recognition class, which was more likely to endorse readiness for change and attitudinal barriers, and (b) a complex barriers class, which was differentiated by a higher number of barriers endorsed (approximately twice that of the low problem recognition class) and endorsed attitudinal, readiness for change, and also stigma and structural barriers. These findings are partially consistent with previous research that has found classes differentiated by high and low frequency of barriers experienced by non-treatment seeking individuals with alcohol problems (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schuler <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). However, this is the first known study to examine barriers to help-seeking experienced by people presenting for telephone-delivered alcohol treatment. Results indicate two distinct barrier profiles for which the telephone format of treatment could be helping to overcome, including a low problem recognition subgroup, and a large subgroup experiencing a more complex set of barriers across multiple domains. Stigma about problem alcohol use persists as a major barrier to alcohol problem recognition and help-seeking (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>). In the present study, stigma-related barriers were endorsed predominantly by the complex barriers class. Similarly, structural barriers were endorsed only by the complex barriers class. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of barriers to alcohol treatment than prevalence data permit by demonstrating subgroups that perceive and experience different treatment barriers, for whom differential intervention strategies (e.g. increasing problem recognition, therapies to address shame associated with problem alcohol use) should be explored.</p>
              <p>Complex barrier class membership was predicted by female sex and higher psychological distress. This is consistent with previous research that has found people with alcohol and psychological comorbidity experience heightened barriers to treatment (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Kaufmann <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Additionally, while men are more likely than women to experience alcohol use problems (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">AIHW, 2020</xref>), women are more likely to face multiple barriers to accessing treatment (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Walter <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Garde <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) and may be at risk of adverse physiological and psychological health outcomes at lower drinking levels (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Walter <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Taken together, these findings provide important information on a large subgroup of participants for whom telephone-delivered alcohol intervention may be filling a critical unmet need. Findings point to the need for telephone-delivered models of alcohol treatment that integrate gender-specific and mental health treatment approaches.</p>
              <p>The belief that one should be able to handle the problem alone is consistently identified as a prominent barrier preventing access to alcohol treatment among non-treatment seekers (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Oleski <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schuler <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>), as well as access to treatment for mental health problems more broadly (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Prins <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2011</xref>); this was the barrier most frequently reported by participants in this study, and was more likely to be endorsed by the complex barriers class. Also consistent with previous research (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Probst <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schuler <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), the belief that the problem is not severe enough to warrant treatment was a prominent barrier among the current sample, despite the high level of alcohol problem severity observed. Some research has suggested that people with alcohol use problems are motivated to maintain low problem recognition to avoid threat to the self-concept from identifying as a problem drinker, reinforced by the social stigma of alcoholism (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Morris <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Low problem awareness may also be driven by the prevailing social norms of heavy alcohol use specific to Western culture, as well as prolific (and exceedingly innovative) alcohol marketing and the frequent glamourization of alcohol consumption in media, which promote a culture of alcohol use where positive outcomes are anticipated (e.g. celebration, social connection, attractiveness) and the potential for harms are minimized or ignored. Public health strategies that counter this normalization of drinking to shift perceptions and raise awareness that even low levels of drinking cause harm/constitute problem alcohol use – and promoting alternative, easily accessible and less intensive treatment options such as telephone-delivered interventions—may increase help-seeking (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Oleski <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Probst <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), particularly among the population who are already at high risk of alcohol harms but are yet to perceive a need for treatment (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Probst <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The data utilized in this study was drawn from a treatment-seeking sample recruited to an alcohol treatment trial; data collection was rigorous and standardized, and the dataset was reviewed and cleaned prior to analysis. LCA is a rigorous model-based approach that provides several fit statistics to assess model fit, and is appropriate for studying and classifying heterogeneity within a population. However, the cross-sectional nature of the data precludes the temporal ordering of variables, and it is recognized that class membership could change over alcohol consumption and help-seeking trajectories. Data on participants’ perceived treatment barriers were collected using binary indicator variables belonging to five pre-defined domains used in previous research (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Grant <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schuler <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). While barrier domains were upheld in the current study, domain constructs could be refined in future studies (e.g. readiness for change domain does not align consistently with the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change) (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Prochaska and DiClemente, 1982</xref>). The question eliciting information on barriers to help-seeking did not specifically refer to barriers experienced in the context of no treatment, and as such this question may also have elicited information on barriers experienced in the context of receiving treatment (i.e. treatment was accessed despite barriers being experienced); barriers experienced in the context of treatment may be conceptually different and should be considered in future research. Further, barrier items were originally developed to identify barriers to alcohol treatment in the US population and some items may not have been as relevant to our Australian cohort (e.g. financial barriers: the majority of alcohol treatment services in Australia are publicly funded and available at no cost to the individual). However, this item may still have potential relevance as campaigns to promote these publicly-funded services are lacking and many individuals wait months to commence treatment (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Health Complaints Commissioner, 2021</xref>). Barriers to alcohol treatment were reported by a treatment-seeking group with the findings not generalizable to the sizeable hidden population not presenting for treatment. Barriers to help-seeking vary considerably according to personal, cultural, and socio-economic factors; this was an Australian sample and the majority of participants were employed, with tertiary education beyond Year 12, and meeting inclusion for the parent trial, which limits the generalizability of the results including the latent class structure observed. While the telephone format of treatment delivery has the potential to overcome many of the treatment barriers reported by participants, no direct relationship between perceived barriers and the uptake of telephone treatment can be inferred from this study; it is recognized that other factors can also be influential in seeking help (e.g. disruptions to health or relationships, fluctuating motivation) (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">May and Nielsen, 2019</xref>). Additionally, there are likely specific barriers to telephone-delivered alcohol treatment (e.g. difficulty in achieving privacy to participate in a telephone session) that were not assessed by the current study. Indeed, barriers and facilitators of treatment likely vary across alcohol consumption and treatment-seeking trajectories, presenting multiple areas of future investigation to increase identification of treatment need, help-seeking, and treatment uptake.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p>The majority of people presenting to telephone-delivered treatment for alcohol use problems were new to treatment, yet had high alcohol problem severity. More needs to be done to engage people with these easily accessible interventions earlier in their drinking trajectories. Participants had experienced multiple barriers to alcohol treatment, with the most strongly endorsed barrier being the attitudinal barrier, <italic toggle="yes">‘Thought I should be strong enough to handle it alone’</italic>. LCA identified two profiles regarding barriers to help-seeking, a ‘low problem recognition’ class, and a ‘complex barriers’ class (predicted by female sex and higher psychological distress), for which telephone interventions may overcome barriers to care and tailored approaches should be explored (e.g. increasing problem awareness, reducing psychological distress). Public health strategies to address stigma, and raise awareness about the low levels of drinking that constitute problem alcohol use, are needed to increase help-seeking.</p>
