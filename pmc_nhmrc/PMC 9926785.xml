                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Preliminary evidence suggests that web-based physical activity interventions with tailored advice and Fitbit integration are effective and may be well suited to older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the engagement, acceptability, usability, and satisfaction with â<italic>Active for Life</italic>,â a web-based physical activity intervention providing computer-tailored physical activity advice to older adults.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Inactive older adults (<italic>n</italic>â=â243) were randomly assigned into 3 groups: 1) tailoringâ+âFitbit, 2) tailoring only, or 3) a wait-list control. The tailoringâ+âFitbit group and the tailoring-only group received 6 modules of computer-tailored physical activity advice over 12Â weeks. The advice was informed by objective Fitbit data in the tailoringâ+âFitbit group and self-reported physical activity in the tailoring-only group. This study examined the engagement, acceptability, usability, and satisfaction of <italic>Active for Life</italic> in intervention participants (tailoringâ+âFitbit <italic>n</italic>â=â78, tailoring only <italic>n</italic>â=â96). Wait-list participants were not included. Engagement (Module completion, time on site) were objectively recorded through the intervention website. Acceptability (7-point Likert scale), usability (System Usability Scale), and satisfaction (open-ended questions) were assessed using an online survey at post intervention. ANOVA and Chi square analyses were conducted to compare outcomes between intervention groups and content analysis was used to analyse program satisfaction.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">At post-intervention (week 12), study attrition was 28% (22/78) in the Fitbitâ+âtailoring group and 39% (37/96) in the tailoring-only group. Engagement and acceptability were good in both groups, however there were no group differences (module completions: tailoringâ+âFitbit: 4.72âÂ±â2.04, Tailoring-only: 4.23âÂ±â2.25 out of 6 modules, <italic>p</italic>â=â.14, time on site: tailoringâ+âFitbit: 103.46âÂ±â70.63, Tailoring-only: 96.90âÂ±â76.37Â min in total, <italic>p</italic>â=â.56, and acceptability of the advice: tailoringâ+âFitbit: 5.62âÂ±â0.89, Tailoring-only: 5.75âÂ±â0.75 out of 7, <italic>p</italic>â=â.41). Intervention usability was modest but significantly higher in the tailoringâ+âFitbit group (tailoringâ+âFitbit: 64.55âÂ±â13.59, Tailoring-only: 57.04âÂ±â2.58 out of 100, <italic>p</italic>â=â.003). Participants reported that <italic>Active for Life</italic> helped motivate them, held them accountable, improved their awareness of how active they were and helped them to become more active. Conversely, many participants felt as though they would prefer personal contact, more detailed tailoring and more survey response options.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par10">Despite the fact that physical activity benefits healthy ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], a large proportion of older adults 65â+âyears are not meeting the physical activity recommendations of 30Â min on most days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The percentage of older Australians aged 65â+âyears who regularly connect to the internet is high and growing (62%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and web-based physical activity interventions have shown to be effective at increasing physical activity in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Specifically, web-based computer-tailored interventions which provide personalised physical activity advice to participants have shown to be effective at increasing physical activity in adults 18â+âyears of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Older adults have a higher prevalence of health issues (e.g., diabetes, cancer, heart disease) and co-morbidities which are associated with physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, web-based computer-tailored interventions have much potential for older adults as they can personalise physical activity advice based on such health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite this, few studies have specifically tested the effectiveness of computer-tailored physical activity advice built for adults 65â+âyears and those studies that have demonstrated mixed results in terms of increasing physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Computer-tailored advice is typically based on a brief survey of participantsâ physical activity levels, characteristics, environment, and psychosocial correlates of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, new technology allows the physical activity component to be measured via advanced activity trackers (e.g., Fitbit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Fitbit integration has been shown to improve usability, non-usage attrition, acceptability, and effectiveness of computer tailored advice in adults 18â+âyears of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interventions using activity trackers in older adults are effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], however no studies have tested the acceptability of Fitbit data to inform computer-tailored physical activity advice in older adults. In general, the uptake of activity trackers is lower in the older adult age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and it is unknown if Fitbit integration would be well received by older adults.</p>
              <p id="Par12">Older adults may interact with computer-tailored advice and Fitbit technology differently than middle-aged adults who make up most participants in evaluations of computer-tailored interventions and activity trackers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. More broadly, older adults are typically more reserved towards new technology and more sensitive to design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Some evidence suggests that older adults demonstrate good compliance and are satisfied with using Fitbit activity trackers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, there is research that indicates that non-usage attrition in web-based computer-tailored programs increases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Currently, we do not know how older adults interact with an perceive a web-based computer-tailored physical activity intervention with Fitbit integration.</p>
              <p id="Par13">We recently conducted a randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of a web-based physical activity intervention (<italic>Active for Life)</italic> providing tailored physical activity advice with and without Fitbit integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Results demonstrated that the Fitbit and tailoring group increased their Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) from baseline to post-intervention by 14Â min per week which was statistically significant compared to the control group who decreased their MVPA by 49Â min per week, but not statistically significant compared to the tailored advice only group who decreased their MVPA by 8Â min per week. The MVPA changes from baseline to post-intervention in the tailored advice only group compared to the control group were not statistically significant. There were no group differences at 6Â months follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A detailed process evaluation is needed to understand why the Fitbit integration did not improve intervention efficacy and why the tailored physical activity advice alone was not effective in comparison to a wait-list control. Understanding how participants interacted with the <italic>Active for Life</italic> intervention will help to explain these results and inform the development of future web-based physical activity interventions for older adults. Therefore, this study aims to examine the engagement, acceptability, usability, and satisfaction of <italic>Active for Life,</italic> a web-based computer-tailored physical activity intervention for older adults with and without Fitbit integration.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par14">This study presents process data from the <italic>Active for Life</italic> intervention. The original <italic>Active for Life</italic> trial was a 3-group Randomised Controlled Trial where participants were randomised into one of three groups: 1) tailoringâ+âFitbit, 2) tailored advice only and 3) wait list control. The protocol is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This process evaluation study of <italic>Active for Life</italic> included all intervention participants (tailoringâ+âFitbit and tailored advice only). Control participants were not included as they were not given access to the intervention until after the study. Objective website usage data (engagement) and acceptability, usability, and satisfaction data from a post-intervention survey (week 12) are analysed.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par15">Recruitment was conducted between April 2018 and March 2019 in Rockhampton (Regional Queensland), Bundaberg (Regional Queensland), and Adelaide (Metropolitan South Australia), Australia through Facebook advertising, university email lists, flyers and local newsletters. Eligible participants were adults agedââ¥â65Â years, who were speaking English, had Internet access, basic Internet confidence and could attend two face-to-face appointments at one of the project locations. Participants had to be able to safely increase their physical activity as assessed through the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] or approval from their General Practitioner. Participants were ineligible if they were already meeting the physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], participating in another physical activity program or had used a Fitbit in the previous 6Â months.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par16">The <italic>Active for Life</italic> intervention is a web-based program with computer-tailored advice to encourage older adults to work towards meeting the physical activity recommendations of 30Â min of moderate intensity activity on at least 5Â days each week including 2â3 sessions of strength and flexibility activity. The program included 6 modules of tailored advice delivered fortnightly over 12-weeks. The tailored advice is computer automated and uses participant data to select appropriate messages from a database of messages using IFâTHEN algorithms (e.g., IF âinactiveâ AND âlow social supportâ THEN âdisplay message on joining a group or classâ). The advice was informed by the theory of planned behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and the social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and includes evidence-based behaviour change techniques such as self-monitoring, goal setting, action planning, habit formation and relapse prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The advice is tailored to participantsâ characteristics, environment, physical activity behaviour and psychosocial correlates of physical activity (e.g., self-efficacy and social support). Each module of advice included around 10 brief sections (e.g., progress, losing weight, goal setting, exercise with arthritis). Some sections include a graph or picture. New modules could be accessed when previous modules were completed. Participants received up to 3 automatic reminder emails to complete a new session.</p>
                <p id="Par17">A feature for creating action plans was included on the website. At the end of modules 2 and 4, all participants were encouraged to use this action planning tool to guide them in setting an action plan â the what, where, when and with whom â for being active in the following fortnight. An exercise library feature was also included on the website for participants to access 4-week strength and flexibility exercise plans. These plans were written by a physiotherapist at the beginners and/or intermediate level and participants could view video demonstrations of the exercises through a link to an external website hosted by <italic>PhysiTrackÂ®</italic>. Participants were encouraged to use these plans if they were not participating in at least 2 sessions of strength and flexibility activity per week and wanted a guide to do these at home.</p>
                <p id="Par18">All intervention participants in the both the tailoringâ+âFitbit and the tailoring only groups were given access to the same <italic>Active for Life</italic> intervention website including the 6 modules of computer-tailored advice, action planning tool and exercise library. Both groups completed a brief questionnaire at the start of each module to inform the computer tailored advice. The only between group difference was that the personalised physical activity advice in the tailoringâ+âFitbit group was based on data collected through their Fitbit, whereas in the tailoring only group the advice was based on the answers to additional questions asking them to recall how many minutes of physical activity they had completed in the past two weeks. All other questions (e.g., sitting time, self-efficacy, social support etc.) were identical.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="Par19">Recruitment materials directed participants to a landing page on the <italic>Active for Life</italic> website where they completed an eligibility survey and eligible participants were invited to complete baseline assessments. Participation included completion of four online research surveys at baseline, week 6, week 12 and week 24 and wearing an accelerometer for 7 consecutive 24-h days at baseline and week 12. Participants were sent an accelerometer via the postal service and attended a baseline appointment to return the accelerometer. During the baseline appointment participants were randomly allocated to one of the three trial arms (tailoringâ+âFitbit, tailored advice only and wait list control) using computer-automated block randomization with block sizes of 15 and a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by age (&lt;â75Â years,ââ¥â75Â years) and sex (male, female). They were then shown through the intervention website. Tailoringâ+âFitbit participants were provided with a Fitbit Flex 1 (original model) which tracks steps, distance, calories burned, active minutes, stationary time, and sleep. It has no visual display but 5 lights to indicate progress towards a step goal. Tailoringâ+âFitbit participants were then guided in syncing their Fitbit Flex to the intervention website. First, they set up a Fitbit account and synced their Fitbit Flex to the Fitbit app on their smartphone, tablet or to the Fitbit website through a USB dongle. They then provided Fitbit with permission for the <italic>Active for Life</italic> website to extract their activity minutes summary data from their Fitbit account. During the intervention participants only needed to press one button at the start of each module for <italic>Active for Life</italic> to extract their latest activity minutes data from Fitbit. Participants received a take home sheet with their Fitbit device which encouraged them to wear the Fitbit as much as possible (taking it off to swim and shower) and manually add any water-based activities through the Fitbit app or website. Participants were asked to make sure their Fitbit had recently synced with their Fitbit account prior to each <italic>Active for Life</italic> module and to record their strength, flexibility and balance exercises in each <italic>Active for Life</italic> module. After the 12-week intervention, participants attended another face-to-face appointment to return the week 12 accelerometer. Participants received up to 3 automatic reminder emails for each research survey. If the surveys were still incomplete after the reminders, participants were offered a $20 voucher to complete them within the next few days. Participants received a $50 voucher after completing all research surveys.</p>

These features were rated more useful in the tailoring only group with borderline significance.

                <p id="Par70">The main aim of this study was to compare engagement, perceived usefulness, acceptability, usability, and satisfaction of the <italic>Active for Life</italic> intervention groups. Perceived usefulness of the whole program was reasonable with 82% of participants agreeing that it was useful. Website usage (100Â min across 9.5 visits) in both groups were very good compared to similar studies in younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] (77â90Â min total, 7.3â7.6 modules). Participants reported through the open-ended questions that they have good levels of satisfaction of the <italic>Active for Life</italic> program and that it helped motivate them, hold them accountable, improved their awareness and helped them to change their behaviour. The main dislikes were that external factors prevented them from making the most of the program and that they would prefer some personal contact. No web-based physical activity interventions with computer-tailored advice for older adults have reported usefulness, engagement, and satisfaction outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], however other web-based physical activity interventions have been well received by older adults in terms of usefulness and acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Wallbank, Sherrington, Hassett, Kwasnicka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] found 83% of participants to recommend a non-tailored web-based physical activity program for women over 50Â years. The current findings add to the literature by supporting the viability of a physical activity intervention with tailored advice for older adults.</p>

              <sec id="Sec26">
                <title>Tailored physical activity advice</title>
                <p id="Par71">The module completion rates (4.5 out of 6 modules) in both groups were very good compared to similar studies in younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] (2.9â5/8 modules). Acceptability of the physical activity advice was also good (7/9). Therefore, the lack of significant physical activity changes in the tailoring only participants presented in the main outcomes paper is unlikely to be due to the lack of engagement or acceptability of the tailored advice modules. The participants were engaged enough to complete most of the modules; however, this content was not enough to lead to significant physical activity changes. Perhaps different or additional content in the modules would have been more effective. However, the <italic>Active for Life</italic> program adhered to theory and evidence-based behaviour change techniques.</p>
                <p id="Par72">Whilst some participants mentioned in their open-ended responses that they liked the tailored advice, many felt as though the advice was not tailored enough, that the surveys to inform the advice did not capture their situation, and that the incidental activities they already do were not factored into the advice. This might partially explain why the tailored advice alone did not lead to improved physical activity changes. Future interventions could consider further personalising the advice to better factor in participantsâ situations such as age, external barriers, and incidental activities. This could be done through personal contact to discuss the tailored advice, adding further variables to tailor the advice on, or through use of a machine learning based chatbot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par73">The high number of participants who agreed to the acceptability question âI thought that too much physical activity advice was providedâ (49%) is not in line with past studies evaluating tailored physical activity advice. These studies found only 14% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] of participants thought that too much advice was provided per session and 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] of participants thought that too many modules were provided. This is interesting considering <italic>Active for Life</italic> had less modules of similar length compared to these programs. The other acceptability ratings of the tailored advice in <italic>Active for Life</italic> were good, making it unlikely that the advice seemed long because they were not satisfied with it. Whilst the reason for this high aggregated rating is not clear, it suggests that future programs providing tailored advice to older adults should ensure that the tailored advice is kept succinct.</p>

                <title>Fitbit to inform tailored physical activity advice</title>
                <p id="Par74">There were no differences between intervention groups for time reading advice or module completion. This is not consistent with the findings of Vandelanotte, Duncan, Maher, Schoeppe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] who found computer-tailored physical activity advice based on Fitbit data to have more module completions (4.4/8) than tailoring only physical activity advice (2.9/8) in adults 18â+âyears. Further, provision of a Fitbit Flex device did not improve the perceived usefulness of the program or acceptability of the tailored advice. It was anticipated that using objective Fitbit data to inform the advice would lead participants to more likely to agree that the advice taught them something new about their activity, was credible or help to hold them accountable in line with adults 18â+âyears in Vandelanotte, Duncan, Maher, Schoeppe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] who used the same Fitbit Flex device. The lack of differences between groups may be as the Fitbit integration with the tailored advice was not as well received by adults 65â+âyears of age compared to adults 18â+âyears of age. It could also be influenced by the overall high acceptability ratings and engagement leaving little room for improvements due to use of the Fitbit.</p>
                <p id="Par75">Use of the Fitbit Flex was good (87%-92% of participants at sessions 1â5), however this reduced slightly (78%) by the last session of the intervention (session 6, week 11). Despite the week 12 drop, usage remained higher than activity tracker usage previously observed in adults of all ages (60% at week 12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Fitbit Flex acceptability ratings (&gt;â80%) were high, except for the question âit was easy to connect with and sync Fitbit dataâ where only 40% agreed. The acceptability questions related to the Fitbit itself (e.g., âdid the Fitbit make you more activeâ) were scored higher (89â93%) than the questions regarding acceptability of the Fitbit data informing the tailored advice (81%). Additionally, the responses to the open-ended questions demonstrated that participants liked using the Fitbit device itself as it monitored their activity which improved their awareness and motivation. Participants liked monitoring their sleep and setting goals directly with their Fitbit but did not discuss how it informed their tailored physical activity advice. Therefore, participants might have benefited from the Fitbit mostly as a separate program component rather than its integration with the <italic>Active for Life</italic> website to inform the tailored advice. This could explain why acceptability of the tailored advice was not improved in the Fitbitâ+âtailoring participants. The high usage and high ratings of acceptability of the Fitbit itself is in line with past research which found high usage and acceptability of activity trackers to motivate older adults to increase their activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although the use of the Fitbit did not improve the acceptability or effectiveness of the tailored advice intervention, these good Fitbit usage and acceptability results demonstrate that the Fitbit is a viable strategy to use in future interventions targeting older adults. Responses to the open-ended questions suggest that future interventions should consider using a reliable model of activity tracker which has an easy to do up clasp and a long battery life. Consideration should also be given to providing a device that more accurately tracks a range of activities (e.g., heart rate monitor and altimeter), thatâs comfortable to wear and that doubles as a watch so two devices donât need to be worn.</p>

                <title>Usability of the intervention website</title>
                <p id="Par76">The usability rating in both groups was under the average rating of 68 out of 100. The specific areas of concern were that the website was inconsistent, cumbersome, and complex and that participants felt they needed to learn a lot before using the website and needed help. The under average rating tends to be the case in e-health systems for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and shows the need for developers of e-health systems for older adults to ensure these systems are specifically designed in line with older adultsâ needs and preferences. Responses to the open-ended questions demonstrated that participants had a range of difficulties with the website technology including the password, printing content, and accessing the strength exercises on the external website. Usability could be improved by providing instructions or âhow toâ videos for website functions including resetting passwords and printing content and by improving the way the exercises are integrated in the website to allow participants to seamlessly connect and access the exercise plans. System updates based on detailed usability testing has been shown to improve usability ratings of e-health systems for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and should be included in the development process. This process should help to avoid perceived inconsistencies, complexity, and cumbersome nature of future e-health websites for older adults.</p>
                <p id="Par77">Consistent with a trial in participants 18â+âyears of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the tailoringâ+âFitbit group rated the website usability significantly higher overall compared to the tailoring only group. When looking at the individual usability questions less Fitbitâ+âtailoring participants found the website unnecessarily complex compared to the tailoring only participants, despite the added complexity of having to sync Fitbit data. The only difference between the websites was that the tailoringâ+âFitbit group synced their physical activity data from their Fitbit at each module which 60% of Fitbitâ+âtailoring participants found challenging. Therefore, the higher usability ratings in the Fitbitâ+âtailoring group may be as the website more generally seems easy to use compared to the Fitbit and syncing the Fitbit with the website.</p>

                <title>Action planning tool and exercise program</title>
                <p id="Par78">The action planning tool and strength, balance, and flexibility exercise programs were perceived as useful for about half of participants. Time on exercise plans and action plans were also low and less than a third completed two action plans. Many participants discussed the exercise plans in the open-ended satisfaction questions. Participants liked that there were exercise plans to follow but many felt as though they could have been better tailored to their abilities. Therefore, to improve perceived usefulness and engagement with the exercise plans, they could be better tailored to participants abilities. A short assessment could be carried out at the start of the program to provide a tailored plan to participants. Unlike the exercise plans, action plans were barely mentioned in the open-ended satisfaction questions. Other web-based health behaviour change programs in younger adults also found low use of action plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. As action planning is associated with improved behaviour change, future web-based physical activity interventions should consider engaging ways to improve uptake of action planning tools. Time on exercise plans, completion of two out of two action plans and usefulness ratings of these features were improved in the tailoring only group and these group differences were borderline significant. This may be as participants in the Fitbitâ+âtailoring group found the Fitbit a more helpful to engaging in physical activity and therefore rated the other features lower. It may also be that the Fitbit didnât integrate well with these other features. For example, the exercise plans were made up of strength, balance and flexibility exercises that are not well tracked by the Fitbit. They may have therefore been more motivated to do activities such as walking to increase their activity as measured by the Fitbit.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par79">The strengths of the study include randomisation to each intervention group, objective website and module completion measures, and qualitative data to add context and understanding to the qualitative findings. The study also had a good representation of people with a low household income (46%â&lt;âA$40,000). A limitation includes the phone and face-to-face contact between participants and researchers, as well as monetary incentives which may have encouraged participants to engage with the intervention more than they would in a real-world scenario. In particular, the face-to face meeting with researchers at baseline may have helped to remove barriers to participation (e.g., syncing Fitbit to the website) and the website usability ratings and Fitbit acceptability ratings may not generalise to a real world scenario without hands on support. Lastly, Fitbit usage was measured by self-report and estimated from daily active minutes recorded by the Fitbit in the week prior to each <italic>Active for Life</italic> session. Future studies should consider recording continuous objective usage data (e.g., extract previous fortnight at each fortnightly session) over the entire intervention. Future studies could also consider using more advanced activity trackers to calculate wear time from heart rate data.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par80">Engagement, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction of the overall program were good. Engagement and acceptability of the tailored advice specifically were good despite the main outcomes paper reporting no physical activity changes observed in the tailored advice only participants. Participants explained that they wanted further personalisation of the tailored advice and/or personal contact. Fitbit integration did not improve the engagement or acceptability of the tailored advice, however participants engaged with and felt as though they benefited from using a Fitbit device. Usability ratings of the website were modest but highest in the Fitbitâ+âtailored advice group. The action planning tool and exercise plans had a low engagement and perceived usefulness, and many participants felt as though the exercise plans were not well tailored to their abilities. Future web-based behaviour change interventions for older adults should ensure advice and exercise plans are well tailored to participantsâ abilities, age and situation, consider including personal contact, better integrate activity tracker data with other intervention components, and ensure adequate website usability testing with the target group.</p>
