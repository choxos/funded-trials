                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Despite clinical guideline recommendations, implementation of antenatal care addressing alcohol consumption by pregnant women is limited. Implementation strategies addressing barriers to such care may be effective in increasing care provision. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of a multi-strategy practice change intervention in increasing antenatal care addressing the consumption of alcohol by pregnant women.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The study will be a randomised, stepped-wedge controlled trial conducted in three sectors in a health district in New South Wales, Australia. Stepped implementation of a practice change intervention will be delivered to sectors in a random order to support the introduction of a model of care for addressing alcohol consumption by pregnant women. A staged process was undertaken to develop the implementation strategies, which comprise of: leadership support, local clinical practice guidelines, electronic prompts and reminders, opinion leaders, academic detailing (audit and feedback), educational meetings and educational materials, and performance monitoring. Repeated cross-sectional outcome data will be gathered weekly across all sectors for the study duration. The primary outcome measures are the proportion of antenatal appointments at ‘booking in’, 27–28 weeks gestation and 35–36 weeks gestation for which women report (1) being assessed for alcohol consumption, (2) being provided with brief advice related to alcohol consumption during pregnancy, (3) receiving relevant care for addressing alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and (4) being assessed for alcohol consumption and receiving relevant care. Data on resources expended during intervention development and implementation will be collected. The proportion of women who report consuming alcohol since knowing they were pregnant will be measured as a secondary outcome.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of implementation strategies in improving antenatal care that addresses alcohol consumption by pregnant women. If positive changes in clinical practice are found, this evidence will support health service adoption of implementation strategies to support improved antenatal care for this recognised risk to the health and wellbeing of the mother and child.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par14">Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with a number of adverse obstetric, fetal and child outcomes with lifelong consequences. These include, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. No safe level of prenatal alcohol exposure has been established for the foetus and therefore many countries, including Australia, have national guidelines recommending that the safest option is for women to abstain from alcohol consumption when trying to conceive, during conception and during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Despite this recommendation, 10% of women worldwide consume alcohol during pregnancy, with notably higher prevalence estimates in regions with high levels of general alcohol consumption, such as the World Health Organisation European Region (prevalence estimate of alcohol consumption in pregnancy, 25%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Australia, national surveys and prospective cohort studies report the prevalence of maternal alcohol consumption at any time during pregnancy to be between 35 and 72% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, a prospective cohort study of 1403 women attending antenatal clinics in the Australian states of New South Wales and Western Australia found that 61% of women consumed alcohol between conception and pregnancy recognition, often at risky levels. Of these women, approximately 30% continued to drink alcohol once they were aware they were pregnant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, a study of 1570 women attending public antenatal clinics in Melbourne, Australia, found that just over half (54%) of women consumed alcohol in the first trimester, and half of these women continued to consume alcohol throughout the remainder of their pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Health services providing antenatal care represent an opportune setting to address maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Systematic review evidence shows that psychological and educational interventions for pregnant women may reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence from alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additional evidence suggests that clinician assessment of alcohol consumption and brief interventions, including motivational interviewing, may also reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Efforts to reduce alcohol consumption during pregnancy in antenatal settings is also acceptable to women, with 97% of Australian women indicating that they wanted information about alcohol use during pregnancy and would be willing to change their alcohol consumption if advised to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consistent with this evidence, international, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as well as Australian national [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and state clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] recommend that health professionals providing antenatal care use a validated tool to assess alcohol consumption for all pregnant women at the initial visit and throughout the antenatal period, provide brief advice about the potential harms of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and recommend abstinence, and refer women to specialist services if they require assistance to stop consuming alcohol.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Despite clear recommendations in clinical guidelines, implementation of antenatal care addressing maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is limited. Internationally, studies show that pregnant women are not routinely assessed for their alcohol consumption during antenatal consultations are not consistently provided with information regarding the effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and receive inconsistent advice regarding alcohol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For instance, in Canada, only 50% of health professionals report providing advice to pregnant women regarding the consumption of alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and, in the UK, only two thirds of women reported receiving such advice from a midwife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In Australia, a study of 1143 of health professionals who provide antenatal care found that fewer than half (45%) routinely asked about alcohol consumption during pregnancy, only 25% provided information on the effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and only 13% provided advice consistent with national drinking guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A more recent study involving 166 midwives in Western Australia found that while almost all midwives (93%) asked pregnant women about their alcohol consumption, only 54% used a standardised assessment tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">A small number of studies have been conducted to assess barriers to the provision of care addressing maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. These barriers include a lack of systems and/or tools to prompt clinician assessment of alcohol consumption, concerns about patient sensitivity and stigmatisation, lack of staff time, need for staff training, limited access to or knowledge of clinical and patient resources, including culturally appropriate resources for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, lack of referral options, a perceived lack of skill in delivering care, and a lack of understanding of the importance of providing such care to all women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Additionally, the literature on clinical guideline implementation more broadly indicates that other barriers (including commitment to change from organisational leaders/champions, perceived value/need and readiness to change, skills, ability and confidence, and an absence of systems and tools to support/prompt care delivery) commonly impede changes in professional practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">Cochrane reviews of strategies to improve the implementation of recommended clinical practices suggest that a variety of both organisational and individually focused strategies may be effective. These strategies include leadership, local clinical practice guidelines, electronic prompt and reminder systems, local opinion leaders, educational meetings and educational materials, academic detailing, including audit and feedback, and, monitoring the performance of the delivery of healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The effectiveness of such strategies in improving the implementation of guideline recommendations is, however, highly variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and, to maximise effectiveness, it is recommended that strategies are selected that target specific barriers to the implementation of recommended clinical practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Implementation frameworks such as the Theoretical Domains Framework have been developed to aid the selection of targeted evidence-based implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">No controlled trials have been conducted to test the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of implementation strategies in increasing the provision of recommended antenatal care that addresses maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of a multi-strategy practice change intervention in increasing maternity clinician provision of care addressing the consumption of alcohol by women during their pregnancy.</p>

The sectors are geographically defined groupings of antenatal facilities with common operational management. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, repeated cross-sectional outcome data will be gathered on a weekly basis across all three sectors for the duration of the study (34 months). Baseline (current practice/control phase) data will be collected for each of the three sectors from 7 months prior to the commencement of the intervention in the first sector to the start of the intervention in each sector. Stepped implementation of a 7-month practice change intervention will be delivered in a randomly selected order at six monthly intervals. Follow-up data will continue to be collected for all three sectors 7 months following completion of the practice change intervention in the third sector. The outcomes of the trial will be determined by comparing practice change outcomes between the baseline and follow up periods for the three sectors combined.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

                <p id="Par22">A randomised stepped-wedge controlled trial design is recommended for the evaluation of complex practice change interventions in settings such as health services as it provides a number of pragmatic and scientific advantages over a randomised controlled trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. First, it provides a similar level of evidence as a standard parallel cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Second, although all participants will receive the intervention, its sequential implementation across three sectors provides the capacity to identify secular trends, i.e. changes over time before the intervention is implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Third, the design addresses the practical difficulty of recruiting the number of similar antenatal services that would be required for a parallel cluster RCT, instead allowing each cluster to act as its own control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Finally, the design provides an opportunity for all participating services and women to receive the intervention, overcoming ethical and logistical challenges arising from withholding the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>

Participants providing outcome data will not be informed of the experimental nature of intervention implementation across services and therefore will be blind to the stage of study occurring in the service they attended.

                  <p id="Par26">It is intended that all pregnant women who attend participating services from the start of the practice change intervention in their health sector will receive the intervention. During the 34-month data collection period, women who attend an individual face-to-face antenatal appointment at three time points (i) the time of the first public antenatal service visit (from this point referred to as the ‘booking in’ visit), (ii) 27–28 weeks gestation, or (iii) 35–36 weeks gestation, will be eligible to participate in data collection surveys. To be eligible for participation in such surveys, women need to: be aged 18 years or older, be currently pregnant at more than 12 weeks gestation and less than 37 weeks gestation, have a sufficient level of English language proficiency to complete the survey unaided, and be mentally and physically capable of completing the survey. Women will be ineligible to participate in data collection surveys if they: are determined by clinical discretion to be inappropriate to contact for the survey (e.g. due to medical or social issues); and/or are receiving the majority of their antenatal care via a private obstetrician; and/or have given birth or had a negative pregnancy outcome; and/or had already been selected to participate in the survey for that care time point in the past 4 weeks; and/or had previously declined participation in the survey. The number of women deemed ineligible for the above-listed reasons will be recorded and reported.</p>
                  <p id="Par27">Each week, a sample of eligible women who attended an antenatal appointment in the past week (for booking in, 27–28 weeks gestation or 35–36 weeks gestation care) will be randomly selected via a computerised random number generator by members of the research team not involved in delivering care to women. Selected women will be mailed a participant information statement explaining the purpose of the survey 1 week prior to receiving a phone call inviting them to participate in the survey. Study posters will be displayed in antenatal clinics and pamphlets distributed in antenatal information packs provided to all women at the time of their booking in appointment. Women identified via the medical record data as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin and/or women who are attending or enrolled to attend an AMIHS will be first contacted by text message and invited to participate. If they do not respond, they will be followed up with a telephone call 4 days later. All women will have the opportunity to decline participation at any point, including opting out during the clinic visit or when they receive information in the antenatal booking in pack, when they receive the study information letter in the mail, at the time of the phone call or text message, or partway through survey completion. On the morning of the day that a woman is to be contacted via phone call or text message, medical record data will be checked and any women who are identified as having given birth or having had a negative pregnancy outcome will be deemed ineligible and not contacted.</p>

To determine reach of the implementation intervention strategies across different groups of clinicians, data will be collected from clinicians on position/profession, level of training, and length of time working in current antenatal service and in antenatal services generally. To assess delivery of the model of care across different demographic groups of women, the following information will be collected from pregnant women: age, gender, highest level of education, employment status, geographical location, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status of woman and baby, household composition, current gestation, gestation at first antenatal clinic visit, whether attending care for first or subsequent pregnancy and alcohol consumption prior pregnancy (via AUDIT-C).</p>

Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of the implementation strategies will be assessed relative to the baseline (current practice) phase in each of the three sectors. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated as the difference in average cost between the intervention and baseline phases, divided by the difference in the primary outcome.

The models will have a period term (fixed effect, reflecting pre-post difference, the main indicator of effect) and health sector term (fixed effect). Where appropriate, the models will also include fixed effects for client group (booking in, 27–28 weeks gestation, 35–36 weeks gestation) and a time term (fixed effect, to pick up any secular trend). In the latter models, a client group by period term will detect differences between the client groups in their response to the intervention. Where the interaction terms are significant, subgroup analyses will be reported for each of the three client groups. Descriptive statistics will be used to report on process measures and interventions costs. Process outcomes will be used to narratively interpret the results of primary outcome analysis.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par65">Despite the need, there is a clear absence of research evidence of the effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of implementation strategies to improve antenatal care that addresses maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of such intervention strategies. The stepped-wedge design is feasible and acceptable in the context of conducting a trial across multiple antenatal services. The study has strong design elements including random allocation of the order of strategy implementation across the health sectors and blinding of data collection staff. The implementation intervention strategies have been developed based on key implementation science frameworks and using data from surveys with antenatal services staff and managers. A research co-production approach has been employed in the design of the study and will be employed in its conduct and dissemination.</p>
              <p id="Par66">If positive changes in clinical practice are found, the study will provide evidence to support the delivery by health services of the implementation strategies to improve antenatal care addressing this recognised risk to the health and wellbeing of both the mother and child. The methods used in this trial have the potential to provide a framework for the development of initiatives for improving the implementation of models of care, both in the antenatal clinic setting and in other clinical environments.</p>
