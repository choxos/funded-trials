                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>A research priority in finding a cure for HIV is to establish methods to accurately locate and quantify where and how HIV persists in people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Infusing copper-64 (<sup>64</sup>Cu) radiolabelled broadly neutralising antibodies targeting HIV envelope (Env) with CT scan and positron emission tomography (PET) identified HIV Env in tissues in SIV infected non-human primates . We aimed to determine if a similar approach was effective in people living with HIV (PLWH).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Unmodified 3BNC117 was compared with 3BNC117 bound to the chelator MeCOSar and <sup>64</sup>Cu (<sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117<italic>) in vitro</italic> to assess binding and neutralization. In a clinical trial <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 was infused into HIV uninfected (Group 1), HIV infected and viremic (viral load, VL &gt;1000 c/mL; Group 2) and HIV infected aviremic (VL &lt;20 c/mL; Group 3) participants using two dosing strategies: high protein (3mg/kg unlabeled 3BNC117 combined with &lt;5mg <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117) and trace (&lt;5mg <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 only). All participants were screened for 3BNC117 sensitivity from virus obtained from viral outgrowth. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/PET and pharmacokinetic assessments (ELISA for serum 3BNC117 concentrations and gamma counting for <sup>64</sup>Cu) were performed 1, 24- and 48-hours post dosing. The trial (clincialtrials.gov NCT03063788) primary endpoint was comparison of PET standard uptake values (SUVs) in regions of interest (e.g lymph node groups and gastrointestinal tract).</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Comparison of unmodified and modified 3BNC117 in vitro demonstrated no difference in HIV binding or neutralisation. 17 individuals were enrolled of which 12 were dosed including Group 1 (n=4, 2 high protein, 2 trace dose), Group 2 (n=6, 2 high protein, 4 trace) and Group 3 (n=2, trace only). HIV+ participants had a mean CD4 of 574 cells/microL and mean age 43 years. There were no drug related adverse effects and no differences in tissue uptake in regions of interest (e.g lymph node gut, pharynx) between the 3 groups. In the high protein dosing group, serum concentrations of 3BNC117 and gamma counts were highly correlated demonstrating that <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 remained intact <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>In PLWH on or off ART, the intervention of infusing <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 and MRI/PET imaging over 48 hours, was unable to detect HIV-1 env expression in vivo. Future studies should investigate alternative radiolabels such as zirconium which have a longer half-life in vivo.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para0013">Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality for people living with HIV (PLWH), however treatment is needed lifelong. The major barrier to a cure for HIV is long lived and proliferating latently infected CD4+ T-cells [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which are highly enriched in lymph node (LN) tissue and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A major challenge to understanding where and how HIV persists on ART in tissues, is the difficulty in using tissue biopsies which are invasive, expensive and only assess a tiny fraction of an organ <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0014">The number of latently infected cells is almost ten times higher in tissues such as the GI tract or LN where drug concentrations of antiretrovirals have been shown to be lower than in blood [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, detection of constitutive and inducible expression of viral protein in PLWH on ART, not just viral RNA or DNA <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, has significant implications for the efficacy of therapeutic interventions such as broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAb), which can target and potentially eliminate infected cells that express viral protein. Hence bNAbs and other therapeutic vaccines are being actively pursued as cure strategies <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Developing a safe non-invasive method to locate and quantify HIV protein in tissue will be a critical tool to understand and eventually eliminate HIV persistence on ART.</p>
              <p id="para0015">Diagnostic imaging using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with antibodies radiolabelled with a positron-emitting radionuclide can be used to quantitate biodistribution and localisation of antibodies. This approach is now extensively used in oncology and isotopes for various elements have been used, including iodine, indium, zirconium and copper. The high molecular weight of IgG antibodies (150 kDa) and their interaction with the Fc-receptor means that they may take days to clear from the blood-pool and accumulate in target tissues. The positron-emitting radionuclide copper 64 (<sup>64</sup>Cu) has a positron emission energy that is similar to fluorine-18 but has a longer radioactive half-life of 12.7 hours which allows for PET imaging up to 48 hours after injection. Copper-64 has also been safely applied in humans to quantify the distribution of various cancers [<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and allows for low effective doses of radiation which are required to study healthy volunteers.</p>
              <p id="para0016">PET imaging has also been used to detect simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in non-human primates (NHP) before and after suppressive ART <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In that study, a broadly neutralising antibody against the SIV envelope protein 7D3 was labelled with copper-64, and then PET/CT imaging was performed to detect SIV envelope protein in tissue. In NHP off ART, there was increased uptake of the radiolabelled antibody in the GI tract, genital tract and axillary and inguinal LNs. In animals on ART with an undetectable viral load in plasma, there was uptake of the antibody in tissue including colon, spleen, the male genital tract and LNs. Uptake of radiolabelled antibody was clearly different from uninfected NHP and the distribution was consistent with other markers of virus persistence, including measurement of SIV DNA and RNA. Whether a similar approach can be used in PLWH remains unknown.</p>
              <p id="para0017">3BNC117 is a potent bNAb that targets the CD4-binding site and has been demonstrated to neutralise 195 of 237 HIV strains across 6 clades <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In clinical trials it has been administered to PLWH both on and off ART with a single infusion of 3BNC117 resulted in a 2 log<sub>10</sub> reduction in plasma HIV RNA in viremic individuals <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In aviremic individuals on ART, infusions of 3BNC117 alone resulted in prolonged time to viral rebound after ceasing ART consistent with neutralisation of free virus and potential depletion of infected cells [<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="para0018">Here we report the results of a clinical trial that infused <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 into HIV-uninfected participants and HIV-infected participants on and off ART with serial PET/MRI scans. The objectives of this trial were to determine (i) if modifying 3BNC117 would impact its ability to bind and neutralize HIV, (ii) the safety of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117, and (iii) the <italic>in vivo</italic> distribution of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 in PLWH as compared to uninfected controls. We also compared dosing with labelled antibody alone or a combination of labelled and unlabelled antibody, to permit evaluation of all tissue types and whether they could impact the assessment of the distribution of HIV infected cells.</p>

                <p id="para0019">This was an open-label phase I clinical trial to assess <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 for its safety and potential to detect tissue sites of HIV in HIV-uninfected individuals and HIV-infected individuals on and off ART.</p>
                <p id="para0020">Study participants were enrolled in three cohorts, HIV-uninfected controls, HIV-infected viremic participants off ART and HIV-infected aviremic participants receiving ART. Participants undertook five visits over a 14-day period plus a screening visit. Eligible subjects received an infusion of 3mg/kg 3BNC117 bound to no more than 80 MBq of <sup>64</sup>Cu which combines the small amount of labelled antibody (&lt; 5 mg <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117) with the remainder of the unlabeled antibody in a single infusion at the baseline visit (Day 0). The labelled and unlabelled antibody were combined in a 250 mL bag of normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) which was infused intravenously over 60 minutes via an intravenous line containing a 0.22 micron filter. During the course of the trial the design was amended, and subsequent participants received only the labelled antibody dosed as; up to 5 mg of 3BNC117 bound to 120-130 MBq of <sup>64</sup>Cu. This trace dosing was prepared in a 5 mL syringe and infused via slow push over 5 minutes. The amended dose of <sup>64</sup>Cu was increased after detailed dosimetry on the first participants demonstrated that 130 MBq of <sup>64</sup>Cu could be administered and stay under the approved effective dose of 4.7 mSv. Planned recruitment was for 2 HIV uninfected individuals and 4 HIV infected individuals per group.

                <title>Preparation of MeCOSar-3BNC117 and radiolabeling with <sup>64</sup>Cu</title>
                <p id="para0021">NHS-MeCOSar was dissolved in DMSO, mixed with 3BNC117 in PBS at 4 different molar ratios (5x, 10x, 15x, 20x NHS-MeCOSar to GMP-3BNC117) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction was purified via spin column (10kDa MWCO), washed twice with 0.1M ammonium acetate in saline (pH 5.8), sterile filtered and aliquoted at a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. SEC was used to monitor the stability of GMP-3BNC117 and the different MeCOSar-3BNC117 constructs. LC-MS was used to assess changes in molecular weight associated with addition of MeCOSar.</p>
                <p id="para0022">Radiolabeling was achieved by incubating copper-64 (370 MBq) with MeCOSar-3BNC117 (4 mg) at room temperature for 15 minutes. The crude reaction mixture was purified via centrifugal filtration (50kDa MWCO), washed twice with saline, reconstituted in saline containing 5% human serum albumin (HAS) and sterile filtered using a 0.22 micron filter. Radiochemical purity was determined by instant thin-layer chromatography (iTLC) using 10 mM EDTA in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7) as a mobile phase. Protein integrity of the radiolabeled construct was monitored via size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC). Stability of [<sup>64</sup>Cu]Cu-MeCOSar-3BNC117 was assessed in human serum at 37⁰C over 48 hours.</p>

The assay for the fully radiolabeled construct was also developed so it could be used as a validation assay when study drug radiolabeling was performed during the clinical trialr</p>
                <p id="para0024">1) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. 50 ng HIV AD8 gp140 antigen combined with 10x coating buffer (200mM TrisHCl and 1M NaCl in Milli-Q [MQ] water) was coated on Immuno Maxisorp 96 well microplates. Each well was washed with phosphate buffered saline supplemented with Tween 20 (PBST) then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Plates were then sealed and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours, shaking at 300 rpm. Serial dilutions of GMP-3BNC117, MeCOSar-3BNC117, <sup>64</sup>Cu-MeCOSar-3BNC117, or isotype control from 1ug/mL to 7.8 ng/mL were added to microplates with 5% BSA used as a negative control with plates incubated at room temperature for 2 hours, shaking at 300 rpm. 100uL of a secondary horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-Fc antibody used at a dilution of 1:1000 was added to each well then incubated for 1 hour, shaking at 300 rpm. Wells were washed 6x in 200uL PBST, then dried. 100uL of chromogenic TMB substrate was added to each well, incubated for 15-20 minutes then the reaction was stopped with 1M Sulfuric Acid in MQ water. Absorbance at 450 nm was assessed by a light reader</p>
                <p id="para0025">2) Cell binding assay. Binding of 3BNC117 to cell surface expressed Env was performed as previously described <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Briefly, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T) cells were transfected with Env expression plasmids for HIV strains AD8 and NL4.3 using lipofectamine 2000. 24h post transfection the cells were incubated with 10µg/mL 3BNC117, MeCOSar-3BNC117 or serum from a HIV+ viremic individual (HIVIG), followed by incubation with a FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human F(ab’)2 Ig (Chemicon). FITC expression was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) which corresponds to the level of 3BNC117 binding to Env transfected cells and the relative fluorescence was calculated as previously described <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
                <p id="para0026">3) Neutralisation assay. Env pseudotyped luciferase reporter viruses were produced and titrated in JC53 cells as previously described <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Reporter viruses pseudotyped with subtype B Env strains with high (NL4.3 and AD8) and moderate sensitivity (TRO.11) to neutralising antibodies were produced <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These reporter viruses were incubated in increasing concentrations of 3BNC117 and MeCOSar-3BNC117 (0.0032µg/mL to 10µg/mL) for 1 hour at 37°C. The virus and antibody mixture were then added to JC53 cells and incubated at 37°C for a total of 72 hours. The level of reporter virus entry was measured by luciferase activity in cell lysates (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured using a FLUOStar microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Virus entry in wells containing antibody was normalized to that of wells incubated with PBS. Inhibition curves were generated with a non-linear function and least squares analysis in Prism (Graphpad). The IC<sub>50</sub> was determined from these curves.</p>

In general, the viremic individuals were screened using a CD8-depleted lymphoblast VOA, as described previously <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Briefly, participant CD4+ T-cells were stimulated for 24 hrs with PHA (1ug/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a minimum of six replicate wells of 1.5-3 million cells, followed by co-culture with CD8-depleted lymphoblasts (lymphoblasts were CD8-depleted using the CD8 MicroBeads, Human kit, Miltenyi Biotec). The CD8-depleted lymphoblasts were added in a 1:1 ratio with the CD4+ T-cells.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0061">We report the findings from the first PET/MRI imaging clinical trial of radiolabelled antibodies administered to healthy controls and PLWH. Injection of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 followed by serial imaging over 48 hours in HIV-infected and uninfected participants was safe, and no drug related adverse events were observed. We demonstrated pre-clinical data that modified 3BNC117 was able to bind and neutralize HIV envelope with similar efficiency to 3BNC117 and that radiolabeling of MeCOSar-3BNC117 with copper-64 was possible at room temperature in just 15 minutes to give <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 in very high radiochemical yields. <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 showed similar biodistribution and pharmacokinetics between controls, viremic and aviremic HIV-infected participants, when administered at a tracer dose (&lt; 5 mg injected) and when co-administered with supplemental naked 3BNC117 at 3mg/kg dose levels. No uptake of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 in previously reported HIV reservoirs such as lymphoid tissue or GI tract were seen.</p>
              <p id="para0062">There were several key and important differences between this human clinical trial and the prior published non-human primate study <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Firstly, the anti-SIV broadly neutralising antibody 7D3 was a murine IgG while 3BNC117 is a human IgG. In humans and macaques, murine IgG is immunogenic with the production of anti-murine antibodies and has a shorter half-life reported down to one day in humans <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Secondly, the NHP study used a pegylated antibody to prolong its half-life and decrease the potential adverse immune reactions to the murine antibodies. The differences in pharmacokinetics and target of 7D3 compared to 3BNC117 may have impacted on the timing of visualization of HIV envelope in tissues by imaging, which could explain the lack of uptake of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 in our study.</p>
              <p id="para0063">We addressed the possibility of differences in protein dose impacting on biodistribution of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 by utilizing two different dosing strategies, tracer dosing as in the prior NHP trial, and tracer dosing combined with unlabelled antibody (3mg/kg) which would address any possible impact of a peripheral tissue "sink" and to facilitate binding to HIV targets <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The lack of difference in biodistribution between the two dose levels indicates that the temporal course of uptake of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 may be a factor in assessing HIV envelope expression in tissue, and imaging at longer time points may be beneficial. We also observed a shorter metabolic half-life of 3BNC117 compared to the prior phase I study <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, however we only sampled blood for 48 hours post infusion which will underestimate the terminal half-life clearance, and our Cmax levels and initial clearance curves are highly comparable to the prior study <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0064">The expression of HIV envelope <italic>in vivo</italic>, even in viremic individuals is likely lower than in SIV-infected NHP or when imaging tumor antigens in oncology. In HIV infection, expression of HIV env has been reported at approximately 10 envelope trimers expressed per HIV virion. In contrast, in SIV infection, expression of SIV env per SIV virion is up to ten times higher [<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p id="para0065">This relative lack of antigen target in HIV compared to SIV infection and also in oncology studies where typically 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> membrane associated protein targets exist per cell <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> may explain why we were unable to detect HIV env expression <italic>in vivo</italic> in this study. This difference needs to be an important consideration when considering future technologies to image HIV. It should be noted that this imaging technique aims to detect HIV envelope on infected cells and not cell free virus. Other contributing factors include the fact that SIV infection typically generates higher viral loads and increased doses of radioactivity can be given in a NHP study. For example the five viremic macaques imaged by Santangelo et al had a mean weight and viral load of 7.6kg and 570860 copies/mL, respectively and received 81 MBq of copper-64 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This compares to our viremic participants who received tracer dosing in this trial who had a mean weight and viral load of 89.8 kg and 115483 copies/mL, respectively and received 129 MBq of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117. Infusion of a moderately increased dose of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 could have been offset by the fact that the macaques were over 10 times smaller with higher viral loads compared to the HIV-infected participants imaged in this study.</p>
              <p id="para0066">Our study had several limitations. First, we enrolled a relatively small sample size as this was an early phase trial that may have meant a very low specific signal could have been missed. However, given we examined two different dosing strategies in six participants with clear viremia, it is unlikely that a positive imaging signal was missed. We also only employed the trace dosing strategy in the aviremic group based on our findings from uninfected and viremic cohorts, so cannot draw any conclusions about imaging with 3mg/kg dosing for aviremic individuals. We used a copper-64 radioisotope with a 12-hour half-life, to allow for imaging over the first 48 hours of dosing and an effective radiation dose below 5 mSv, which is required when recruiting uninfected controls in the Australian regulatory environment. The half-life of 3BNC117 is approximately nine days in viremic individuals and 17 days in uninfected individuals <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore the 48-hour imaging window in this trial allowed for accurate assessment of the initial distribution and equilibrium phase of the antibody. However, if data beyond this timepoint is required to image the uptake of antibody into tissues this was not able to be captured using <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117. It is possible that we didn't detect HIV envelope due to competition from endogenous antibody with the labeled antibody potentially blocking binding to HIV envelope on infected cells. This could be evaluated using pseudotyped virus to infect cells in the presence and absence of labeled 3BNC117 and patient sera and quantification of binding of the antibody using flow cytometry, as previously described <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. An experiment such as this could identify if endogenous antibodies were able interfere with binding of radiolabeled 3BNC117 to infected cells <italic>in vivo.</italic> However, we think that this possible explanation is unlikely given the clear binding of labeled anti-env antibody observed in prior studies of SHIV-infected non-human primates.</p>
              <p id="para0067">Although we were unable to detect HIV envelope expression in this study, alternative imaging strategies should be evaluated. One approach could be studies with alternate non-human primate models using chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) that carry envelope derived from HIV and an appropriate labelled antibody targeting this Env. Other clinical trials could include radiolabeling with a positron-emitting radionuclide with a longer radioactive half-life (e.g. zirconium-89, t<sub>1/2</sub> = 79 h) that would allow PET images to be acquired several days post infusion and may allow temporal changes in uptake and improved blood pool clearance to be assessed. Other potential strategies include increasing the available target by combining more than one broadly neutralising antibody that target different sites on envelope, for example combining an antibody such as 3BNC117 that targets the CD4 binding site with an antibody targeting the V3 loop allowing for close to 100% coverage of HIV quasispecies within an individual. Alternatively, use of a latency reversal agent that could increase expression of HIV proteins or performing the imaging procedures soon after ART interruption are possible strategies that may optimise this technique to image the distribution of HIV.</p>
              <p id="para0068">Although the administration of <sup>64</sup>Cu-3BNC117 did not demonstrate a difference between uninfected and infected participants, the radiolabeled antibody was safe and, further clinical trials of imaging techniques are warranted.</p>
