                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Globally, household air pollution (HAP) is a leading environmental cause of morbidity and mortality. Our trial aims to assess the impact of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking to reduce household air pollution exposure on child health outcomes, compared to usual cooking practices in Bangladesh. The primary aim is to evaluate if reduced exposure to HAP through the provision of LPG for cooking from early gestation through to age 2 improves child anthropometry, health, and neuro-cognitive developmental outcomes, compared to children exposed to emissions from usual practice.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Two-arm parallel cluster randomized controlled trial (cCRT). We will extend the intervention and follow-up of our existing “Poriborton” trial. In a subset of the original surviving participants, we will supply LPG cylinders and LPG stoves (intervention) compared to usual cooking practices and extend the follow-up to 24 months of age. The expected final sample size, for both (intervention and control) is 1854 children with follow-up to 2 years of age available for analysis.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This trial will answer important research gaps related to HAP and child health and neuro-cognitive developmental outcomes. This evidence will help to understand the impact of a HAP intervention on child health to inform policies for the adoption of clean fuel in Bangladesh and other similar settings.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par13">Globally, household air pollution (HAP) is one of the leading environmental causes of death and adverse health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HAP consists of emissions from burning solid fuels for cooking or heating that contain toxic respirable particles, including particulate matter (PM2.5, &lt; 2.5 μm in diameter, and PM10 &lt; 10 μm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately 3.8 billion people or 49% of the world’s population, mostly poor people from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), are still exposed to HAP from the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating, contributing to over 4 million premature deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Measurement of PM2.5 in households using solid fuels is at least 10 to 50 times in excess of the safe levels set by the WHO. Women and children are particularly at risk due to a combination of their higher vulnerability and chronic levels of exposure due to the gendered division of labor and domestic responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The use of inefficient stoves in poorly ventilated areas and long hours cooking and heating cause exposure to HAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Children under the age of five are more likely to be exposed to HAP, staying close to their mothers near the domestic hearth.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Over 149 million children under five suffered from stunting in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and HAP is considered to account for a large proportion of stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Stunting is defined as height-for-age 2 standard deviations below the growth standards, and stunted children have both physical and cognitive developmental delays. Few studies examine the biological pathways by which HAP causes stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It may be through the same pathway that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke reduces birth weight, thus contributing to stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], or through acute respiratory infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], or anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], all of which are associated with stunting. During the antenatal period, exposure to air pollution may induce oxidative stress or systematic inflammation that occurs, as a result, may be a pathway to growth retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Exposure to air pollution during the postnatal period may promote stunting via impairments in the immune system and development, clinical and subclinical infections, changes in nutrition (dietary intake and metabolism), and altered bone metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The epidemiological evidence is from retrospective observational studies. A recent review of solid fuel use on stunting ascertained that those children living in homes that used solid fuels as the primary fuel source were three times more likely to be severely stunted compared to those in households using cleaner fuel, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a population-based study in India, children exposed to solid fuel compared to those unexposed had differences in mean height-for-age <italic>z</italic>-scores of 0.61, a 21.3% difference after accounting for confounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Further research from India revealed households using clean cooking fuels had reduced the likelihood of stunting after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there have been no randomized controlled trials of HAP interventions and stunting, which this study aims to address.</p>
                <p id="Par15">HAP is a recognized lung health hazard, and early life exposure determines the lung function trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The underlying cause of many acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) deaths in children may be due to immature respiratory and immune systems and exposure to inefficient burning of solid fuels in households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Infants exposed to HAP experience ALRI’s in early life and are associated with reduced lung function and the persistence of respiratory symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Children living in households using solid fuel for cooking are far more as likely to develop ALRI compared to children in households using clean fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This suggests that early intervention is critical to improve lung health.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Evidence of the effect on child development and specifically on neuro-developmental delays from ambient air pollution literature has been accumulating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In a review of air pollution and cognitive outcomes, four included studies examined in utero exposure and follow-up ≤ 5 years of age, and eight studies examined postnatal exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Pollution resulted in delays in motor, language and social skills at ages 6 and 18 months, and the postnatal exposure studies found effects mostly in boys. The studies were heterogeneous (design, population, source/type of exposure, follow-up), and all were observational. PM2.5 was specifically implicated in children aged 15 months; with every 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, there were significant decreases in the mental score of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (<italic>β</italic> = − 0.39 with PM2.5 exposure) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par17">To our knowledge, Poriborton is the largest trial specifically investigating reduced exposure to HAP and perinatal outcomes. This extension of Poriborton will make it one of the longest intervention and follow-up periods of the trials in this field. It specifically addresses identified research priorities related to HAP, including investigating the risk of severe infection, child growth, and cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This trial will help to understand the impact of a HAP intervention on child health using existing research infrastructure and produce high-quality evidence.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par18">The primary aim is to evaluate if reduced exposure to HAP through the provision of LPG for cooking from early gestation through to age 2 improves child growth, respiratory illness, and neuro-cognitive developmental outcomes. Specifically, we aim to evaluate if reduced exposure to HAP to age 2 reduces stunting by 20% (28% in intervention and 35% control), significantly reduces the prevalence and severity of acute lower respiratory infections, improves child development by 0.3 SD at 24 months of age, and is a cost-effective intervention to deliver to the community considering the return to investment.</p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par19">The study design is a two-arm cluster randomized controlled superiority trial (cRCT). We will use the existing trial infrastructure of Poriborton trial, which provided LPG cylinders and LPG stoves from early pregnancy until birth, and the control arm continued usual cooking practices. The usual cooking practice in this setting is a traditional clay stove with various biomass fuels. For further details, see the Poriborton trial protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We will use the existing trial infrastructure of Poriborton and seamlessly continue the LPG cylinder provision (intervention), extending the follow-up to 24 months of child’s age in the intervention arm. The intervention of the extension will commence around the time of birth (once the most recent cylinder needs replacing but not before seven completed days post-partum), and hence, we will have uninterrupted LPG coverage up to 2 years of age.</p>

The Sherpur district is located approximately 200 km north of Dhaka and has been chosen based on the high neonatal mortality rates and the low saturation of the use of LPG fuel for cooking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Sherpur has a population of ~ 1,170,219 living in rural areas that are divided into five sub-districts. Of these five sub-districts, we have purposively selected two for the study based on the road conditions that allow a good vehicular access with the district headquarters for the transportation of LPG cylinders as well as field team access.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Sherpur, the Poriborton study site, in Northern Bangladesh, divided by Unions (main picture).

Inclusion criteria for this extension part of the trial were mother-child dyads from the Poriborton trial cohort who gave birth to a liveborn infant and who was still alive on or after 15 June 2021 and who gave consent and were willing to continue to participate in the study up to 24 months of the child’s age. Exclusion criteria are women who had a pregnancy loss or stillbirth, the child died before the 15th of June or a livebirth, but the child died before the enrollment visit was made. In case of multiple live births from a pregnancy, all children will be enrolled if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p>

                  <p id="Par25">The LPG fuel intervention for this extension will commence around birth when the previous cylinder is almost empty. Gas replenishment will continue free of cost until the infant is 24 months old. We have an existing LPG fuel distribution system in operation built into our electronic data collection system. We will continue with the same distribution process with this application. A national gas distribution company will supply the LPG with Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution certification for cylinder quality. Based on the average duration of use of a cylinder by an average-sized household, we will require approximately 24 refills for each participant until the child is 24 months of age.</p>
                  <p id="Par26">The intervention is distributed at the individual level but randomized at the cluster level to reduce community tensions and overall exposure and leverage community-level adoption of clean cooking. We will conduct outcome assessments at the individual level. Allocation concealment is impractical due to the cluster design and nature of the intervention. Participants and their households receive the intervention based on their cluster of residence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of Poriborton and Poriborton-Extension</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6342_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                  <p id="Par27">Our field implementation team is trained in technical issues for gas stove installation, troubleshooting and maintenance, and cylinder replacement. They will continue to provide support to intervention households who require external assistance as necessary. These stoves will adhere to the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution requirements. We will replace the stoves in case of mechanical faults during the 2 years of use. Control women will continue with usual cooking practices (mostly traditional cooking) and will be followed up for outcome evaluation up to 24 months of child’s age. Participants from the control arm will be provided 200 Taka as time compensation during the six visits (3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months of child’s age).</p>

We anticipate minimal risk to the participants from the study interventions. The quality of gas and stoves are ensured according to the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution standards. To avoid rare accident events from LPG stove, extensive counseling and guidance on safety precautions are provided to intervention participants before installing the stove and every 2 months throughout the intervention.</p>

                  <p id="Par34">In the first year of this five-year study, we will recruit mother-child dyads from Poriborton close to the birth to ensure the continuation of LPG supply in the intervention arm. We commenced recruitment in 2021, and it will take up to 3 years for the whole cohort of children to reach 24 months of age to complete follow-up. Data cleaning and preliminary analysis will be substantial and will require a year. Field activities will wind down in year 4. Final analyses and manuscript preparation will be moved to Sydney in year 5.</p>

                  <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                  <p id="Par35">We expect the final sample size to be at least 1854 children (927 in each arm) with follow-up up to 24 months of child’s age available for analysis. This assumes ten per cent loss-to-follow-up due to mortality in the first 2 years of age (3%), migration out (3%), and withdrawals (2%). For this sample size, we have at least 88% power to detect a 20% lower risk (relative risk =0.8) in stunting, assuming 35% stunting in the control vs 28% in the intervention, an intraclass cluster correlation of 0.02, which is based on the previous cRCT on stunting, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and a two-sided significance level of 0.05. If the intraclass correlation is twice as large, i.e., intraclass correlation 0.04, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], we would still have 80% power. For the secondary outcomes, the final sample size will provide at least 80% power to detect moderate effect sizes for many, if not all, secondary outcomes. For example, we will have 90% power to detect a standardized difference of 0.2 between arms for height-for-age <italic>z</italic>-score. Any differences in perinatal outcomes from Poriborton will not impact the integrity of the extension. We expect reduced perinatal mortality and higher birth weights. Additional live births will result in a slightly higher sample size in the intervention arm for the extension. We investigated this scenario in our power calculation and found the differences in cluster size will remain relatively small and less likely to impact the power.</p>
                  <p id="Par36">For the personal exposure of household air pollution, a sample size of 120 children from each arm will be used to estimate reductions in PM2.5. This sample size will allow us to detect a 28% difference (50% and 70% in intervention and control, respectively) (WHO target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]) with &gt; 80% power.</p>
                  <p id="Par37">The expected number of live births (&gt; 7 days old) eligible is 2154, corresponding to all women enrolled in Poriborton from October 2020, of which we expect 10% fetal loss and up to 5% lost-to-follow-up due to migration (3%) or withdrawal (2%). Of the 2154 births (infants), we expect 2060 to be enrolled into the Poriborton-Extension, conservatively assuming that 4% of the newborns die prior to enrollment or decline to participate in the extension.</p>

This trial will make a major contribution to the evidence of the effect of household air pollution exposure on these child health outcomes at age 2. As this is an extension of an existing trial that originally recruited women in early pregnancy, we will be able to assess the effect of reduced exposure during fetal development compared to those children who were exposed during development, through to age 2.</p>
              <p id="Par73">The strengths of this trial include the high-quality cluster randomized controlled design, the existing trial infrastructure including the field processes and procedures that are already established and tested, and the long-term follow-up of the study. Importantly we have developed excellent community relationships, and the community is very supportive of the trial and the continuation of the trial intervention. Before we applied for funding in late 2019, the community was suggesting to our field staff that we should continue the intervention as they thought that it would be even more important to assess the impact on the health on the infant. We are very pleased to conduct a study for whom the intended beneficiaries are supportive.</p>

The submission of our protocol was as fast as we could considering the very tight timeline between grant award, study population eligibility and finalizing the protocol. We anticipate recruitment to be completed by approximately end of January 2022, and it was completed in February 2022—after submission of this protocol.</p>
