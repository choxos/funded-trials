                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Consistent evidence shows pathology services are overused worldwide and that about one-third of testing is unnecessary. Audit and feedback (AF) is effective for improving care but few trials evaluating AF to reduce pathology test requesting in primary care have been conducted. The aim of this trial is to estimate the effectiveness of AF for reducing requests for commonly overused pathology test combinations by high-requesting Australian general practitioners (GPs) compared with no intervention control. A secondary aim is to evaluate which forms of AF are most effective.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a factorial cluster randomised trial conducted in Australian general practice. It uses routinely collected Medicare Benefits Schedule data to identify the study population, apply eligibility criteria, generate the interventions and analyse outcomes. On 12 May 2022, all eligible GPs were simultaneously randomised to either no intervention control or to one of eight intervention groups. GPs allocated to an intervention group received individualised AF on their rate of requesting of pathology test combinations compared with their GP peers. Three separate elements of the AF intervention will be evaluated when outcome data become available on 11 August 2023: (1) invitation to participate in continuing professional development-accredited education on appropriate pathology requesting, (2) provision of cost information on pathology test combinations and (3) format of feedback. The primary outcome is the overall rate of requesting of any of the displayed combinations of pathology tests of GPs over 6 months following intervention delivery. With 3371 clusters, assuming no interaction and similar effects for each intervention, we anticipate over 95% power to detect a difference of 4.4 requests in the mean rate of pathology test combination requests between the control and intervention groups.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Consistent evidence suggests there is overuse of pathology services worldwide and that approximately 30% of testing is unnecessary.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Australia, the volume and cost of pathology services has increased dramatically over the last decade, with over 150 million pathology services costing Medicare US$3.6 billion in 2020–2021 alone, with the majority of requests made in general practice.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> On top of the increased costs and time spent by practitioners, patients and laboratory staff, unnecessary pathology testing increases the likelihood of false positive results which can lead to unnecessary additional tests, incorrect diagnoses and unnecessary treatment with associated risk of patient harm.</p>
              <p>Audit and feedback, which involves the provision of clinical performance data to healthcare providers with the aim of improving quality of care,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> represents a potentially low cost, scalable and sustainable intervention for reducing overuse of pathology services. To our knowledge, only three randomised trials have evaluated audit and feedback interventions for reducing overuse of pathology test requesting by general practitioners (GPs) with mixed effects.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref></p>
              <p>Baker <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> found providing practice level (and, where available, individualised) audit and feedback on requesting of five pathology tests (thyroid function tests (TFTs), rheumatoid factor, urine culture, serum lipids and viscosity) at 3-month intervals over 12 months accompanied by guidelines to GPs in 33 practices in the UK did not significantly alter test requesting compared with control.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, Verstappen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> showed a multicomponent intervention comprising individualised peer comparison audit and feedback on pathology requesting for various conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, upper and lower abdominal complaints, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, fatigue, degenerative joint complaints) provided to GPs from 26 practices in the Netherlands at 2-month intervals over 6 months, accompanied by guidelines and three face-to-face small group meetings focused on identifying barriers to change and developing action plans, led to a 9% relative reduction in the total number of tests requested per practitioner over 6 months compared with control.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Thomas <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> showed providing practice-level audit and feedback on the requesting rates of nine pathology tests (autoantibody screen, carbohydrate antigen-125, carcino embryonic antigen, ferritin, follicle-stimulating hormone, <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> serum, IgE, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) by GPs from 85 practices in Scotland at 3-month intervals over 12 months, accompanied by brief educational reminder messages added to pathology test result reports, led to a 22% relative reduction in request rates compared with control.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Audit and feedback alone led to greater reductions in request rates compared with reminders alone although the model-based analyses suggested similar effects (OR for feedback=0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94, OR for reminders=0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.93).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>While the latter two studies report benefit with audit and feedback, the approaches are resource intensive (ie, feedback provided on multiple occasions, accompanied by small group educational meetings/reminder messages on targeted test reports) and may not be feasible to implement at scale in many jurisdictions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6</xref></p>
              <p>The current study builds on our previous successful factorial cluster randomised controlled trial of audit and feedback on musculoskeletal diagnostic imaging in Australian general practice.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It showed individualised audit and feedback provided to GPs known to request musculoskeletal imaging at much higher rates than their peers significantly decreased their requesting rate over 12 months compared with no intervention. It also showed 2 rounds of feedback (vs 1) and an enhanced visual display directing GPs attention to ordering rates greater than 80% of peer rates (vs standard display) led to further modest statistically significant reductions in request rates.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of this trial is to estimate the effectiveness of individualised audit and feedback for reducing overall requests for 10 commonly overused combinations of pathology tests by high-requesting GPs in Australia compared with no intervention control. This includes requests for any combination of two or three pathology tests for iron studies, TSH, TFT, vitamin D and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. A secondary objective is to evaluate which forms of audit and feedback are most effective in reducing requests for the pathology test combinations and to estimate their effects.</p>

On 12 May 2022, clusters of general practices based on geographical location with at least one GP who was in the top 10% of requesters for 10 targeted combinations of pathology tests and for at least 2 of the individual pathology test combinations within the 24-month period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2021, were simultaneously randomised either to no intervention control or to 1 of 8 individualised written audit and feedback intervention groups.</p>
                <p>Within those allocated to audit and feedback, GPs were first randomly allocated to receive an invitation to continuing professional development (CPD)-accredited education (yes vs no) (factor 1), then provision of cost information about pathology test combinations (yes vs no) (factor 2) and then feedback format (pamphlet vs letter) (factor 3).</p>

                  <title>Inclusion criteria</title>
                  <p>We included GPs practising in Australia who were (1) in the top 10% of GP referrers for the 10 targeted combinations of pathology tests overall and (2) in the top 10% of GP referrers for at least two of the individual pathology test combinations within the 24-month period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2021. The 10 targeted combinations of pathology tests are: (1) iron studies, TSH and vitamin D, (2) iron studies, vitamin D and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (3) iron studies, TSH and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (4) iron studies, TFT and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (5) iron studies, TFT and vitamin D, (6) TSH, vitamin D and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (7) iron studies and vitamin D, (8) iron studies and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (9) iron studies and TFT and (10) TSH and vitamin D. These pathology test combinations were selected for inclusion in the trial in consultation with stakeholders and the Department of Health and Aged Care and reflect commonly overused combinations of pathology tests in Australian general practice. Only pathology tests which originated with a GP request, were rendered by a pathologist and were claimed from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) (ie, cost covered by the public health system) were included. Pathology tests that were initiated by a pathologist or were not claimed on the MBS were not considered. Under the MBS, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> may be requested as a serum (MBS item 66838) or quantification (MBS item 66839). While GPs may request either of these MBS items, pathologists can choose which item to use based on their professional judgement. As such, a request for either vitamin B<sub>12</sub> item was coded as a request for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> for the purposes of this trial.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>GPs were allocated to a no intervention control group or one of eight intervention groups.</p>
                <p>GPs allocated to an intervention group received individualised written audit and feedback on their requesting of pathology test combinations from the Chief Medical Officer of Australia. The targeted combinations of pathology tests are: (1) iron studies, TSH and vitamin D, (2) iron studies, vitamin D and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (3) iron studies, TSH and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (4) iron studies, TFT and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (5) iron studies, TFT and vitamin D, (6) TSH, vitamin D and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (7) iron studies and vitamin D, (8) iron studies and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, (9) iron studies and TFT and (10) TSH and vitamin D.</p>
                <p>The feedback was delivered by postal mail and presented the recipients’ rate of requesting of a minimum of two and maximum of three targeted pathology test combinations for which they were above the 90th percentile compared with the median request rate of their GP peers in a similar geographic region, determined using the MMM. It described the benefits of reducing unnecessary pathology testing (eg, reducing the potential for false positive results) and invited recipients to access best practice resources on a website, reflect on their requesting data and limit their future pathology requesting to only those clinical situations where it had a reasonable likelihood of altering patient management. The feedback provided to all intervention groups was consistent in content and length other than three separate elements of the audit and feedback intervention evaluated in the trial: (1) invitation to participate in CPD-accredited education aimed at improving pathology requesting (yes vs no); (2) provision of cost information on pathology test combinations (yes vs no) and (3) format of feedback (pamphlet vs letter) (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental additional file 1</xref>).</p>

A hyperlink to a website containing the individual and cumulative costs of pathology tests was also provided. While cost information was included with requesting data, the design of the feedback emphasised use of clinical guidelines to inform appropriate pathology test requesting. Previous trials have shown that combining information about the cost of laboratory tests with performance feedback to physicians in hospital and outpatient medical settings can reduce request rates, although these studies included small numbers of physicians and clusters.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref></p>

                <p>The following baseline data will also be collected: age, sex, geographical location of primary practice address (metropolitan vs other), state or territory of Australia, years practising as GP, total category 1 patient consultations provided during the baseline period (12 months prior to intervention delivery), total number of requests overall for the displayed pathology test combinations, and rates of pathology test combination requests for primary and secondary outcomes at baseline.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>The main analysis will consist of comparing the overall rate of pathology test combination requests between the control and all eight intervention groups combined. Data will be aggregated at the GP level and analysed using generalised linear regression. The dependent variable for the regression will, therefore, be the individual pathology request rate of each GP.</p>
                <p>The analysis will be performed using multilevel mixed effect generalised linear regression model adjusted for the baseline rate of pathology requests of each GP as well as remoteness and years of practice. To remove skewness and potential heteroscedasticity, we will apply a natural log-transformation to the rate (dependent variable) as well as to the baseline rate included as a covariate. Resulting estimates and CIs will be back transformed to the original scale. Clustering of GPs by area-specific clusters will be accounted for by including a random intercept by statistical area level 1 classification. The effect of the intervention will be estimated as the mean difference in the rate of pathology test combination requests between the intervention and control group together with its 95% CI.</p>
                <p>Using the same regression model, we will also estimate the differential effect of separate elements of the intervention: (1) invitation for CPD-accredited education (yes vs no); (2) provision of cost information on pathology test combinations (yes vs no) and (3) format of feedback (pamphlet vs letter). Bonferroni correction will be used to account for multiplicity. We will also test for an interaction between the three elements of the intervention. A similar approach will be used to analyse the secondary outcomes.</p>
                <p>Additional models with additional baseline covariates will be considered together with a limited number of subgroup analyses to identify potential differences in intervention effects for factors that have been prespecified in the statistical analysis plan.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> We expect the MBS data to capture all services rendered during the study period and will therefore assume no missing data. Analyses will be conducted using R or Stata software.</p>

                <title>Power</title>
                <p>The primary endpoint is the overall rate of requests of any of the displayed pathology test combinations for each GP per 1000 category 1 consultations measured over 6 months from intervention delivery. A total of 5964 GPs from 3371 area-specific clusters were identified as eligible for inclusion in the study. This sample size provides over 95% power to detect a 10% rate reduction (ie, a difference of 4.4 requests per 1000 category 1 consultations) in the mean rate of targeted pathology test combination requests between intervention and control, assuming 8:1 randomisation ratio between intervention and control groups, mean (SD) baseline pathology request rate of 44.4 (17.4), variable cluster size (mean cluster size is 1.7, range 1 to 11), intracluster correlation of 0.2 and a two-sided type-I error rate of 5%.</p>
                <p>This sample size also provides over 85% power to detect a 5% rate reduction (ie, a difference of 2.2 requests per 1000 consultations) in the mean rate of pathology test combination requests between (1) GPs invited to CPD-accredited education versus not, (2) GPs receiving pathology test cost information versus not and (3) GPs receiving pamphlet format vs those receiving letter format, assuming a two-sided type-I error rate of 1.67% to control for multiplicity.</p>
