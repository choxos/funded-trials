              <abstract>
                <p>Using a unique resource of samples from a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study, we identified a novel population of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells whose frequency in the peripheral blood was inversely correlated with parasite burden following <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection. These CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed the multifunctional ectoenzyme CD38 and had unique features that distinguished them from other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Specifically, their phenotype was associated with proliferation, activation and cytotoxic potential as well as significantly impaired production of IFN-γ and other cytokines and reduced basal levels of activated STAT1. A CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population with similar features was identified in healthy uninfected individuals, at lower frequency. CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could be generated <italic>in vitro</italic> from CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation. This is the first report of a population of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with a cytotoxic phenotype and markedly impaired IFN-γ capacity in humans. The expansion of this CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T population following infection and its significant association with reduced blood-stage parasite burden is consistent with an important functional role for these cells in protective immunity to malaria in humans. Their ubiquitous presence in humans suggests that they may have a broad role in host-pathogen defense.</p>

                <p>Malaria is one of the three most deadly infectious disease worldwide, together with tuberculosis and HIV. The exact mechanisms underlying effective immunity to malaria remain largely unknown and there is no reliable immune correlate of protection. Here, we take advantage of a unique experimental human infection model to define the immune response to primary exposure of blood-stage malaria parasites in naïve healthy volunteers at the molecular level. We report that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite levels were inversely correlated to the expansion of a specific subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing the activation molecule CD38 and a very unusual phenotype. Although the expansion of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been described in several viral and bacterial infections, we show for the first time that these cells are associated with a ‘naive-like’ effector phenotype, higher cytolytic potential and a strongly impaired ability to produce IFN-γ and other cytokines. Importantly, this subset of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could be also identified in all healthy volunteers prior to infection, suggesting that these core characteristics of circulating CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are independent of active infection and may play an important role in the immune control of other pathogens.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Malaria is associated with complex multi-factorial immune responses, due in part to the multi-stage life cycle of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. parasite which is targeted by multiple arms of the immune system, and the existence of elaborate host-pathogen interactions and evasion mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The effector cells and immune mediators contributing to protection against the sporozoite, liver, and blood-stages of malaria have been the subject of intense investigation over many years [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but the specific molecular mechanisms and critical effector cells that mediate control of parasite burden remain largely unknown [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been implicated in the control of blood-stage parasitemia in numerous animal models [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; and in humans an association with parasite control has been demonstrated in studies utilizing CHMI [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An important effector function of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is the production of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In blood-stage malaria, IFN-γ has been implicated as the key cytokine driving effective immune responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and circumstantial evidence associates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ with protection against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> blood-stage infection in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing the degranulation marker CD107a have been identified in circulating PBMCs from subjects protected by immunization with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sporozoites under the cover of chloroquine chemoprophylaxis following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>–infected red blood cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cytolytic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have also been described as potent immune effectors in protection against many viral infections, including CMV, Epstein-Barr Virus, Influenza and HIV [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>In humans, recently activated T cells are typically identified <italic>ex vivo</italic> via the upregulation of cell surface glycoproteins such as CD69 or CD38 [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CD69 is one of the earliest molecules detected on the T cell surface following TCR engagement, and CD69 mediated signaling results in a range of cellular responses including proliferation [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. CD38 is expressed on the surface of immature but not mature hematopoietic cells, and is also re-expressed by many immune cells (including CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) after activation [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Circulating T cells expressing CD38 during infection have been associated with a recently activated effector phenotype [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; and antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been shown to express high levels of CD38 and produce IFN-γ in the acute phase of several viral infections including EBV [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], HIV [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and <italic>Influenza</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. CD38 is a multifunctional molecule that acts as an ectoenzyme to catalyze the conversion of NAD<sup>+</sup> to the second-messenger cyclic-ADB-ribose (cADPR) and is considered the major regulator of intracellular and extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The purpose of CD38 signaling in T cell immunity is not fully elucidated, although there is strong evidence that the products of CD38 enzymatic activity (principally cADPR) enhance intracellular calcium mobilization which is required for a multitude of cell functions including lymphocyte proliferation [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and lymphocyte migration [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Signaling through CD38 has also been reported to promote the activation and cytotoxic function of human NK cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Experimental infection models provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the mechanisms underlying the induction of immunity following primary exposure of the human immune system to target pathogens. Here, we utilized a model of controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) of naive healthy volunteers [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] to explore the mechanisms underlying the induction of T-cell-associated immunity in blood-stage malaria. We show that the levels of parasite burden following experimental <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> blood-stage infection inversely correlated with the expansion of a specific subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD38 and characterized by high cytotoxic potential but impaired cytokine production. These cells were also present at lower frequency in healthy uninfected individuals, and could be generated <italic>in vitro</italic> from CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation.</p>

                <p>To determine whether significant changes could be detected in the phenotype of circulating lymphocytes following infection, the frequencies of T cells and B cells expressing the activation markers CD69 or CD38 were measured prior to and seven days post-infection with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. In all volunteers, infection led to a significant increase in the frequency and absolute numbers of CD69<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005839.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). There was a higher frequency of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells but not CD38<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and absolute numbers of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells also increased in the peripheral blood during infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005839.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). In the same volunteers, measurement of the level of parasitemia by qPCR over the first seven days of infection revealed a variation in parasite burden between individuals. Thus, we compared the changes in frequency of CD69<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells during infection with parasite burden, to determine if a certain cell type or phenotype was associated with parasite control. Univariate regression analysis revealed no significant association between the changes in the frequency of CD69<sup>+</sup> T cells or B cells and the parasite burden during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <italic>top panel</italic>). However, an inverse correlation between the frequency of CD38<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells and parasite burden during infection was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <italic>bottom panel</italic>). Multivariate regression analysis with forward selection revealed that the fold change in the frequency of CD38<sup>+</sup> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was the only variable significantly negatively associated with parasite burden (<italic>p</italic> = 7.5E-05). Thus, in malaria-naive volunteers, reduced parasite burden during primary blood-stage <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection was associated with the expansion of a specific subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing the activation marker CD38.</p>

                <p>Effector T cell populations expanding in response to infection or immunization have been shown to express high levels of CD38 and the proliferation marker Ki67 but low levels of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Accordingly, we measured the expression of Ki67 and Bcl2 by flow cytometry within CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells circulating in the healthy volunteers prior to infection, as well as at peak of infection seven days after inoculation. The expression of Ki67 was significantly increased in CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells prior to and during infection (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Additionally, the frequency of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells decreased at 7 days post infection compared to prior to infection in CD38<sup>+</sup> but not in CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Conversely, the expression of the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl2 was significantly reduced in CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells both prior to and at peak infection (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>). In both cell subsets, there was an overall decrease in Bcl2 expression at 7 days post infection compared to prior to infection, but to a greater extent for CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). Thus, CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were associated with a ‘naïve-like’ effector T cell phenotype (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup>Bcl2<sup>low</sup>), and the proportion of cells expressing each marker was significantly affected upon infection within this cell subset.</p>
                <p>As CD38 upregulation has been observed following TCR-signaling of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we reasoned that CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells might have increased activation following TCR <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation compared to CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We assessed the level of activation of the FACS-purified CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via TCR stimulation by measuring their capacity to upregulate CD69 expression after short <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with anti-CD3. Prior to infection, there was no significant increase in CD69 expression following TCR stimulation for both CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g002">Fig 2J and 2K</xref>), although the basal expression of CD69 was higher on CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Post-infection, while both cell types significantly upregulated CD69 expression following TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g002">Fig 2J and 2K</xref>), fold change was significantly higher for CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (average fold change of 13.7 and 1.4 for CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016). However, the higher basal expression of CD69 for CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was maintained. These results suggest that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> blood-stage infection of humans led to an increased level of activation following TCR stimulation in both CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cell subsets, albeit to a greater extent for CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells constitutively express higher levels of CD69 compared to CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>
                <p>A recent report associated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing the degranulation marker CD107a with protection against malaria in sporozoite-immunized volunteers [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and CD38 has been implicated in the cytotoxic activity of NK cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, we examined the cytolytic potential of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by measuring their intracellular expression of perforin and granzyme B by flow cytometry both prior to and at peak infection. The frequency of cells expressing perforin or granzyme B was significantly greater in CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than in CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells prior to and post infection (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.011 prior to infection, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.012 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.017 at peak infection for perforin and granzyme B, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Additionally, the CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contained a higher proportion of cells co-expressing perforin and granzyme B (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.006 prior to and at peak infection, respectively, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The proportion of cells expressing granzyme B and/or perforin within either CD38<sup>+</sup> or CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets did not change markedly during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Eomesodermin (Eomes), a key transcription factor associated with the cytolytic activity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] was expressed at similar levels by CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells prior to infection. However, a trend for an increase in Eomes expression in CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following infection was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset that expands during <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection defines an effector population with cytolytic potential.</p>

                <p>Since the CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population displayed a phenotype associated with recent activation combined with a marked inability to produce cytokines, we next confirmed that the CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were not undergoing apoptosis through an activation-induced cell death mechanism [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

                <p>To determine whether the impaired ability of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to produce IFN-γ and other cytokines was due to a specific defect in cytokine-associated signaling pathways, we investigated the level of phosphorylated STATs within CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells using Phosphoflow [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. STAT1 is mainly phosphorylated through stimulation with type I or type II IFNs [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and a critical role for STAT4 activation by type I IFNs in the IFN-γ response has been reported [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Consistent with this, CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed significantly reduced levels of both pSTAT1 and pSTAT4 compared to CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.031 prior to infection, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002 post-infection for pSTAT1 and pSTAT4, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Unexpectedly, since STAT5 mediates IL-2 signaling in T cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and we found that IL-2 production by CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly reduced compared to CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), the levels of pSTAT5 were similar between CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), suggesting that both cells subsets retain similar capacity to respond to IL-2.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Herein, we identify a novel population of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells displaying cytolytic potential and a phenotype associated with proliferation and activation. Increased frequency of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood of human volunteers inversely correlated with parasite burden in an experimental blood-stage malaria infection model. Importantly, these CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a significantly reduced ability to produce IFN-γ and several other cytokines, and contained reduced basal levels of phosphorylated STAT1, compared to CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population was also present at low frequency in all healthy uninfected individuals we tested. CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with cytolytic potential could be generated <italic>in vitro</italic> from CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following exposure to antigen or mitogen but did not display impaired cytokine expression.</p>
              <p>The CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells we described in this study have features of both naïve and effector T cells, but are distinguished by their strongly impaired cytokine function. These results are in concordance with the previous study of Plebanski <italic>et al</italic>. describing a specific subset of circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD38 and CD45RA but with reduced proliferation and Th1 cytokine production upon TCR stimulation [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, the CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells circulating during infection displayed a phenotype associated with recent activation and cytotoxic potential, suggesting that this cell population may be a subset of cytolytic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We are aware of one early report of cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell generation in a human volunteer following experimental immunization irradiated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sporozoites [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and protection from sporozoite infection conferred by adoptive transfer of cytolytic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones in a rodent model [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Both of those examples utilized the liver-stage of the parasite where the host cells include MHC-II expressing Kupffer cells and hepatocytes and there is solid evidence that cytolytic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can induce death in target cells through MHC-II dependent mechanisms, thereby contributing to protection against pathogens with a tropism for MHC-II expressing cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, since red blood cells lack MHC-II molecules, so the mechanism by which CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could exert their cytotoxic function in blood-stage malaria remains to be elucidated. One possibility is that the cells might be operating through a MHC-independent mechanism, as observed in NK cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Alternatively, the cytolytic CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells might be responsible for MHC-II dependent killing of recently activated antigen presenting cells (APCs) in order to prevent the development of exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can mediate both cytotoxic and suppressor functions <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and that cytolytic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can directly induce apoptosis of activated APCs [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, we speculate that the function of our novel population of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during infection might be to control and restrain the immune response, rather than to promote it.</p>
              <p>Unexpectedly, we found that these CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are very poor producers of IFN-γ in response to mitogenic stimulation, compared to CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This result was surprising because IFN-γ has been implicated as the main effector cytokine produced by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and contributing to protective immunity to blood-stage malaria [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells displaying a cytotoxic function are thought to co-express IFN-γ [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. To our knowledge, our study provides the first evidence of a differential IFN-γ production capability and cytotoxic phenotype between CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in humans, and of a disassociation between cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production.</p>
              <p>Additionally, this CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population had a limited ability to produce other pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17. This reduced capacity of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to produce cytokines does not appear to be due to exhaustion or a form of activation induced cell death since these cells could be activated following TCR stimulation and were negative for Annexin-V. Thus, CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells display a phenotype of functionally active T cells with reduced capacity to produce cytokines, notably IFN-γ. These observations, together with previous studies on regulatory T cells that identified a positive association between CD38 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and immune suppressive activity [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], further support our hypothesis that CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells might have a repressive regulatory function rather than a direct cytotoxic activity against malaria parasites or infected cells.</p>
              <p>The CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed low basal levels of pSTAT1, which is a key transcription factor associated with IFN-γ signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], suggesting that their reduced IFN-γ production might be associated with a defect in STAT1-signalling pathway. We found that the marked reduction in basal levels of phosphorylated STAT1 in CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is not due to a defect in responsiveness to IFN-α or to a capability to phosphorylate STAT1, nor could the differences be accounted for in basal levels of total STAT1 protein. Thus, constitutively lower levels of activated STAT1 within this cell population might explain the reduced expression of activated STAT1 measured <italic>ex vivo</italic> within CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Alternatively, the difference in pSTAT1 basal levels between CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells might be due to differences in cytokine responsiveness other than type I or type II IFNs. Indeed, STAT1 can also be phosphorylated through IL-6, IL-10 and IL-21 [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A more comprehensive cytokine signaling profiling and STAT responsiveness of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in comparison to other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets could address this question.</p>
              <p>CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells retained their cytotoxic function and impaired ability to produce cytokines throughout infection. Although infection led to significant changes in the phenotype of both CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets during infection, there was a marked increase in CD45RA expression and decrease in Ki67 expression within CD38<sup>+</sup> but not CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Hence, we speculate that, upon infection, ‘naïve-like’ CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells proliferate and differentiate into parasite-specific effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are then recruited out of the peripheral blood and into lymphoid organs such as the spleen where they specifically exert their cytotoxic function. Consistent with this is our observation that there were no changes in the cytotoxic phenotype of circulating CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in the volunteers following infection.</p>
              <p>Both the absolute numbers of CD38<sup>+</sup> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and relative frequency of CD38<sup>+</sup> versus CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell were increased upon infection. Thus, the accumulation of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood upon infection is not due to the recruitment of CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets into other body compartments such as lymphoid organs. Increases in frequency of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can originate from the activation of circulating CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells already present in the peripheral blood prior to infection, as suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g007">Fig 7</xref>. Alternatively, newly generated CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells might be originating from other lymphoid organs such as the spleen and found in the peripheral blood as a ‘spillover’ effect. We found that the proportion of CD45RA<sup>+</sup> within CD38<sup>+</sup> but not CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is significantly increased upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005839.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and CD38 has been shown to be preferentially expressed by CD45RA<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and might play a role for lymphocyte homing on those cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells might have differential homing properties, so distinct abilities to migrate between lymphoid organs.</p>
              <p>In contrast to CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that expanded in experimentally infected volunteers, the <italic>in vitro</italic> generated CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were fully capable of producing IFN-γ and other cytokines in response to stimulation. Thus, the reduced ability of CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to produce IFN-γ is a unique feature of CD38<sup>+</sup> cells that arise <italic>in vivo</italic>. Cytokine production by T cells is highly modulated during T cell differentiation, notably through epigenetic modifications [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that <italic>in vivo</italic> the upregulation of CD38 by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is accompanied by epigenetic changes that inhibit the transcription of genes coding for cytokines. Thus, we speculate that the analysis of epigenetic modifications to cytokine promoters in circulating CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the context of natural or experimental infection will inform the molecular mechanisms controlling cytokine production within this cell population.</p>
              <p>Although an increase in frequency of circulating CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been observed following immunization or infection in a number of host-pathogen systems [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the role of those cells has not been elucidated, and impaired cytokine capacity has not been reported. All volunteers in our CHMI study had a pre-existing proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD38 prior to infection, as do all healthy volunteers we have since examined. All CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from healthy volunteers either prior to infection, or during experimental malaria infection, displayed similar features clearly distinguishing them from CD38<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Taken together, these results lead us to speculate that this cell population might also expand during other infections. This could explain the variation observed in the pre-existing proportion of CD38<sup>+</sup> cells among total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells between individuals (ranging from 0.9 to 10.9% of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells), reflecting a more or less recent infection with a pathogen. This idea is also supported by the recent study from Tsang et al, which highlighted that the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD38 was a feature presenting very high inter-individual variability [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we have identified a unique population of circulating CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in humans with characteristics that clearly distinguish them from other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; specifically, markers of recent activation and cytotoxic potential but impaired cytokine production. This CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population was specifically expanded in experimental blood-stage malaria infection and was significantly associated with reduced parasite burden. This is consistent with a critical role for these cells in protective immunity to malaria. Further insights into the function and origin of this cell population might provide novel immune correlates of protection in blood-stage malaria and other infectious diseases, and inform vaccine design.</p>

                <title>Ethics statement</title>
                <p>Experimental infection of malaria-naive healthy adult volunteers was undertaken at QPharm Pty Ltd (Brisbane, Australia) with approval of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Human Research Ethics Committee (QIMRB-HREC) and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). Clinical studies were registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): clinical trial numbers ACTRN12612000814875, ACTRN12613000565741 and ACTRN12613001040752. All subjects were enrolled with written informed consent.</p>

                <p>Inoculum preparation, volunteer recruitment, infection, monitoring and treatment were performed as described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In brief, healthy malaria-naive individuals were intravenously inoculated with 1,800 viable <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasitized erythrocytes, and treated with anti-malarial drugs at seven to eight days post-infection. Blood samples were collected prior to infection and seven days post-infection (before anti-malarial drug treatment). Peripheral blood from healthy volunteers was also collected under informed consent and approval by the QIMRB-HREC. Peripheral blood collected in Lithium Heparin Vacutainers (BD Biosciences) was either used directly for flow cytometry analysis, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated using standard Ficoll density gradient centrifugation.</p>

                <title>Determination of parasite burden in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> experimentally infected volunteers</title>
                <p>Parasitemia levels over the course of the infection were determined using a consensus <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> species-specific quantitative PCR assay from 500 μl of packed red blood cells as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Parasite levels were assessed once daily until day four post-infection and then twice daily until treatment. All samples were batch tested in triplicate together after each study completion. The total parasite burden across the first seven days of infection was defined as the area under the curve of the transformed parasite levels from day 0 to day 7 of infection using the trapezoidal rule. The limit of detection was 64 parasites/500 μl packed red blood cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005839.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p>
