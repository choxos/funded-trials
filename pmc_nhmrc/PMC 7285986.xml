                  <title>Objective:</title>
                  <p>Clinical practice guidelines recommend that community mental health services provide preventive care for clients’ chronic disease risk behaviours; however, such care is often not routinely provided. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of offering clients an additional consultation with a specialist clinician embedded within a community mental health service, in increasing client-reported receipt of, and satisfaction with, preventive care.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="section2-0004867420914741">
                  <title>Method:</title>
                  <p>A randomised controlled trial was undertaken in one Australian community mental health service. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 811) were randomised to receive usual care (preventive care in routine consultations; <italic>n</italic> = 405) or usual care plus the offer of an additional consultation with a specialist preventive care clinician (<italic>n</italic> = 406). Blinded interviewers assessed at baseline and 1-month follow-up the client-reported receipt of preventive care (assessment, advice and referral) for four key risk behaviours individually (smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol overconsumption and physical inactivity) and all applicable risks combined, acceptance of referrals and satisfaction with preventive care received.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="section3-0004867420914741">
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Analyses indicated significantly greater increases in 12 of the 18 preventive care delivery outcomes in the intervention compared to the usual care condition from baseline to follow-up, including assessment for all risks combined (risk ratio = 4.00; 95% confidence interval = [1.57, 10.22]), advice for all applicable risks combined (risk ratio = 2.40; 95% confidence interval = [1.89, 6.47]) and offer of referral to applicable telephone services combined (risk ratio = 20.13; 95% confidence interval = [2.56, 158.04]). For each component of care, there was a significant intervention effect for at least one of the individual risk behaviours. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with preventive care received, ranging from 77% (assessment) to 87% (referral), with no significant differences between conditions.</p>

                <sec id="section4-0004867420914741">
                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>The intervention had a significant effect on the provision of the majority of recommended elements of preventive care. Further research is needed to maximise its impact, including identifying strategies to increase client uptake.</p>

              <p>Modifiable health risk behaviours are a key contributor to chronic disease morbidity and mortality worldwide (<xref rid="bibr3-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organisation, 2009</xref>). Compared to the general population, people with a mental illness have a higher prevalence of four key risk behaviours: tobacco smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol overconsumption and physical inactivity (<xref rid="bibr6-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Kilian et al., 2006</xref>). These risk behaviours influence the development of metabolic risks, such as overweight, obesity and high blood pressure (<xref rid="bibr3-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Forouzanfar et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, the prevalence of chronic diseases is considerably higher among people with a mental illness in Australia (<xref rid="bibr20-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>) and other high-income countries (<xref rid="bibr12-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Druss and Walker, 2011</xref>), contributing to a substantially reduced life expectancy in this population group (<xref rid="bibr27-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>The routine provision of ‘preventive care’ to address chronic disease risk behaviours is recommended by clinical practice guidelines for mental health services (<xref rid="bibr39-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">NSW Department of Health, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bibr50-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organisation, 2018</xref>). In particular, community mental health services (providing ambulatory specialised mental health care) present a key opportunity to provide preventive care, given their role in treating a large proportion of people with a mental illness (<xref rid="bibr4-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2017</xref>). The ‘AAR’ framework has been recommended to guide the provision of preventive care by health services generally, comprising <italic>assessment</italic> of clients’ risk behaviours, provision of brief <italic>advice</italic> to modify risk behaviours and <italic>referral</italic> to specialist services (<xref rid="bibr19-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Glasgow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr46-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Schroeder, 2005</xref>). Despite such recommendations, preventive care is infrequently provided by community mental health services (<xref rid="bibr5-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref rid="bibr9-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2014</xref>). Low rates of screening and referral for associated metabolic risks among people with a mental illness have also been reported (<xref rid="bibr34-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
              <p>One model for enhancing preventive care provision in community mental health settings is to dedicate a specific clinical position to the provision of such care. Four studies have quantitatively examined the effectiveness of this model for increasing the provision of preventive care in such settings. For one study, the role of the ‘specialist preventive care clinician’ was focused on encouraging and supplementing preventive care provision by clinicians during routine consultations (<xref rid="bibr42-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Osborn et al., 2010</xref>), whereas for the remaining three studies the role focused on offering preventive care in an additional consultation (<xref rid="bibr13-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Druss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>). Two of the three studies examining the provision of an additional preventive care consultation reported outcomes relating to the provision of preventive care (<xref rid="bibr13-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Druss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al., 2014</xref>). In the first study, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the United States, clients were randomised to receive either usual care or the offer of additional consultations with a ‘care manager’ located in the community mental health service (<xref rid="bibr13-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Druss et al., 2010</xref>). The care manager provided health education regarding smoking, exercise, nutrition, weight and self-examination, as well as assistance in overcoming barriers to accessing primary medical care. Outcomes were reported as the proportion of preventive care elements received across four domains: physical examination, screening tests, vaccinations and health education, at 12-month follow-up. The intervention condition was found to receive a significantly higher proportion of preventive care elements compared to the usual care condition (average of 58.7% vs 21.6%, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The effect of the intervention on the provision of preventive care for individual risk behaviours was not assessed.</p>
              <p>The second study, a cross-sectional study from Australia, compared rates of metabolic monitoring (for exercise, smoking, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference, cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein level) between two community mental health services (<xref rid="bibr32-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al., 2014</xref>). Metabolic monitoring was provided within routine consultations in one service and provided by a specialist clinician in the other. Data collected from medical records over 12 months indicated that the proportion of clients who received at least one component of metabolic monitoring was significantly higher when provided by a specialist clinician, compared to provision in routine mental health consultations (78% vs 3%, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). The effectiveness of this model on other care elements (advice and referral) was not assessed quantitatively. A further limitation of both studies was the non-reporting of client uptake of the additional preventive care consultation(s), which is suggested to influence the effectiveness of the model at the population level (<xref rid="bibr43-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Ostermann et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>To address these evidence gaps, an RCT was conducted in a community mental health service to determine the effectiveness of the offer of an additional consultation with a specialist preventive care clinician, in increasing client-reported receipt of, and satisfaction with, preventive care. The outcomes of interest were client-reported receipt of three elements of preventive care (assessment, advice and referral) for four risk behaviours (tobacco smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol overconsumption and physical inactivity) and client satisfaction with preventive care received.</p>

                <title>Study design and setting</title>
                <p>A two-arm, parallel-group RCT was conducted in one community mental health service in regional New South Wales, Australia. The service provides treatment to clients with a range of diagnoses and acuity. The local health care policy directs the provision of preventive care (assessment, advice and referral to telephone coaching services) for four chronic disease risk behaviours (tobacco smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol overconsumption and physical inactivity) by mental health clinicians within routine mental health consultations (<xref rid="bibr21-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Hunter New England Local Health District, 2010</xref>). The reported proportion of clients receiving preventive care under this policy is low (<xref rid="bibr7-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2015b</xref>). A published study protocol described the methods for this study (<xref rid="bibr15-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Fehily et al., 2017</xref>). This paper reports secondary outcomes: client-reported receipt of preventive care and satisfaction with care received.</p>
                <p>Between March and September 2017, a ‘specialist preventive care clinician’ was embedded in the community mental health service. In this real-world trial undertaken in the context of routine clinical care, clients were randomly allocated to receive either usual care (provided by community mental health clinicians within routine consultations, in accordance with the service policy) or usual care plus the offer of the additional consultation and telephone follow-up with the specialist preventive care clinician. Outcome data were obtained via client telephone interviews at baseline (February–September 2017) and at 1-month follow-up (March–October 2017). For participants in the intervention condition, the additional consultation was scheduled to occur between these two time points. The Human Research Ethics Committees of Hunter New England Health (Ref No. 16/02/17/4.09) and the University of Newcastle (Ref No. H-2016-0123) approved the research. The trial was prospectively registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (No. ACTRN12616001519448).</p>

                <title>Sample eligibility and procedures</title>
                <p>Clients attending the community mental health service were eligible to participate in the study if identified by service staff as new or existing clients, 18 years or older and not deemed too unwell to be enrolled, as determined by their treating team. Sample size was determined based on the number of eligible clients attending the service and a previously reported power analysis (<xref rid="bibr15-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Fehily et al., 2017</xref>). Approximately 30 eligible clients were randomly selected each week and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the usual care or the intervention condition (prior to baseline data collection) according to a statistician-generated random allocation sequence (permuted block randomisation with block sizes of 2, 4 and 6). Clients and clinicians were not blinded to study allocation, consistent with what would be expected if this model of care was provided under routine care delivery conditions.</p>

Acceptance of a referral to each of these telephone services (two outcomes) was also calculated for all participants eligible for such a referral (yes vs no/don’t know/not offered).</p>
                <p>Three variables were calculated to reflect the receipt of each preventive care element for all risks combined: (1) assessment for all four risks, (2) advice for all behaviours for which the participant was at risk and (3) referral to the relevant telephone service(s) for which the participant was eligible (i.e. the Quitline and/or the Get Healthy). The three outcomes pertaining to metabolic risk were dichotomised: advice provided (yes vs no/don’t know), GP referral offered (yes vs no/don’t know) and GP referral acceptance (yes vs no/don’t know/not offered).</p>
                <p>Uptake of the preventive care consultation (attended vs did not) and telephone follow-up (completed vs did not) were dichotomised and assessed descriptively.</p>

                  <title>Intervention effectiveness</title>
                  <p>Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, i.e., all participants in originally assigned conditions, utilising all the available data (<italic>n</italic> = 444) (<xref rid="bibr23-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Little et al., 2012</xref>), for the 18 preventive care outcomes. Logistic regression was carried out using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) to assess changes in outcomes over time in the intervention compared to usual care condition. Intervention effects were determined by the risk ratio (RR) and allocation-by-time interactions. Missing data were estimated under the maximum likelihood function. Factors significantly associated with attrition were determined using logistic regression (diagnosis and length of current episode of care) and entered into all models to control for the missing-at-random assumption. Additional potential baseline confounders (age and gender) were also included in the models if significant. Based on recommendations in the literature, the threshold for statistical significance was α = 0.05 (<xref rid="bibr28-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Estimated proportions, RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined from the fitted models. For one outcome (Quitline referral acceptance), a Bayesian simulation method was used as the number of events was zero. The beta posterior distributions used for simulation were based on conjugate binomial likelihoods and a uniform beta prior. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the outcomes analysed using GLMMs (17 outcomes) to test the robustness of the results, using a conservative approach where all missing data were coded as ‘worst case scenario’ (<xref rid="bibr30-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Little et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Employing the same statistical method described for the primary analysis, post hoc per-protocol analyses were undertaken for the preventive care outcomes where intervention participants who did not attend the additional consultation were excluded from the analysis (usual care <italic>n</italic> = 215; intervention <italic>n</italic> = 79) (<xref rid="bibr2-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Armijo-Olivo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

                <p>In the primary analysis, for assessment outcomes, from baseline to follow-up, there was a significantly greater absolute increase in clients reporting assessment in favour of the intervention group for four of five outcomes: nutrition (+25.2), alcohol (+6.2), physical activity (+14.0) and all four risks combined (+27.1) compared to the usual care condition (+7.5, –10.1, –3.1 and +5.4, respectively) (<xref rid="table3-0004867420914741" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The intervention effect (RR) was 2.18, 2.21, 2.16 and 4.00 times that of the usual care condition for assessment of nutrition, alcohol, physical activity and all risks combined, respectively. There was no significant differential change between groups for assessment of tobacco smoking.</p>

              <p>This paper is the first to rigorously and comprehensively examine the effects of an additional preventive care consultation with a specialist clinician on the provision of specific elements of preventive care addressing multiple risk behaviours to clients of a community mental health service. The primary analysis found that participants in the intervention condition were significantly more likely, relative to preventive care provision in routine consultations only, to have received assessment, advice and referral for all risk behaviours combined, with a significant effect being observed for at least one of the individual risk behaviours for each element of care. These findings suggest that offering clients an additional consultation with a specialist preventive care clinician represents an effective approach for increasing the delivery of preventive care to people with a mental illness, a currently underserved population group with a particular need for such care.</p>
              <p>For the preventive care elements of assessment and referral, the study found a significant effect for almost all (10 of 12) outcomes. However, only one significant outcome was found with regard to ‘advice’ for individual risk behaviours (nutrition). The latter finding could be due to measurement factors such as the limitations of self-report, including participants’ knowledge of what constitutes ‘advice’, and recall. This observed lack of effect is in contrast with the significant increases for ‘referral’ outcomes. The latter finding is of particular importance as ‘referral’ has been suggested to be the most critical element of preventive care to ensure successful long-term behaviour change (<xref rid="bibr19-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Glasgow et al., 2004</xref>) and has been the least likely to have been positively affected in previous trials of interventions to increase the provision of preventive care in routine health consultations (<xref rid="bibr8-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">McElwaine et al., 2014</xref>). However, the overall proportion of intervention participants who accepted referrals to the Quitline (11%), Get Healthy Service (19%) and GPs (14%) could be improved. While not possible in this study, future research with sufficient statistical power may determine factors associated with accepting such referrals, to inform strategies to increase acceptance and ensure that clients receive extended, specialist behaviour change support.</p>
              <p>The intervention effect in this study varied across the risk behaviours, being least effective for smoking, with only one significant effect being observed (i.e. Quitline referral acceptance). This lack of effect for smoking outcomes may be attributable to the high baseline levels of provision of assessment’ and ‘advice’ for smoking (above 45%). Post hoc power analyses indicated that the study may have been underpowered to detect an intervention effect for smoking assessment (detectable: 14% vs observed: 11% difference) and advice (detectable: 20% vs observed: 12% difference). A previous RCT of this model of care (<xref rid="bibr42-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Osborn et al., 2010</xref>), as well as previous trials of interventions to increase preventive care provision in routine consultations in both community general health (<xref rid="bibr31-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">McElwaine et al., 2014</xref>) and mental health (<xref rid="bibr8-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2016</xref>) settings, have been ineffective in increasing provision of assessment, advice and referral for smoking. Further research is required to identify the determinants of smoking cessation care provision as a basis for developing relevant practice change strategies.</p>
              <p>Approximately a third of the eligible participants who were offered the additional preventive care consultation attended. In line with clinical guidelines (<xref rid="bibr16-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>), the consultation was offered on a universal basis, i.e., to all clients regardless of their demographic or risk characteristics. The observed level of attendance is less than a previous trial of this model of care (75%) (<xref rid="bibr44-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>). However, this previous trial employed narrower eligibility criteria, including only clients who expressed willingness to attend such an additional consult. A need exists for further research to identify the barriers to and facilitators of client acceptance of an offer for the additional consultation, particularly when such an offer is made universally. Such information is required to inform the inclusion of strategies to increase client motivation and interest in taking up the additional consultation (<xref rid="bibr44-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, alternative approaches to the delivery of such a consultation should be considered. One potential approach involves the consultation being provided by a person with a lived experience of mental illness (‘peer worker’), given their ability to provide advice and role modelling informed by their lived experiences (<xref rid="bibr18-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2013</xref>). Previous research suggests that receiving healthy lifestyle support from a peer worker may be perceived by people with a mental illness as more acceptable than a mental health professional (<xref rid="bibr48-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>A further opportunity for enhancing the uptake of the model of care assessed in this study, and its overall effectiveness, involves identifying strategies for increasing the provision of preventive care in routine consultations. Such care provision has been reported by community mental health service clients to be highly acceptable (<xref rid="bibr7-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2015b</xref>). However, improving its delivery in this clinical context has been found to be challenging. For example, a previous Australian study examining the effectiveness of an evidence-based practice change intervention in increasing the provision of preventive care in routine mental health consultations found a significant effect in only 1 of 16 preventive care outcomes (<xref rid="bibr8-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2016</xref>). Tailoring the practice change strategies to the particular circumstances, context and culture of community mental health services may enhance their effectiveness. To date, such tailoring has not been reported.</p>
              <p>The findings suggest that there is potential for the specialist clinician model and warrants consideration of its feasibility to be implemented. A key component of such an assessment involves its feasibility in terms of the additional resources required and benefits accrued. To address this issue, analysis is required of its cost-effectiveness and budget impact (<xref rid="bibr10-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bilinski et al., 2017</xref>). Only one previous study, undertaken in the United States, has assessed the cost-effectiveness of this model of care (<xref rid="bibr14-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Druss et al., 2011</xref>). The study reported that, from the perspective of the health system, it was more cost-effective than usual care in increasing the quality of preventive care services received: physical examinations, screening tests, vaccinations and health education. No economic analyses for this model have been conducted in Australia, nor have analyses been reported where the focus of the additional consultation was specifically preventive care for risk behaviours.</p>
              <p>Results from this study suggest that the intervention and usual care condition did not significantly differ in terms of clients’ reported satisfaction with their receipt of preventive care, with over two thirds of participants in both groups reporting high levels of satisfaction for all care elements. Previous research has also found that clients receiving preventive care in routine consultations and clients receiving a specialist clinician–delivered intervention both reported similar, high levels of satisfaction (<xref rid="bibr42-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Osborn et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
              <sec id="section28-0004867420914741">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>With regard to limitations, there were significant differences between those who did and did not consent to participate in terms of psychiatric diagnosis and length of time in treatment. To address the risk of this potential bias influencing the study findings, these characteristics were entered into all models. These factors should be considered in the development of future interventions, suggesting a need for specific strategies to target these hard-to-reach individuals. Second, although specified in the study protocol, data regarding the number of appointments with the mental health service were unable to be obtained. In lieu of this information, length of time in treatment was utilised as an alternative. As the number of appointments has been reported to be associated with receipt of preventive care (<xref rid="bibr7-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Bartlem et al., 2015b</xref>), future studies may wish to include this as a covariate. Third, a large proportion of clients were unable to be contacted for both the offer of the preventive care consultation (by the specialist clinician) and data collection (by telephone interviewers). The difficulty in contacting, recruiting and retaining people with a mental illness has previously been acknowledged as particularly challenging in both research (<xref rid="bibr24-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Kanuch et al., 2016</xref>) and clinical settings (<xref rid="bibr41-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Olfson et al., 2009</xref>). Further qualitative research is required to investigate the factors from a client perspective that may limit their participation in such research and in the uptake of such care. Finally, data regarding ethnicity (other than Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status) and language were not collected. While this trial was undertaken within the context of real-world mental health service delivery, replication of the study with a more rigorous trial design and in multiple mental health service sites is warranted. Furthermore, given the acknowledged role of GPs in providing preventive care to people with a mental illness, research is needed to explore strategies to additionally support provision of preventive care in this setting (<xref rid="bibr45-0004867420914741" ref-type="bibr">Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, 2015</xref>).</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Mental health services face significant challenges in providing comprehensive preventive care. This study suggests that offering clients preventive care via an additional consultation with a specialist preventive care clinician embedded in a community mental health service may be an effective model for increasing the provision of comprehensive multi-risk preventive care. It provides evidence to support such care being provided systematically, regardless of characteristics such as psychiatric diagnosis or interest in change. Further research examining the feasibility of implementing this model of care as well as strategies for enhancing its effectiveness is required.</p>
