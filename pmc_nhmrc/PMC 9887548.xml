                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Prophylactic dressings are increasingly used to prevent pressure injuries in hospitalised patients. However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of these dressings is still emerging. This trial aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a prophylactic silicone foam border dressing in preventing sacral pressure injuries in medical-surgical patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, randomised controlled trial. A sample size of 1320 was calculated to have &gt;90% power to detect a 5% difference in the primary outcome at an alpha of 0.05. Adult patients admitted to participating medical-surgical wards are screened for eligibility: â¥18 years, admitted to hospital within the previous 36 h, expected length of stay of â¥24 h, and assessed high risk for hospital-acquired pressure injury. Consenting participants are randomly allocated to either prophylactic silicone foam dressing intervention or usual care without any dressing as the control group via a web-based randomisation service independent of the trial. Patients are enrolled across three Australian hospitals. The primary outcome is the cumulative incidence of patients who develop a sacral pressure injury. Secondary outcomes include the time to sacral pressure injury, incidence of severity (stage) of sacral pressure injury, cost-effectiveness of dressings, and process evaluation. Participant outcomes are assessed daily for up to 14 days by blinded independent outcome assessors using de-identified, digitally modified sacral photographs. Those who develop a sacral pressure injury are followed for an additional 14 days to estimate costs of pressure injury treatment. Analysis of clinical outcomes will be based on intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and sensitivity analyses.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This trial aims to provide definitive evidence on the effect prophylactic dressings have on the development of hospital-acquired sacral pressure injuries in medical-surgical patients. A parallel economic evaluation of pressure injury prevention and treatment will enable evidence-informed decisions and policy. The inclusion of a process evaluation will help to explain the contextual factors that may have a bearing on trial results including the acceptability of the dressings to patients and staff. The trial commenced 5 March 2020 and has been significantly delayed due to COVID-19.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par25">Many hospitalised patients are at high risk of developing pressure injuries (PI). PI onset can be rapid, with injury of skin and/or tissue over bony prominences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Given its anatomical position, the most common location for PI is the sacrum, which is particularly vulnerable to injury and difficult to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is due to pressure and shear that can result from limited mobility and/or long periods of time sitting due to head of bed elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">A recent meta-analysis found the global prevalence of hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) in adults was 8.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HAPI cost approximately US$11 billion in the USA (between the period of 2000 and 2012) (US) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], Â£1.4âÂ£2.1 billion in the UK (2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and in European countries such as the Netherlands up to $2.8 billion annually (USD in 2009) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A 2022 cost analysis of HAPI in Australian public hospitals reported AU $9.11 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. HAPI have negative consequences for patients in terms of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and represent a significant economic burden for health services and communities. Therefore, there is increasing emphasis on implementing pressure injury prevention (PIP) strategies. These strategies include risk assessment, support surfaces, nutritional support, repositioning, and moisture and incontinence management, and more recently, prophylactic dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Preventing HAPI has the potential to save healthcare dollars which can be redirected to other priority areas, free-up hospital beds and improve the overall quality of patient care, outcomes, and experience consistent with national and international priorities.</p>
                <p id="Par27">There is an increasing emphasis on the use of a range of PIP strategies, including the use of prophylactic dressings. These dressings have demonstrated clinical effectiveness in preventing PI in some patient populations and contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, authors of a Cochrane Review updated in 2018 reiterated the certainty of evidence for using dressings in HAPI prevention was low to very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since the 2018 Cochrane Review, authors of two high-quality trials of prophylactic silicone dressings have reported positive outcomes but recommend further rigorous testing in clinical practice is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Prior to these two studies, rigorous methodological approaches (that is, randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinded outcome assessment via photography) in assessing the feasibility of using prophylactic dressings to prevent PI a general medical-surgical patient population had only been reported in a single pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">Cost-effectiveness analyses of prophylactic dressings are sparse. Two within-trial cost-analyses reported prophylactic dressings led to cost savings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The first trial used a retrospective approach to cost analysis that did not include inpatient bed-day costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], while the more recent trial calculated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on the average duration of patient admission and expressed as cost per PI avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">This previous research led us to design a robust randomised controlled trial (RCT) trial to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a prophylactic silicone foam border dressing in preventing sacral HAPI in hospitalised patients assessed at risk for PI. Process evaluation data will also be collected, to evaluate contextual factors (e.g. patient-, provider-, and system-level factors) that may have moderated the effect of an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par30">The primary objectives of the EEPOC trial are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par31">Determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a prophylactic silicone foam border dressing in preventing sacral hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPI) in hospitalised patients assessed at risk for PI</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Describe the characteristics and clinical care received by patients who develop a sacral HAPI up to 14 days, or until hospital discharge or death after PI occurrence</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Understand patients and staff perspectives on the use of prophylactic dressing</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par34">The primary hypothesis is cumulative incidence (expressed as a percentage) of patients who develop sacral HAPI up to 14 days of admission will be less in patients who are randomly allocated to the routine care plus prophylactic silicone foam dressing group (intervention), compared to patients allocated to routine care only (control).</p>
                <p id="Par35">The secondary hypothesis is patients in the prophylactic dressing group (intervention) will have better outcomes compared to the routine care only group (control) including (1) time to onset of sacral HAPI, (2) incidence of severity of sacral HAPI (based on stage), (3) cost-effectiveness of sacral dressings for the prevention of HAPI, and (4) process evaluation.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par36">This study is a multi-site, parallel group, superiority RCT comparing the effectiveness of a prophylactic silicone foam border dressing in preventing sacral HAPI in hospitalised patients assessed at risk for PI. The unit of randomisation is eligible consenting patients who receive either the prophylactic sacral dressing or the routine care alone. Randomised to either the dressing group or the routine care only group is via a computer-generated 1:1 ratio, in varying permuted block sizes of four, six, and eight, stratified by hospital and division (i.e. medical or surgical).</p>
                <p id="Par37">All patients are followed for up to 14 days or until the trial endpoint, which is development of a new sacral HAPI, hospital discharge, or deathâwhichever occurs first. Patients who develop a HAPI in either arm are exited from the prevention trial and followed for an additional 14 days until discharge or deathâwhichever occurs first (up to a total of 28 days) to provide data on PI prevention and treatment costs. This will enable an extended economic evaluation that considers the benefits of prevention in terms of any reduced HAPI treatment costs or HLOS, alongside the costs of prevention.</p>
                <p id="Par38">An integral part of this study is its process evaluation. Process evaluations are particularly important for multi-site trials where it is necessary to determine whether interventions are implemented and received consistently across sites and to understand differences between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. They also provide detailed documentation to enable replication, and information regarding the mechanism of action for significant or non-significant effects, thereby enhancing an interventionâs validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study setting {9}</title>
                <p id="Par39">This multi-site RCT is currently taking place at three acute-care public hospitals in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Two of the hospitals are quaternary hospitals and the third, a tertiary facility. All sites have participated in previous clinical trials. For more details, refer to the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12619000763145.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Each site is supported by associate investigator (AI) nurse leaders, who provide ongoing clinical expertise and support for the study. We recruit eligible participants from general medical-surgical wards at each site. The inclusion of multiple sites and wards spreads the recruitment burden and allows testing of the intervention in a variety of acute medical and surgical settings to ensure diverse geographical, unit size, and sub-speciality representation.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria {10}</title>
                <p id="Par41">A consecutive sample of all eligible at-risk adult patients admitted to the participating medical-surgical wards are invited to participate in the trial by registered nurse research assistants (ResN). Patients who meet the following inclusion criteria are eligible for recruitment into the sample:</p>

                <title>Who will take informed consent? {26a}</title>
                <p id="Par52">ResNs at each site trained in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) screen and recruit participants, obtain their consent, and randomly allocate them to a study group via an independent web-based randomisation service (in accordance with the hospital procedures informed by state governance and international standards). Written informed consent is sought from each patient, family member, or legal guardian (proxy) prior to randomisation.</p>
                <p id="Par53">If consenting participants are allocated to the intervention group, they will be asked to assess their level of satisfaction with comfort of the dressing. They may also be invited to participate in an individual interview conducted by the research assistant to describe their experience of participating in the trial, as part of the process evaluation.</p>
                <p id="Par54">If the participant or their person responsible (i.e. proxy) is unable to read, an impartial witness must be present during the entire consent process. After the patient or their proxy has orally consented to the patientâs participation and has signed the consent form, the witness must also sign and date the consent to attest the information is understood by the patient or their proxy and consent was given freely. Furthermore, where the impairment, disability, or illness is temporary or episodic, an attempt will be made to seek consent at a time when the condition does not interfere with the personâs capacity to give consent.</p>
                <p id="Par55">Participants, their family member, or legal guardian are advised that they can withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal will not jeopardise any treatment or relationship with the hospital. A Revocation of Consent form is provided to all participants on enrolment as a means of withdrawal and clearly states that in the event of participant withdrawal, data already collected will be included in the aggregated analysis but that no further data will be collected.</p>

                <title>Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data {26b}</title>
                <p id="Par56">As part of the process evaluation that is undertaken alongside the clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], it is important that we are able to determine the proportion of eligible patients who refused to participate and describe the demographic characteristics of <italic>both</italic> eligible patients who participated and those who do not (i.e. non-participants). To achieve this, we are collecting demographic characteristics for non-participants, such as age, gender, type of admission (i.e. medical or surgical), and pressure injury risk. Therefore, as part of the consent procedure (i.e. included as an additional tick box in the PICF), eligible patients or their proxy who do not wish to participate will be invited to consent to some non-identifiable information about them being collected by the research team.</p>
                <p id="Par57">In the latter part of the trial, a subsample of patients from the intervention group and nursing staff will be purposively selected to reflect a range of demographic and clinical factors as part of the process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Nursing staff will be invited to participate following an informed consent process. Research personnel who are involved in the implementation of the trial (such as ResNs and outcome assessors) will also be invited to participate in individual, semi-structured interviews following an informed consent process. The aim of the interviews will be to explore ResN perceptions and experiences of being involved in the EEPOC trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par59">If allocated to the intervention group, participants have a prophylactic sacral dressing applied by a trained research nurse (ResN), following the manufacturerâs instructions. The trial dressing is the MepilexÂ® Border Sacrum, a foam border silicon dressing available in two sizes to accommodate physical differences of participants. The dressing manufacturer recommends the dressing be changed when the edge begins to roll and/or loses adhesion or becomes soiled. Dressings will also be changed if saturation occurs, if staff accidentally remove the dressing, or if the dressing becomes dislodged.</p>
                  <p id="Par60">The ResN takes a baseline photograph of the participantâs sacrum and then applies a silicone foam border dressing (MepilexÂ®). The dressing and sacral skin are visually inspected every day for up to 14 days. The frequency of dressing replacements (with reason, including device deficiencies) will be documented. Participants in the intervention group will continue to receive routine care, as per hospital procedures informed by national standards and international practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>

Routine care consists of regular skin inspection and assessment, nursing care via use of a pressure redistribution overlay on a standard mattress, or removal of a standard mattress and replacement with a pressure redistributing mattress, possible multidisciplinary review, and second hourly repositioning.</p>
                  <p id="Par62">Participants in the control group also have their sacrum photographed every day following recruitment but do not have a dressing applied to the area. Photographs are edited in the same way as the intervention group before being sent to a blinded-to-intervention assessor for evaluation.</p>

                  <p id="Par63">Where there is evidence of skin irritation and/or participant-reported discomfort and/orÂ itchiness due to the dressing, the dressing will be removed, the skin reaction reported using standard hospital incident reporting protocols, and the patient exited from the clinical study. Where the patient has developed persistent urinary and/or faecal incontinence, the sacral dressing will be removed, and the patient exited from the clinical study. In our pilot trial, only six participants (5% of the total sample) reported dressing discomfort, due to dressing migration or mild itchiness without any other clinical symptoms of allergic reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par64">Note that in either group, diagnosis of a sacral HAPI resulting in the patient exiting the study will be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the clinician caring for the patient and/or the team leader. This decision will not influence the assessment of the outcome assessor (i.e. they will not be aware of the decision made by the clinician/team leader). Where there is indecision among the clinical staff caring for the patient regarding the diagnosis of a Stage 1 PI, the assessment by the blinded assessor will be used to determine if the patient should exit the clinical study.</p>

                <p id="Par65">ResNs allocated to each site received training regarding Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the study protocol (including subsequent amendments), intervention, recruitment strategies, data collection using an electronic database, and inspection of the sacrum surgical site including how to take photographs (in terms of consistent angle, lighting, and distance where possible) and edit photographs prior to commencement in the role. A manual detailing the standard operating procedures (SOP) for the trial (including subsequent updates) is available to all members of the research team for top-up training to ensure ongoing protocol adherence and consistency. The information provided ensures all participants receive identical verbal and written information and instructions regarding the study. In addition, ResNs have received education from the dressing manufacturer representatives.</p>
                <p id="Par66">Audits of 10% of photographs have been taken to evaluate the quality of photographs (e.g. lighting, angle, distance) and photo modification to conceal dressing markings. Detailed instructions and images have been added to the SOP to provide continued support to ResNs and training new staff.</p>
                <p id="Par67">Regular assessment of treatment fidelity by the clinical trial coordinator (CTC) focuses on data integrity, the trial dressing and its application, photography, and image editing. Fleiss Kappa analysis will estimate inter-rater reliability between blinded outcome assessors. A score of â¥08 will be considered acceptable.</p>

Given the intervention, it is not feasible for patients, healthcare professionals, and ResN to be blinded to group allocation.</p>

                <p id="Par88">After screening, consent, and randomisation, data are collected directly from the participant or their proxy, and their health record at baseline and then daily for up to 14 days until the trial endpoint (i.e. development of a new sacral HAPI, discharge, or deathâwhichever occurs first). Participants who develop a HAPI in either arm exit the prevention trial and are followed up for up to 14 days (until discharge or deathâwhichever comes first) for a total of up to 28 days, to provide data on PI treatment to support the economic evaluation.</p>
                <p id="Par89">Each recruited participantâs hospital information (date of birth, unique record number) is recorded in an eCRF available only to investigator RMW, the CTC, and site ResNs to ensure participant confidentiality. Participantsâ demographic and health data including gender, diagnosis or surgery, reason for admission, mobility status, body mass index, nutritional deficiencies, the type of and number of comorbidities (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cognitive impairment, and malnutrition on admission), current smoking status, PI risk, existing PI (other than sacral) and its treatment/management, previous history of PI, number of days enrolled in the trial, and HLOS (documented at discharge for all participants) is recorded in a separate eCRF (electronic clinical research form). A photograph is taken of the patient's sacral skinÂ and sent to the blinded outcome assessor to confirm its diagnosis. A trained CTC monitors recruitment and data collection across all sites and monthly reports are presented to the chief and associate investigators.</p>
                <p id="Par90">As part of the process evaluation, where a patient is unable to provide information for self-report data (e.g. Patient Participation in Pressure Injury Prevention Scale, assessment of satisfaction and comfort), the ResN documents the reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These data are considered âmissingâ data for the purpose of analyses, but the reason and proportion of participants who do not have these data due to cognitive impairment, for example, will be reported in reports/publications. For other data that requires participant self-report (e.g. in the instance where weight or height is not documented), the ResN elicits this information from the participantâs proxy if possible or attempts to collect this data in accordance with the protocol and SOP manual (e.g. patientâs medical record, Demi Span, using chair scales on the ward where possible).</p>
                <p id="Par91">Data on resource utilisation associated with prevention are collected including the number of dressings used; personnel time to apply, remove, and change dressings; and any treatment required for any local adverse effects from the dressings. To enable an extended cost-benefit analysis, resources used to treat sacral HAPI are also recorded for those patients that develop a sacral PI during the trial. HLOS is recorded for all trial participants on discharge from hospital.</p>
                <p id="Par92">Digital photography is a novel and practical solution to address blinding. Using study-specific and password-protected iPads, research nurses at each site take high-resolution, de-identified digital photographs of every participantâs sacrum at baseline and each subsequent day they are enrolled in the trial. Photographs are edited using Adobe photo editing software to âblurâ surrounding skin to conceal atraumatic skin markings for participants in the intervention group or other markings that may indicate the participant is in the control group (e.g. clothing or bedsheets). Except for the baseline photograph, all modified photos are uploaded into a secure data collection platform and forwarded to a blinded outcome assessor on the same day they are taken. Where a stage 1 (i.e. non-balanceable erythema) is suspected, the patient is be repositioned where possible, the site reassessed after 30 min, and the photograph taken (35). For each photograph, the ResN notifies the blinded outcome assessor as to whether the skin is blanching or non-blanching. The patient exits the clinical study if it is determined they have developed a sacral HAPI which is reported to clinical staff. If the clinical staff caring for the patient diagnose a stage 1 HAPI (even if the blinded assessor did not), the patient is still exited from the study. However, this decision is not disclosed to and therefore does not influence the assessment of the blinded outcome assessor. If the patient has a sacral HAPI, they are included in the estimation of PI treatment costs.</p>

                <p id="Par102">The patient is the unit of measurement. The primary outcome, development of a new sacral HAPI, is dichotomous. The main analysis will be based on comparisons of the cumulative incidence of pressure injuries in the two groups. Relative risk (RR) of HAPI for the intervention group compared to the control group will be computed and reported along with 95% confidence intervals and <italic>P</italic> values.</p>
                <p id="Par103">We anticipate that prognostic imbalance of known (e.g. age, BMI, number of comorbidities) and unknown prognostic factors is unlikely between the groups due to central randomisation and treatment concealment. However, if we find any differences, we will conduct adjusted analyses using multiple regression models. We do not expect effect sizes to vary between hospitals, but centre-to-centre variability will be assessed, and cluster-adjusted analysis will be carried out as a form of sensitivity analysis if required. Patientsâ declining to participate in the trial are given the opportunity to consent to some non-identifiable data being collected (i.e. admission type, age, sex, and PI risk score). These data will enable us to compare some characteristics of eligible and consenting patients (i.e. participants) versus patients who are eligible but not consenting (i.e. non-participants).</p>
                <p id="Par104">For the secondary endpoints, âtime to HAPIâ will be analysed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and log rank tests. Hazard ratios along with 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Additional Cox regression models will be used to detect the influence of prognostic factors. As for the âstage of HAPIâ, a chi-square test will evaluate if the intervention group differs from the control patients. All data will be entered directly into a web-based data collection tool (REDCap) and then exported into SPSS (V 24). Prior to analysis, a rigorous process of data cleaning to check outlying figures, missing, and implausible data against source data will be undertaken. Sample attrition will be managed via intention-to-treat analysis to ensure an unbiased comparison of the groups by randomisation. An expert biostatistician will lead all analyses.</p>

In the first step, a cost-effectiveness analysis will compare the costs and effects of prevention using the trial primary outcome (cumulative incidence) as the measure of effect. Data collected on costs and clinical outcomes will be used to calculate the incremental cost per sacral HAPI avoided, which is the difference in the mean costs of prevention (i.e. measured to the trial endpoint) divided by the difference in sacral HAPI incidence. In an extended step, a cost-benefit analysis will be undertaken to incorporate the benefits of prevention measured in dollars using data from the extended 28-day follow-up. Benefits will include any difference in costs of sacral HAPI treatment and HLOS between groups (documented on discharge for all participants).</p>

However, a per-protocol analysis for trial participants who consented, were randomised, completed the baseline assessment, and had at least one outcome assessment will also be conducted. Where enrolled participants do not have at least one outcome assessment (due to for example unexpected early discharge), they will be defined as âlost to follow-upâ, regardless of their time in the trial. While all efforts are made to reduce loss to follow-up, as in most trials, it is inevitable that some missing outcome data may occur. In such circumstances, we envisage using best (no PI) and worst case (PI) scenarios to analyse the impact of missing outcome. These scenarios will form sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing outcome data, assuming those missing outcomes had no event or had an event.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par125">This protocol outlines the design of this pragmatic RCT to examine the effect of prophylactic sacral dressings on the cumulative incidence of PI in hospitalised adults. Our trial has several strengths. We are using an appropriately powered, robust multicentre pragmatic RCT design that is the largest trial of its kinds in this area. We are conducting an economic evaluation alongside the trial, and a process evaluation to ensure any difference in outcomes between the groups can be attributable to the intervention or contextual issues. With so few economic studies in this area, this parallel cost-effectiveness analysis will provide valuable health economic information to guide decision-making of health service managers to better balance quality patient care with economic efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Digital photography and photo editing software are being used, which enables blinded, independent outcome assessors to assess the sacral skin for PI remotely, thereby reducing their ability to identify group allocation. This method represents a significant and innovative approach to clinical research. Finally, this multicentre RCT is independent of industry funding and therefore minimises potential for a conflict of interest and bias.</p>
