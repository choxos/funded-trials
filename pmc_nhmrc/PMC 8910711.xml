                <p>Preventive care to address chronic disease risk behaviours is infrequently provided by community mental health services. In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, 12 community mental health services in 3 Local Health Districts in New South Wales, Australia, will be randomised to either an intervention group (implementing a new model of providing preventive care) or a control group (usual care). The model of care comprises three components: (1) a dedicated ‘healthy choices’ consultation offered by a ‘healthy choices’ clinician; (2) embedding information regarding risk factors into clients’ care plans; and (3) the continuation of preventive care by mental health clinicians in ongoing consultations. Evidence-based implementation strategies will support the model implementation, which will be tailored by being co-developed with service managers and clinicians. The primary outcomes are client-reported receipt of: (1) an assessment of chronic disease risks (tobacco smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol use and physical inactivity); (2) brief advice regarding relevant risk behaviours; and (3) referral to at least one behaviour change support. Resources to develop and implement the intervention will be captured to enable an assessment of cost effectiveness and affordability. The findings will inform the development of future service delivery initiatives to achieve guideline- and policy-concordant preventive care delivery.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Mental health conditions are a clinically diagnosable disorder that impacts a person’s thinking, feeling, behaviour or mood [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The term covers a range of diagnoses (such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders and psychoses and severities) and may lead to people presenting to a mental health service for treatment [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A higher prevalence of key chronic disease risk factors (tobacco smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol use, physical inactivity and overweight/obesity [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) contributes substantially to the greater burden of chronic disease morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] experienced by people with a mental health condition. Internationally, the median gap in life expectancy is 10 years, which is evident across the range of mental health conditions [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Australia, the average gap in life expectancy for people receiving treatment from a psychiatric facility, compared to the general population, is 12–16 years, with approximately three quarters due to potentially preventable chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The need to redress the physical health inequity experienced by people with a mental health condition, and specifically the higher prevalence of chronic disease risk factors, is a recognised priority internationally [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and in Australia [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>

In Australia, community mental health services, which provide support to the large majority of people who receive specialist mental health treatment, represent a key opportunity to provide preventive care to a large proportion of people with a mental health condition and particularly those with severe mental ill-health [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Evidence-based frameworks to guide such care include the ‘AAR’ framework: <italic toggle="yes">assessment</italic> of chronic disease risk factors, <italic toggle="yes">advice</italic> to modify identified risks, and <italic toggle="yes">referral</italic> to support services, providers or groups to provide ongoing behaviour change support [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Preventive care can also include broader elements of assisting clients to change, such as goal setting, motivational interviewing, agency building and follow-up support [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], aligning with the frequent and often extended period of engagement with clients that typifies the support provided by multidisciplinary community mental health teams. Research has found that community mental health clinicians do consider that providing preventive care is an important part of their role [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Despite this, a meta-analysis of 38 studies indicated that preventive care was infrequently provided by mental health services, including community mental health services [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Further, a number of barriers to the provision of preventive care in this setting have been identified, including lack of knowledge regarding risk factors and confidence in assessing them, inadequate time to undertake a comprehensive risk assessment and advice provision within a typical consultation, and a perceived lack of referral options [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Research has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of interventions to increase preventive care provision in mental health settings. A recent systematic review by Fehily et al. (2020) identified twenty studies (of any design with a comparison group) with such an aim [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Of the included studies (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 20), most examined smoking only (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14), with few targeting other risk behaviours (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6). Effective intervention strategies (defined as demonstrating a significant increase in preventive care in at least two studies) were identified within two categories of the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Taxonomy [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]: (1) delivery arrangements: changes in who is responsible for care provision or how, when or where care is delivered (including embedding additional staff with specialist roles); and (2) implementation strategies: strategies to influence the behaviour of organisations or clinicians, or use of health services by clients (including clinician training, educational materials, health information systems, local consensus processes, authority and accountability, and reminders).</p>
              <p>Embedding an additional provider in a mental health service with a dedicated preventive care role is a delivery arrangement with the potential to overcome the aforementioned barriers. The above systematic review identified that this approach led to significant increases in client receipt of preventive care [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and additional studies have reported this approach increased the provision of broader physical health care (e.g., metabolic outcomes, self-examination, and access to primary medical care) [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Both clients [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and mental health clinicians [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] show support for such an approach, though have indicated the importance of it being coordinated with usual care provision and not adding to the existing fragmentation of physical and mental health care delivery [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our first study exploring this model of care—and the only published study to do so with a focus specifically on multiple key chronic disease risk factors—we undertook a randomised controlled trial with clients (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 811) of one New South Wales (NSW) community mental health service. Clients were randomised to receive either usual care, or usual care plus the offer of an additional consultation with a ‘preventive care clinician’ [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. At 1-month follow-up, clients in the intervention condition reported significantly greater increases in the receipt of assessment for all four risk factors (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), advice for all applicable risks (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.019), and offers of referrals to applicable telephone support services (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.004), as compared to participants receiving usual care. The trial demonstrated that comprehensive AAR care for multiple risks was feasible to offer and deliver in a dedicated consultation within this setting, and further that this could be achieved at a low per-client cost [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; additionally, it was viewed by clients as acceptable [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, a limitation of the model was noted to be the risk of perpetuating the problematic separation of responsibilities and roles in providing care for physical and mental health (between the preventive care clinician and other mental health clinicians). In this trial, other than a summary recorded by the specialist clinician in the electronic records, the additional consultation was not integrated into clients’ ongoing care. Furthermore, there was no defined role for mental health care managers to continue or reinforce the preventive care provided by the specialist clinician.</p>
              <p>Therefore, whilst the findings were largely positive, further research is needed to address this limitation and develop the model of care, specifically with respect to integrating the additional consultation within routine service provision, and identifying implementation strategies that can effectively support services and clinicians. Cochrane systematic review evidence supports the effectiveness of various implementation strategies in increasing preventive care in general health settings, including leadership and consensus processes [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], enabling systems, training [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], audit and feedback [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and client activation [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Only one study has explored the effectiveness of implementation strategies in increasing preventive care provision by clinicians in mental health settings for the key chronic disease risk behaviours of tobacco smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol use and physical inactivity [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In a multiple baseline trial (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 19 community mental health services), a suite of the implementation strategies supported by the Cochrane review evidence were trialled to support preventive care provision. The results indicated a significant increase for only one of 16 preventive care outcomes, and it was suggested that the use of generic implementation strategies that were not tailored to the specific context of mental health settings may have contributed to the limited effect [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>To address this evidence gap, the present study will assess the effectiveness of a model of care in increasing the provision of preventive care for key chronic disease risk factors (tobacco smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and overweight/obesity) in community mental health services. The model consists of three components: (1) offering clients a preventive care consultation (content framed around the AAR framework) with a dedicated ‘healthy choices’ clinician (HCC); (2) embedding information regarding client chronic disease risks into the existing care management plan; and (3) the continued provision of preventive care by mental health clinicians in ongoing consultations. Strategies to support the implementation of the model of care draw on evidence-based implementation strategies [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], tailored to the service settings through co-development with managers and clinicians to consider the clinical, professional and organisational factors of community mental health service delivery. The primary outcomes are client-reported receipt of preventive care (elements within the AAR framework). Client risk factors and attempts to change risk factors, confidence, and readiness to change are assessed as secondary outcomes. Cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be quantified.</p>

A type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness design will be employed, combining both preventive care delivery outcomes and client behaviour change outcomes [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Twelve services providing community-based mental health care to adults with a range of mental health conditions will take part, across three local health districts (LHDs) in NSW Australia (encompassing major city, regional and remote areas) [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Mental health care within these services is generally provided to clients through consultations (of varying number and frequency) with an allocated clinician. Mental health teams are multidisciplinary, and mental health clinicians can be from a variety of disciplines, including psychiatrists, mental health nurses, and allied health staff. In NSW, Australia, state-level policy requires all such services to provide preventive care to address clients’ chronic disease risk factors; however, previous research in parts of this region have found this care is infrequently provided [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
                <p>Services will be randomised (1:1) to either a 9-month intervention to build their capacity to provide preventive care (comprising the model of care and implementation support strategies) or a usual care control condition. Assessment of preventive care receipt will occur through two independent cross-sectional client telephone surveys, at baseline (primary outcomes) and follow-up (post-intervention). A nested ‘cohort follow-up’ at post-intervention, involving a random sub-sample of clients who participated in the baseline survey, will be used to evaluate client behaviour change outcomes (secondary outcomes; see <xref rid="ijerph-19-03119-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> for study design). Online surveys with mental health clinicians will also be conducted at baseline and follow-up to measure clinician provision of preventive care, implementation process measures (follow-up intervention group only), and resources available to provide preventive care. Intervention and data collection recording tools will capture the adaptations made to the intervention, including any in response to COVID-19. Data will inform an assessment of the intervention cost and cost-effectiveness.</p>

Within two LHDs, smaller sites that came under one overarching manager were treated as one service for this trial (considered multisite services). In the other LHD, it was not possible to ensure that different services had unique managers, as two managers oversee staff across multiple locations, including both intervention and control services.

The tailoring of the model of care and implementation strategies will occur predominantly at the LHD level (e.g., how/where information about client risk factors will be embedded into the existing care management plan); however, some tailoring may be necessary at the service level due to unique service characteristics (e.g., delivery of clinician training within existing training opportunities that are unique to each service).

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>Recommended preventive care to address chronic disease risk behaviours is infrequently provided by community mental health services. This protocol described the rationale and design of a trial that aimed to determine the effectiveness of a clinical practice change intervention to increase the guideline-concordant delivery of preventive care in community mental health services. The study is one of few aiming to do so with a focus on multiple key chronic disease risk behaviours [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the first to test the proposed novel model of care. The results of the trial will provide important information regarding the effectiveness and cost of an intervention to build the capacity of community mental health services to implement evidence-based preventive care for their clients. </p>
              <p>The model of care involves offering clients an additional consultation with a ‘healthy choices’ clinician, embedding information regarding chronic disease risk behaviours into existing care management plans, and continued provision of preventive care by mental health clinicians. This model was developed based on evidence for the effectiveness [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and cost efficiency [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] of embedding a dedicated preventive care provider in community mental health services, and the acknowledgement that such a dedicated role needs to be integrated with usual mental health care delivery [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The implementation of this model of care will be supported by implementation strategies, selected based on Cochrane systematic review evidence for their effectiveness in supporting implementation of health care delivery [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Previous research by our team suggests that tailoring these strategies to the specific context of mental health settings may increase their effectiveness [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>The findings add to the limited literature regarding interventions to support the delivery of preventive care for multiple chronic disease risk behaviours. This knowledge will inform the development of future service delivery initiatives to achieve guideline- and policy-concordant preventive care delivery.</p>
              <p>This study has some limitations. Firstly, the recruitment method for the client surveys relies on mail and telephone. This may preclude some people from participating, for example, people who do not have access to a telephone. Secondly, the primary outcomes (client self-reported receipt of preventive care) are subject to sampling and recall bias. The inclusion of additional process outcomes (e.g., staff-reported provision of preventive care; HCC records) will enhance reporting. Providing such preventive care has the potential to improve both physical and mental health outcomes for this population group, with evidence that positive changes to risk behaviours can lead to improved mental health and mental wellbeing [<xref rid="B56-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijerph-19-03119" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>

              <title>4. Conclusions</title>
              <p>The proposed study will increase knowledge regarding effective initiatives to support routine preventive care delivery within community mental health services. Identifying effective population-level approaches to reducing the high prevalence of chronic disease risk factors for people with a mental health condition has the potential to prevent chronic disease development and to improve the life expectancy and quality of life of this vulnerable population group.</p>
