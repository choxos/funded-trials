                <title>Abstract</title>
                <p>The Diabetes and Antenatal Milk Expressing (DAME) randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in 2011–2015, at six sites in Melbourne, Australia to explore the effect of advising women with diabetes in pregnancy to express breast milk from 36 weeks gestation. Infants whose mothers were randomised to express in pregnancy were more likely to be exclusively breast milk fed during their hospital stay, and there was no evidence of harm. This paper explores women's views and experiences of antenatal expressing. In this two‐arm RCT, 635 women with diabetes in pregnancy who were otherwise of low medical risk were randomised at 36–37 weeks gestation to usual care (not expressing, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 316), or the intervention, where women were advised to hand express for 10 min twice daily until birth (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 319). Semistructured face‐to‐face interviews were conducted with 10 women who expressed antenatally. They were asked about their experiences of antenatal expressing, including how they felt about the overall experience, the amount of breast milk they expressed, making time to express, and their experience of breastfeeding. Thematic analysis of the in‐depth interviews identified six themes: (1) learning and adapting expressing, (2) feelings and sensations associated with expressing, (3) support, (4) dis/empowerment, (5) health, and (6) the value of breast milk. Women had both positive and negative experiences of antenatal expressing. If health professionals are advising antenatal expressing to women, it is important they understand the range of outcomes and experiences.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>The World Health Organization (<xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) recommends breastfeeding for 6 months exclusively and continued breastfeeding combined with solid foods for up to 2 years or beyond. However, for some women this is more challenging. Women with diabetes in pregnancy—which includes 13% of pregnant women in Australia (Australian Institute for Health and Welfare, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)—and their infants are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy and birth (HAPO Study Cooperative Research Group et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). These complications can be a barrier to successful breastfeeding (Patil et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Women with diabetes in pregnancy are at increased risk of delayed lactogenesis II (De Bortoli &amp; Amir, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), are less likely to breastfeed exclusively (Oza‐Frank et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and have a shorter duration of breastfeeding (Nguyen et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), breastfeeding confers significant maternal metabolic benefits and delays the possible onset of type 2 diabetes (Aune et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Infants of women with diabetes in pregnancy have a high risk of hypoglycaemia (Mitanchez et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which along with the possible maternal delayed lactogenesis II (De Bortoli &amp; Amir, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), leads to mother‐infant separation, infant formula supplementation and shorter breastfeeding duration (Baerug et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). As a result, many pregnant women with diabetes are being advised to express breast milk in the last weeks of pregnancy, to have a supply of expressed breast milk (EBM) to prevent or treat neonatal hypoglycaemia, and avoid infant formula and/or admission of baby to a neonatal unit (NHS Worchestershire Acute Hospitals, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Women's Health Auckland, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>Postnatal expressing is common when women are separated from their babies, when they return to paid employment (Johns et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), or if babies are unable to feed directly from the breast (Keim et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The research on methods of milk expression for lactating women is predominantly breast pump industry‐funded and focused on the amount and content of breast milk, and speed and ease of expressing (Becker et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A systematic review of the prevalence and outcomes of expressing by Johns et al. (<xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) found limited research about women's experience of expressing.</p>
              <p>More recently, studies of antenatal expressing in Australia (Brisbane &amp; Giglia, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Casey, Mogg, et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Forster et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), the United Kingdom (Fair et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), and the United States (Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) have included some exploration of women's experiences. Positive experiences include feelings of increased breastfeeding preparedness or confidence, and that having breast milk provided a sense of security or satisfaction (Brisbane &amp; Giglia, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Forster et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Negative experiences include feelings of breast tenderness or pain, difficulty with expressing (Brisbane &amp; Giglia, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Forster et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and embarrassment and concerns about privacy (Brisbane &amp; Giglia, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Other experiences include feelings of futility (Brisbane &amp; Giglia, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Casey, Mogg, et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and pressure to succeed (Casey, Banks, et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), feeling anxious about not getting ‘enough’ breast milk, and difficulty finding time to express (Forster et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Practical issues were identified, including lack of storage space, wastage of EBM (Casey, Mogg, et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and perceived lack of support by hospital staff (Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>The Diabetes and Antenatal Milk Expressing (DAME) multisite randomised controlled trial conducted in Melbourne, Australia between 2011 and 2016, tested the practice of advising women with diabetes in pregnancy, who were otherwise of low obstetric risk, to express in pregnancy. While all 635 participants had routine antenatal care, following randomisation, half of the women were verbally guided how to express breastmilk by the research midwives at the hospitals. They were advised to hand express twice a day for no more than 10 min each time and given written instructions about expressing and breastmilk storage as per Supporting Information File 1 of the trial protocol paper (Forster et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Infants whose mothers were randomised to express in pregnancy were more likely to be exclusively breast milk fed during their hospital stay, and there was no evidence of harm. Women in the intervention arm expressed a median of 20 times (range: 1–59 times), with the median total volume expressed 5.5 ml (range: 0–905 ml), and almost a quarter of women expressed less than 1 ml in total (Forster et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>In follow‐up surveys of all participants the DAME trial at 2 and 12 weeks after birth, many women commented on the low volumes of breast milk they had been able to express. Given their comments, the low median volumes identified, and that perceived insufficient milk supply remains one of the most common reasons cited for ceasing breastfeeding (Hauck et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), it is important to explore women's experiences of antenatal expressing, including their views of the volume of milk expressed. The purpose of this study was to understand the views and experiences of antenatal milk expressing for a sample of women in the intervention arm of the DAME trial.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken. Our aim was to describe a broad range of experiences and to stay close to the words and meaning of the women (Sandelowski, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). To account for diversity, and to maximise the richness of data about participants' views and experiences, we used purposive sampling (Sandelowski, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). We considered women's diabetes type (either pre‐existing or pregnancy induced), parity (first baby or not), and volume of breast milk expressed (either higher or lower than 5.5 ml in total). Informed by these criteria, 15 of the most recent participants from two of the largest study sites, were telephoned and invited to participate in an in‐depth interview about their experience in the trial. Ten women consented to participate.</p>
                <p>A semistructured interview guide was developed, informed by open‐ended responses to telephone surveys of participants in the trial. The guide was piloted with researchers who were experienced with in‐depth interviews and/or breastfeeding research. Feedback was incorporated, and the guide piloted for understanding and acceptability with a mother known to have recently expressed antenatally. The guide was used to explore participants' overall experience of antenatal expressing, but also included prompt questions about specific aspects of expressing. Women were also encouraged to discuss any aspect of antenatal expressing important to them. Being an iterative process, two questions were added after the first three interviews—one about using a breast pump antenatally, and one exploring participants' impressions of what their family or friends thought about their expressing (Table <xref rid="mcn13307-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>Interviews were conducted between March and December 2017, at which time the women's babies were between 17 and 47 months of age (median 24 months). A plain language statement and consent form were emailed to women and a consent form signed before interview. Participants were interviewed face‐to‐face at a time and place suitable for them, such as their home, shopping centre or workplace. One interview was conducted by video conference. All interviews were conducted by the lead author. The research team reviewed the data after the third and ninth interviews. No new ideas were elicited from the tenth participant, so we did not seek further women to interview. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and field notes were taken by the researcher at the time of interview. The average length of interview was 36 min (range: 19–53 min).</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Thematic analysis was conducted to identify, analyse, and generate themes from the data (Attride‐Stirling, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Sandelowski, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The process of inductive coding was used, to stay close to intent of the thoughts and words of the participants (Braun &amp; Clarke, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Saldana, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). All transcripts were read and checked against the audio files and reread for understanding and immersion in the data. Initially, three transcripts were independently coded by authors A.M., L.A. and S.C. and were reviewed and discussed for consistency of code identification. A further two transcripts were coded by A.M. and S.C. to confirm coding consistency and the remaining transcripts were coded by A.M. All the transcribed verbatim interview data were given codes and were then organised into broader categories and themes. During the identification and development of the codes and categories, there was extensive discussion between the primary coder and other research members. Where required, the research team reviewed the original transcripts, researcher field notes and some audio‐recordings to check meaning and facilitate agreement. Finally, all categories, themes and interpretation of the data were discussed until agreement was reached. These processes helped ensure that our interpretation reflected the intention of the participants and reduced potential researcher bias. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) guidelines were followed to ensure rigour in the conduct and reporting of the research (O'Brien et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p>
                <p>The use of direct quotes used in each theme are verbatim, with the emphasis and sentence structure reflecting participants' voices. To protect the confidentiality and anonymity of the participants each woman was assigned a number (e.g., P1).</p>

The women felt informed and reassured by this information.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p><italic toggle="yes">Physically it was nice to be able to have the lactation consultant show you how to do it properly so that at least you felt more informed … Even that sliverest [sic] of information felt, well, “at least I've got this bit”.

                  <p>Women described managing their diabetes as a significant time burden; checking their blood glucose levels, and managing their insulin and meals made it was difficult for some women to find time to express, particularly for those in paid employment or caring for other children. Some women reduced the length of time they expressed to fit it into their schedule.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p><italic toggle="yes">You are feeling uncomfortable and tired and had other little ones, umm it [expressing] was a bit of an extra thing to do.

                <p>Participants were asked what they noticed for themselves or their baby when they were expressing. Three categories were identified: physical sensations during expressing, feelings about any uterine contractions, and privacy and awkwardness.</p>

                  <p>Most women who discussed physical breast sensations associated with expressing referred to minor discomfort to being so uncomfortable or painful that they stopped expressing. For some, the spoon used to collect milk felt awkward and caused nipple soreness.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p><italic toggle="yes">… it's [expressing] like squeezing and squeezing and little bit uncomfortable.

                  <p>Women were aware of the possibility of postpartum problems associated with maternal diabetes such as low milk production and low infant blood glucose levels, so a store of breast milk was considered as security. Yet some wondered if their small amounts of breast milk would be enough.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p><italic toggle="yes">I understand that with gestational diabetes they might come out hypo and need the milk instantly.

                  <p>When asked if they would express again, all participants said they would try, but that they would stop if they could not express any milk. Some had been encouraging pregnant family members or friends to express antenatally, and not just those with diabetes. Regardless of the volume they had obtained, participants felt overall the experience of antenatal expressing was positive, as it had provided stimulation, and they hoped for better milk volumes if they expressed again.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"><p><italic toggle="yes">For anybody that's not getting any milk, to be like ‘keep it up cos you know cos these are the benefits of just the stimulation’.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This study, which explored the views and experiences of antenatal expressing for women with diabetes in pregnancy, has confirmed similar themes in previous studies and identified new themes. Consistent with previous studies we found that antenatal expressing gave some women feelings of confidence, achievement, and empowerment (Brisbane &amp; Giglia, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Casey, Mogg, et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) but that expressing at times felt uncomfortable, painful (Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and embarrassing (Brisbane &amp; Giglia, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Demirci et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Also consistent with earlier studies, women wanting to avoid infant formula, saw their milk as precious and security for their baby's health, and that by expressing milk they were being a good and protective mother (Casey, Mogg, et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Similar to findings by Casey, Mogg, et al. (<xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and Brisbane and Giglia (<xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), women in this study described feelings of frustration, disappointment, and futility if their breast milk was not used, or hospital staff did not value their precious breast milk as much as they did. Some women wondered if antenatal expressing was worth their efforts.</p>
              <p>Difficulty in finding time to express was commonly mentioned in the routine follow‐up in the DAME trial and by Demirci et al. (<xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), so was included in the interview guide. Some of the participants had expressed antenatally again since the trial and described finding time to express was more difficult now that they were caring for other children and said they ‘did it when they could’.</p>
              <p>Due to increased pregnancy monitoring for women with diabetes, some participants described a loss of control and that managing their diabetes felt burdensome. Yet for some, the addition of twice‐daily expressing did not increase their overall feelings of burden. Antenatal expressing created some positive feelings. Some women felt that expressing gave them a level of control in their pregnancy, in that they might be able to produce a store of breast milk for their baby and hoped that antenatal expressing might improve their approaching breastfeeding experience.</p>
              <p>For some women, including their partner in the expressing experience was positive, with their partners encouraging them, helping with equipment and hands‐on expressing. However, others described conflict when other family members questioned their antenatal expressing. As with the evidence to support breastfeeding overall (McFadden et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), the inclusion of partners or support people when teaching antenatal expressing may support women and reduce familial conflict.</p>
              <p>Our study further confirmed that women wanted support from health professionals at the time of initial expressing education and at subsequent antenatal appointments. Given that they had only had one supervised expressing session, they wanted to know if they were ‘doing it right’. Demirci et al. (<xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) discussed that concerns about breast tenderness, expressing technique, milk volumes or contractions may be addressed with observation, feedback, and knowledgeable discussions. Our participants confirmed they would find follow‐up useful and acceptable.</p>
              <p>Participants discussed feelings of empowerment, confidence, sense of control, and the possibility of increased exclusivity of breast milk that antenatal expressing provided, but also acknowledged feelings of futility, pain, and fear. The women in this study were considered low risk for pregnancy concerns other than their diabetes, so the views and experiences of antenatal expressing women for experiencing higher risk pregnancies, or without diabetes may be different.</p>
              <p>Participants stated they would express antenatally again, but only if they were getting milk. This study found that some women question the effectiveness of advising antenatal expressing for all women, and if there are there ‘real benefits’ for their efforts of expressing. Women with diabetes in pregnancy are currently the target group being advised to express antenatally, and the management of diabetes in pregnancy may be a significant time and energy burden, so the prospect of antenatal expressing little or no breast milk may feel too onerous and stressful for some women. When advising women to express antenatally, health professionals should discuss with women the potential additional burden versus realistic potential benefit, especially in the context of her diabetes and other caring or work roles.</p>
              <p>Consistent with the studies by Demirci et al. (<xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and Casey, Mogg, et al. (<xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) our study highlighted women's disappointment and frustration with hospitals that are advising antenatal expressing, yet not consistently supporting the storage and prioritised use of their precious breast milk. Given the substantial efforts women put into expressing, maternity care providers need to ensure training for staff about antenatal expressing and proactive support for women who are expressing antenatally. Hospitals must also ensure the clear identification and safe storage of antenatal breast milk and prioritise its use when required. With the increased awareness and use of breast pumps generally, health professionals should also be alert that pregnant women may be considering using a breast pump to express antenatally, which is yet to be researched.</p>
              <p>A limitation of this study is the small sample of participants from the intervention arm of a randomised‐controlled trial. Two of the participants interviewed were taught antenatal expressing at randomisation by the first author and it is possible that these participants may have modified their responses. To what extent the participants modified their responses remains unknown. Some of the themes may have been also identified by participants in the control arm—especially relating to the values of importance of breast milk, concern about breastfeeding in general, and the burden of diabetes. While diabetes in pregnancy was not the focus of this study, the women's diabetes management had a significant day‐to‐day impact and was often woven into participants' responses about expressing. Also, the interviews were conducted approximately 3 years after the women had participated in the trial, however research has confirmed that women's memory of infant feeding is accurate up to at least 6 years postpartum (Amissah et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). A strength of this study is that women who have diabetes in pregnancy are currently a target group to be advised to express antenatally and these in‐depth interviews have provided valuable insights into their lives, views, and experiences.</p>
              <p>This is the first study describing the views and experiences of women expressing antenatally with the researchers knowing the volumes of antenatal breast milk. Currently there is no evidence that antenatal expressing promotes increased postnatal volumes of breast milk. A perceived lack of a sufficient milk supply is often the main reason cited by women for ceasing breastfeeding earlier than their intended goals (Morrison et al., <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), so health professionals should be alert to women being concerned if they express little or no milk and be ready to reassure them.</p>
              <p>While research is emerging about antenatal expressing, other evidence‐based breastfeeding interventions must be maintained, such as the global initiative of the BFHI Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (World Health Organization, <xref rid="mcn13307-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), particularly the need for health professionals to discuss the importance and management of breastfeeding with pregnant women and their families. This will ensure the intervention of antenatal expressing complements, but does not overshadow established best practices that protect, promote, and support breastfeeding.</p>
