                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Neonatal endotracheal intubation is an essential but potentially destabilising procedure. With an increased focus on avoiding mechanical ventilation, particularly in preterm infants, there are fewer opportunities for clinicians to gain proficiency in this important emergency skill. Rates of successful intubation at the first attempt are relatively low, and adverse event rates are high, when compared with intubations in paediatric and adult populations. Interventions to improve operator success and patient stability during neonatal endotracheal intubations are needed. Using nasal high flow therapy extends the safe apnoea time of adults undergoing upper airway surgery and during endotracheal intubation. This technique is untested in neonates.</p>

                  <p>The <underline>S</underline>tabilisation with nasal <underline>H</underline>igh flow during <underline>I</underline>ntubation of <underline>NE</underline>onates (SHINE) trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing the use of nasal high flow during neonatal intubation with standard care (no nasal high flow). Intubations are randomised individually, and stratified by site, use of premedications, and postmenstrual age (&lt;28 weeksâ gestation; â¥28 weeksâ gestation). The primary outcome is the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability of the infant. Physiological instability is defined as an absolute decrease in peripheral oxygen saturation &gt;20% from preintubation baseline and/or bradycardia (&lt;100 beats per minute).</p>

              <p>Opportunities for clinicians to acquire proficiency in neonatal endotracheal intubation have decreased over time.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The increased use of ânon-invasiveâ respiratory support (without an endotracheal tube), less-invasive surfactant administration techniques, and the move away from routine endotracheal suctioning of babies born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid have contributed to this trend. In extremely preterm infants, the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for primary respiratory support results in fewer days of mechanical ventilation, less surfactant administration and a lower risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, compared with intubation and mechanical ventilation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Nasal high flow therapy (nHF) is a newer mode of non-invasive respiratory support that delivers heated, humidified gas via two small nasal prongs. In preterm infants, nHF has been evaluated for the management of early respiratory distress and post extubation support, leading to widespread use in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Nasal HF is commonly used in preterm and term newborn infants,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> as well as in children<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and adults.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Current clinical applications of nHF in neonates include primary support of respiratory distress syndrome and post-extubation support in preterm infants.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>While non-invasive modes of respiratory support are used whenever possible for neonates, endotracheal intubation is still sometimes required, particularly for the most immature infants.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> With decreasing clinical experience in this procedure, neonatal intubation success rates at the first attempt are low but increase with increasing operator experience. In a large international registry study of adverse events (AEs) associated with endotracheal intubation, Foglia <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that overall first attempt intubation success was 49% for intubations in the NICU.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> O'Donnell <italic>et al</italic> reviewed 60 intubation attempts and reported success rates of 24% for residents (junior trainees), 78% for fellows (senior trainees) and 86% for consultants.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, the duration of neonatal intubation attempts is often longer than the international guidelines recommend<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and varies with the experience of the operator.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Neonates are often clinically unstable during endotracheal intubation, due to a lower functional residual capacity and greater metabolic demand than older children and adults.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In one study, severe hypoxaemia (defined as peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>)&lt;60%) was reported in 44% of neonatal intubations, and bradycardia (heart rate &lt;60 bpm for at least 5âs) in 24%.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>Apnoeic oxygenation refers to oxygenation in the absence of spontaneous respiration or positive pressure ventilation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The physiological principle underlying apnoeic oxygenation is aventilatory mass flow: in the apnoeic patient, as oxygen moves from the alveoli into the bloodstream, alveolar pressure becomes subatmospheric.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This in turn facilitates movement of oxygen (applied via nasal prongs) down a pressure gradient from the atmosphere into the alveoli. Apnoeic oxygenation is used as an adjunct to preoxygenation in anaesthesia, to prolong the period of time prior to desaturation in patients in whom definitive securing of the airway is expected to be difficult (due to anatomy),<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> impossible (due to airway surgery),<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> or the time to desaturation short (due to patient comorbidities).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>Traditionally apnoeic oxygenation was provided via âlow flowâ nasal cannulae. More recently, the concept of Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) has arisen. THRIVE is the use of nHF (heated, humidified air and oxygen via nasal cannulae) during apnoea. There is evidence that nHF use during apnoea may improve oxygenation and also carbon dioxide clearance, compared with âlow flowâ oxygen or jaw support only.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Proposed mechanisms include removal of carbon dioxide through enhanced dead space washout and continuous distending pressure, which increases the pressure gradient for oxygen to move down. Furthermore, apnoeic ventilation may be facilitated by cardiogenic oscillations, whereby variations of heart volume during the cardiac cycle promote gas exchange by altering intrathoracic pressure.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Turbulent gas flow from nHF, combined with compression and expansion of the alveoli due to blood flow in the pulmonary vasculature, may allow some gas exchange during apnoea.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
              <p>THRIVE has been shown to prolong the safe apnoeic time (time prior to desaturation) in adults<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and in healthy infants and children undergoing general anaesthesia and elective intubation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Two randomised controlled trials have examined THRIVE in the paediatric population. Humphreys <italic>et al</italic> randomised 48 children aged &lt;10 years undergoing general anaesthesia to THRIVE (nHF at 2âL/kg/min for patients up to 15âkg), or to control (jaw support only). THRIVE significantly prolonged the apnoea time (time prior to SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;92%) in all age groups.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> All but one patient in the control group desaturated to &lt;92% within the anticipated time frame, which was predefined as twice the length of previously published age-related values.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In contrast, the THRIVE group had no desaturations and a mean SpO<sub>2</sub> of 99.6% (range 97%â100%). Riva <italic>et al</italic> randomised 60 patients aged 1â6 years undergoing general anaesthesia to receive one of three methods of apnoeic oxygenation: low flow oxygen (0.2âL/kg/min FiO<sub>2</sub> 1.0), THRIVE 100% (nHF at 2âL/kg/min FiO<sub>2</sub> 1.0) or THRIVE 30% (nHF at 2âL/kg/min FiO<sub>2</sub> 0.3). The primary outcome was apnoea time (time prior to SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;95%). Additional reasons for termination of the intervention were apnoea time of 10âmin or hypercarbia (partial pressure of carbon dioxide &gt;65âmm Hg). Apnoea time was longer in low flow and THRIVE 100% groups, compared with the THRIVE 30% group. While there was no statistically significant difference between the THRIVE 100% and the low flow groups, the reason for termination of apnoea was time or hypercarbia in all THRIVE 100% oxygen patients, not the primary outcome of desaturation.</p>
              <p>There are currently no published studies of the use of THRIVE during neonatal intubation, nor in emergency settings in older patients with respiratory distress. The aim of the <underline>S</underline>tabilisation with nasal <underline>H</underline>igh flow during <underline>I</underline>ntubation of <underline>NE</underline>onates (SHINE) randomised controlled trial is to investigate whether the use of nHF during neonatal endotracheal intubation (1) after birth in the delivery room and (2) in the NICU improves the likelihood of successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability of the infant.</p>

                <p>A trial investigator will perform the intervention. Immediately prior to intubation, infants will be receiving either CPAP via nasal prongs, nasal mask or a face mask, or positive pressure ventilation via a face mask. The Precision Flow device (Exeter, New Hampshire) and weight-appropriate binasal cannulae will be used to provide nHF. The cannulae will occupy approximately 50% of the nares and enable leak. The investigator will apply the nHF prongs at the time of the face mask, nasal mask or nasal prongs being removed for laryngoscopy. Gas flow will be set to 8 L/min for the duration of the study intervention. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) prior to the intubation attempt, including the use of any preoxygenation (an increase in FiO<sub>2</sub> prior to the intubation attempt), will be at the discretion of the clinical team. The trial investigator will set the nHF FiO<sub>2</sub> to the same amount the infant was receiving prior to laryngoscopy, and if the infant desaturates to &lt;90% during the intubation attempt, the investigator will increase the nHF FiO<sub>2</sub> to 1.0 (100% supplemental oxygen) until the end of the intubation attempt. The nHF prongs will be secured only by tightening the cannula tubing behind the infantâs head; no adhesive tapes will be applied to the face. Nasal HF will continue during laryngoscopy, and the investigator will remove the nHF prongs when the first intubation attempt is either ceased, or successfully completed (see definition below). The commencement, duration and termination of an intubation attempt will be at the discretion of the most senior clinician caring for the infant.</p>

In the event of emergent intubation in the delivery room or within the first 24âhours after admission to NICU, it may not be practical to obtain prospective informed consent. In these situations, the study has approval to use a retrospective consent process at both study sites. The infant will be included in the study, then consent to continue (retrospective consent) will be sought from a parent or guardian as soon as possible after the procedure. This consent process was pursued due to the known safety and efficacy of nHF use in neonates, and the lack of any anticipated risk compared with standard clinical practice. Furthermore, obtaining prospective written consent from parents or guardians of infants undergoing intubation in the delivery room or the NICU is not always practical, as they may require intubation quickly and unpredictably. The SHINE trial received ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committees of The Royal Womenâs Hospital, Melbourne, Australia and Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia.</p>

                <p>A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) was established prior to the commencement of the trial and consists of two independent neonatologists and an independent statistician. The DSMB will review the safety of the trial at interim analyses after the primary outcome is known for 60, 125 and 180 patients (~25%,~50%âand~75% recruitment). An additional efficacy analysis of the primary outcome only will be conducted after the primary outcome is known for 125 patients (~50% recruitment). The DSMB may recommend ceasing the trial if there is a highly statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.001) in the incidence of the primary outcome between the groups, or an important difference in the incidence of AEs or SAEs. The DSMB will also consider any new evidence that may make continuing the trial unethical.</p>

                <title>Clinical significance</title>
                <p>Endotracheal intubation is a life-sustaining intervention. However, acquiring this skill is becoming increasingly difficult as the learning opportunities for an individual trainee decline. Many attempts are curtailed because of patient instability leading to loss of confidence among neonatal trainees. Improving the success rates of neonatal endotracheal intubation and maintaining cardiorespiratory stability during the attempt is important to minimise morbidity for all, but especially for preterm newborn infants. If effective and safe, nHF use during neonatal intubation can be rapidly translated into clinical practice as it is simple to use and readily generalisable to units with access to this equipment. Results from this study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific conferences.</p>
