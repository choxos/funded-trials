                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) reduces radiotherapy cardiac dose for left-sided breast cancer patients. The primary aim of the BRAVEHeart (Breast Radiotherapy Audio Visual Enhancement for sparing the Heart) trial is to assess the accuracy and usability of a novel device, Breathe Well, for DIBH guidance for left-sided breast cancer patients. Breathe Well will be compared to an adapted widely available monitoring system, the Real-time Position Management system (RPM).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">BRAVEHeart is a single institution prospective randomised trial of two DIBH devices. BRAVEHeart will assess the DIBH accuracy for Breathe Well and RPM during left-sided breast cancer radiotherapy. After informed consent has been obtained, 40 patients will be randomised into two equal groups, the experimental arm (Breathe Well) and the control arm (RPM with in-house modification of an added patient screen). The primary hypothesis of BRAVEHeart is that the accuracy of Breathe Well in maintaining the position of the chest during DIBH is superior to the RPM system. Accuracy will be measured by comparing chest wall motion extracted from images acquired of the treatment field during breast radiotherapy for patients treated using the Breathe Well system and those using the RPM system.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The Breathe Well device uses a depth camera to monitor the chest surface while the RPM system monitors a block on the patient’s abdomen. The hypothesis of this trial is that the chest surface is a better surrogate for the internal chest wall motion used as a measure of treatment accuracy. The Breathe Well device aims to deliver an easy-to-use implementation of surface monitoring. The findings from the study will help inform the technology choice for other centres performing DIBH.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par12">Radiotherapy is recommended for 87% of all diagnosed breast cancer patients for disease control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], but it can lead to late cardiac side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) increases the lung volume and moves the heart outside of the irradiation fields, reducing the heart dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and thus reducing the cardiac toxicity during breast cancer radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nissen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] estimated that DIBH reduces the mean heart dose from 5.2 to 2.7 Gy on average and Darby et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] concluded that the rate of major coronary events increased linearly by 7.4% per Gray of mean heart dose with no threshold. The Darby data outlines that it is important to keep the dose to the heart from radiotherapy, especially for young patients, as low as possible and based on their analysis DIBH reduces the increased rate of major coronary events due to the radiation treatment by 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par13">Standardly the patients are guided to the breath hold level with audio prompts from the operating radiation therapists. However, Cervino et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] demonstrated that providing the patients with visual feedback by adding a monitor or goggles in addition to audio guidance has demonstrated improvement in the reproducibility of DIBH by 95% and stability by 80% (and for variations &gt;2 mm by 35% and 15%, respectively). Similar findings have been reported by Damkjær et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">Several systems are currently commercially available to assist the implementation of DIBH in the clinic. These systems include the real-time position management (RPM) system and real-time gating for scanners (RGSC) system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), the active breathing coordinator (ABC) (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), AlignRT (Vision RT Inc., London, UK), Catalyst HD (C-RAD, Uppsala, Sweden), Exac-Trac (Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany), and Identify (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA).</p>
                <p id="Par15">RPM and RGSC utilise an infrared camera tracking a marker block, standardly placed on the abdomen between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus. ABC uses a spirometer with a valve that is closed for the breath hold. AlignRT, Catalyst HD, Exac-Trac and Identify use 3D surface imaging, requiring in-room installation and/or do not standardly include a visual feedback feature.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Breathe Well (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is a new audiovisual (AV) feedback device developed at the University of Sydney that may increase the efficacy and improve the workflow of implementing DIBH for breast cancer patients. Breathe Well is clamped on the superior end of the computed tomography (CT) couch or treatment couch and uses depth and optical sensors to directly monitor a user-defined area on a patient’s chest. The positional accuracy and precision of the depth sensor has been shown to be within ± 1.0 mm and the temporal stability of the sensor is sub-mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The horizontal and vertical axes of the device can be adjusted to fit the patient and immobilisation device dimensions and the device arm can be rotated to enable an unobstructed patient setup and an optimal view of the included screen when the patients are treated with their head tilted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The monitoring region of interest is selected by the radiation therapist from within the optical field of view e.g. centred on the sternal tattoo and corresponds to an area of a few square centimetres on the patient’s chest. Within the Breathe Well software application a patient-specific reference breath hold with respect to the normal breathing baseline can be measured and stored. The included screen delivers real-time feedback to the patient regarding their chest position. The breath hold target area (gating window) is highlighted and depending on the workflow status the screen (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) shows an orange wait screen or instructs the patient to hold their breath or relax. An optional breath hold countdown option helps the patient to see how long they still have to hold their breath. At their workstation, the radiation therapists also see the real-time visual feedback indicating when the breath hold depth is acceptable, allowing them to control treatment delivery.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The Breathe Well device. <bold>A</bold> Similar setup on the CT and treatment couch. <bold>B</bold> Patient screen with breath hold position visualisation and instructions. <bold>C</bold> Optical feed and breath-hold depth monitoring central chest area displayed to the radiation therapist</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7072_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par17">RPM and RGSC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) similarly have a positional accuracy quoted by the manufacturer of ± 1.0 mm. The RPM system is installed in the CT simulation suite and uses an infrared camera clamped to the foot of the couch while the RGSC system is installed in the treatment suite, with the infrared camera fixed to the ceiling. These infrared cameras monitor a block with reflective dots placed on the patient. For breast DIBH treatment this is commonly placed near the xiphoid process so as to ensure it is not within the treatment field. As with Breathe Well, a patient-specific reference breath hold with respect to the normal breathing baseline can be measured and stored. However, visual feedback is not standardly provided to the patient by these systems, though visualisation of the breathing motion is provided to the radiation therapists. An in-house visual feedback screen has been produced to replicated this real-time breathing visualisation for the patient. In this visualisation, a yellow bar moves up and down to show the anterior-posterior motion. The target gating window is represented as a blue region with the bar changing colour when within the region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). RPM and RGSC are integrated with the treatment machine to automatically gate the beam.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The RPM and RGSC systems. <bold>A</bold> RPM system used at CT. <bold>B</bold> RGSC used during linac treatment. <bold>C</bold> Patient screen with breath hold position visualisation. <bold>D</bold> Camera and marker block setup at CT. <bold>E</bold> Camera and marker block setup at treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7072_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par18">The primary aim of this study is to test the accuracy and usability of Breathe Well to assist DIBH during breast cancer radiotherapy.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par19">The primary objective of the study is to test the accuracy and usability of Breathe Well to assist DIBH during breast cancer radiotherapy. Breathe Well will be tested against the commercially available real-time position management (RPM) / respiratory gating for scanners (RGSC) system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), which has been extended in-house to provide a screen for visual feedback.</p>
                <p id="Par20">The primary hypothesis is that the accuracy of Breathe Well in maintaining the position of the chest during DIBH is superior to the RPM/RGSC system. Because Breathe Well monitors the chest directly, while the RPM/RGSC system uses a marker block positioned on the upper abdomen, Breathe Well has the advantage of utilising a more immediate surrogate of the chest wall position. In addition, we hypothesise that Breathe Well is more user-friendly as it was specifically designed for guiding breast cancer patients through DIBH treatments.</p>

                <p id="Par27">The trial design is a randomised, prospective superiority trial with an experimental (breathe well) and a control (RPM/RGSC) arm allocation ratio 1:1. Patients receiving radiotherapy for left-sided breast cancer will be randomised into two equal groups. The experimental arm will manage breath holds with audiovisual biofeedback from the Breathe Well device. Patients in the control arm will manage breath holds using an in-house developed audiovisual feedback for the RPM/RGSC system.

                <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                <p id="Par44">Training and simulation: The patients will be trained to perform DIBH with the assigned system and assessed for ability to perform a 20-s breath hold (at 80–90% of the maximal lung capacity). Based on this screening the patient will be deemed suitable for DIBH. For patients suitable for DIBH the breath hold AV guidance while acquiring the planning CT scan will be provided by the assigned system. The unallocated system will be set up to passively record motion. The RPM/RGSC marker block is not within the field of view of the Breathe Well camera, and the Breathe Well device does not interfere with RPM/RGSC tracking the marker block. The reference breath hold depth will be recorded for both systems.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Treatment delivery: For treatment, similarly to simulation, both systems will be set up to monitor breathing motion. The patient will be guided with AV biofeedback from the assigned system depending which arm of the trial they have been randomised to. The unallocated system will passively acquire data but not interfere with treatment in any way. Prior tests showed that no interferences and difficulties are anticipated when operating the ‘Breathe Well’ system and the RPM/RGSC system at the same time. If any treatment fraction cannot be delivered due to a failure of the Breathe Well device, this will be recorded. The treatment will continue at the physician’s discretion either (1) using the RPM system, (2) the fraction will be rescheduled or (3) delivered using free breathing.</p>

                <p id="Par60">The sample size was estimated by assuming that the systematic error in treatment accuracy, Σ, will be smaller for patients on the experimental (Breathe Well) arm than the control (RPM) arm. Previously published data for a different surface monitoring system (AlignRT: VisionRT, London, UK) is given by Kanphet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] who found a systematic error of 0.46 mm in the vertical direction. For comparison, Lutz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found a systematic error of 1.33 mm with RPM. Assuming this study will recruit a comparable patient cohort, that any differences in treatment technique will not affect the target motion, and assuming normal distribution of the systematic error in both arms of the trial and independence of the two arms, the F-test for equality of two variances estimates 36 patients will be needed for statistical significance with a power of 0.8 and alpha error probability of 0.05. The sample size for this study was set at 40 to account for an estimated 10% dropout rate for patients who cannot maintain a breath hold and are treated with free breathing.</p>

              <p id="Par90">Successful completion of this trial and positive results of the primary hypothesis will demonstrate that DIBH with AV biofeedback can be achieved using a simple device without the need for an in-room installation. The ease of use of the Breathe Well device should encourage clinical adoption of this technique to maximise the number of patients who can benefit from DIBH. From a patient perspective, access to a system offering biofeedback allows patients to be active participants in their treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par91">In addition to performing DIBH for left-sided breast cancer patients, a possible future pathway is to investigate the potential of Breathe Well for patients treated in the prone position and for right-sided breast cancer patients, where a reduction in lung dose can be achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
