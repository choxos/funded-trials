                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Call agents spend ~ 90% of their working day seated, which may negatively impact health, productivity, and wellbeing. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a multi-component workplace intervention targeting increased activity and decreased prolonged sitting in the contact centre setting prior to a full-scale effectiveness trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">An 8-week non-randomised pre-post feasibility study was conducted. Using a mixed methods approach, focus groups and interviews were thematically analysed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of key study phases, and provide context to agents’ process evaluation and survey responses. The multi-component intervention, conducted in a single call centre, included height-adjustable workstations, emails, education and training sessions, and support from team leaders and a workplace champion.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Six (of 20) team leaders were recruited, with 17 of 84 call agents <italic>(</italic>78% female, 39.3 ± 11.9 years) completing baseline assessments and 13 completing follow-up. High workload influenced recruitment. Call agents perceived assessments as acceptable, though strategies are needed to enhance fidelity. Education sessions, height-adjustable workstations and emails were perceived as the most effective components; however, height-adjustable hot-desks were not perceived as feasible in this setting.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This study has identified unique, pragmatic considerations for conducting a multi-level, multi-component PA and SB intervention and associated evaluation in highly sedentary call agents in the challenging contact centre setting. The intervention was largely perceived positively, with call agents and team leaders describing numerous perceived positive effects on behavioural, health and work-related outcomes. Findings will be of value to researchers attempting to intervene in contact centres and will be used by the current authors to design a subsequent trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par7">High levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) are associated with risk factors for chronic diseases and all-cause mortality in adults, with associations remaining after accounting for levels of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to accruing at least 150 min of moderate or 75 min of vigorous PA weekly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], adults are recommended to minimise time spent sitting for extended periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The workplace is an appropriate setting to promote PA and reduce SB, as typically, employed UK adults spend up to two thirds of waking hours at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Contact centres are a priority sector to target, as call agents have higher levels of obesity compared to customer service and office employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and spend up to 90% of their working day seated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, this sitting is often accrued in prolonged periods &gt; 30 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] – a pattern detrimentally associated with musculoskeletal discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and fasting blood plasma glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Two recent multi-component interventions in desk-based workers observed beneficial changes of 40–45 min/8 h workday<sup>− 1</sup> in occupational sitting and standing, relative to controls at 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These changes were observed alongside significant and beneficial changes to fasting glucose, cardiometabolic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], job performance, work engagement, presenteeism and psychological factors of quality of life and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, this evidence supports the development and evaluation of workplace SB and PA interventions that aim to improve health and work-related outcomes in the 4% (~ 766, 000 adults) of the UK adult population who work in contact centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Factors contributing to low PA and high SB at work among call agents are multifaceted and include high productivity requirements, sedentary working cultures and sitting-based workstations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In contrast to other sectors of desk-based workers (i.e. non contact-centre), however, call agents are less able to sporadically break up their sitting time and move at work due to a physical connection to their computer via headsets, a lack of autonomy over their workload, and/or the need to maintain high call volumes to meet continuously monitored productivity targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is important therefore that the development of interventions to reduce prolonged sitting in this sector take into account these multi-level and interacting influences on behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">While multi-component interventions have successfully reduced occupational sitting time in desk-based workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], limited research has investigated the effect of PA and SB interventions in contact centre call agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The provision of height-adjustable workstations reduced call agents’ self-reported occupational sitting time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and increased objectively-assessed productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] compared to seated workstation controls over 6 months. Similarly, a multi-component pilot study in 16 call agents, which also included the provision of height-adjustable workstations, observed favourable changes in call agents’ self-reported workplace sitting and standing time compared to 15 seated controls after 1, 4 and 19 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

The feasibility of this hot-desk system was explored during process evaluation, as a hot-desk policy was not in place at the company. The computer monitor(s) and keyboard were housed on the workstation, which could be quickly raised and lowered by hand to enable seated or standing work.

                  <p id="Par64">In contrast, during focus groups, several agents reported feeling self-conscious during standing work among seated colleagues, which appeared to negate workstation use over time.

Most agents were willing to continue to have access to the height-adjustable workstations, all agents would have a workstation if offered by their employer, and, all agents were willing to receive further advice and guidance for using the workstation to optimise health (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table S1).<disp-quote><p id="Par74">“<italic>I used to always finish my shift, and I’d have a pain right down the middle of my back, that I haven’t got that when I’ve been using the desk</italic> [height-adjustable workstation]<italic>.

                  <p id="Par75">A minority of agents felt more tired on the days they used the height-adjustable workstations (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table S1), though other agents perceived that workstation use reduced their levels of fatigue across the working day, which was consistent with team leader’s perceptions.<disp-quote><p id="Par76"><italic>“So you get a lull in the day don’t you when you're tired</italic> […] <italic>I've noticed because P9, one of my guys I can see when, if we have a pocket of availability and he's on an early shift by, after his lunch</italic> […] <italic>I need to get him a call through because I can see</italic> [he’s tired]<italic>, but I don’t see that now because he stands up.</italic>” (TL1 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Agents strongly disagreed that use of the workstation had a detrimental impact on their work-related productivity or work quality (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table S1) and there were no participant withdrawals from the intervention due to adverse events. Work-related benefits from using the workstations, perceived by agents and team leaders, included improved projection and tone of voice while standing on calls, which was deemed important as interaction between agents and customer’s is primarily based on verbal communication.<disp-quote><p id="Par77">“<italic>It is all vocal, and like they keep saying to us over the years, “Smile on a call, because the customer will hear it”. The same with stand</italic>[ing] <italic>up, you project your voice a bit more when you need to be assertive.”</italic> (AG14 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p id="Par78">One team leader identified that their call agent appeared more empowered while standing to deal with challenging calls. This was reflected by several agents who described greater confidence and assertiveness while standing during calls, which they felt benefited their call control.<disp-quote><p id="Par79"><italic>“Do you know one thing that I noticed looking back now, when P13 had some of his more difficult conversations the desk</italic> [height-adjustable workstation] <italic>would go up</italic> […] <italic>and he would stand, and I think that gave him a sense of empowerment.”</italic> (TL4 FG)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p id="Par80">“[Using the height-adjustable workstations] <italic>you feel more confident.

                <p id="Par87">The movement champion attended the team leader training session and the first agent education session, yet felt it was challenging to consistently implement their role and engage and prompt the agents. This was attributed to the agent’s varied shift patterns, break schedules, and dispersion across the office.<disp-quote><p id="Par88"><italic>“…for me it</italic> [the intervention] <italic>was a little bit messy because there were like stragglers and people on different teams</italic> […] <italic>that’s the bit that made it difficult to kind of remember exactly who was on it and who you were prompting.”</italic> (MC I)</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par89">Most agents and team leaders felt it was important to have a movement champion, yet, consistent with the movement champion’s perceptions, were often unsure of the movement champion’s role, with one team leader expressing the need to promote greater agent-movement champion interaction.<disp-quote><p id="Par90">“<italic>From</italic> [Movement champion’s] <italic>point of view it would be good to make sure that they’re following through and checking on those individuals, say are you sitting are you standing, how’s it going, because I haven’t seen any of that.”</italic> (TL1 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par91">Agents typically reported little-to-no interaction with the movement champion, and agents who did interact with the champion described how the champion’s prompts centred on sitting reduction and workstation use, over promotion of active break times.<disp-quote><p id="Par92"><italic>“…if</italic> [the movement champion] <italic>come round to promote movement, and seeing P05 and P18 stood up using them</italic> [the height adjustable workstation] <italic>she wouldn’t have said anything because she sees them using them.</italic>” (AG10 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par93">Agents were willing for the movement champion to continue in their role (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table S1) but suggested localised champions within teams would increase the perceived effectiveness of this component (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), provide them with greater support, and overcome the challenge the champion faced with engaging agents across shift patterns and office locations.<disp-quote><p id="Par94">“<italic>If it’s on your team it’s more relevant,</italic> [Movement champion] <italic>has so much else to do, its finding the time to do it when the people that’s they’re targeting are all there</italic> […] <italic>it’s not always easy.”</italic> (AG11 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>

                <title>Team leader support</title>
                <p id="Par95">Most agents were willing to receive future team leader support to sit less and move more during team and one-to-one meetings (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table S1). Despite this, the amount of team leader support appeared inconsistent, and agents identified the weekly team leader meetings and walking one-to-one meetings as the least effective intervention components (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).<disp-quote><p id="Par96"><italic>“…walking one-to-ones, that didn’t happen. I really wanted to do one of them.”</italic> (AG20 FG)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p id="Par97"><italic>“We had our team meeting, and</italic> [team leader] <italic>was like, “Right, guys, rather than sitting down today, we’re going to go outside”. So we all walked and went to the grassy area outside, and it was a nice day, we had our team meeting out there, and then he made us all do like five star jumps, and it was just a laugh</italic> […] <italic>It was something different</italic> […] <italic>before that, I would literally just get up out of one seat, go to like a break-out room and sit down in another seat, get my phone out, probably just go on my phone for like fifteen minutes or something.</italic>” (AG16 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par98">Agent perceptions appeared consistent with team leaders. While some team leaders reported infrequent intervention-related conversations with agents, others described how they encouraged active team and one-to-one meetings, contributed additional information to the weekly emails, and, provided frequent, ongoing encouragement to use the height-adjustable workstation.<disp-quote><p id="Par99"><italic>“For me it was more around meetings, like 1:1 coaching sessions, not necessarily walking them but let’s get up from our desks let’s get up and go somewhere else and it wasn’t always the nearest break out area, it was lets go somewhere that we don’t normally go we got at least a couple of minutes’ walk there and back.”</italic> (TL3 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par100">Two team leaders did not attend the team leader training session, which appeared to affect their knowledge of the intervention and subsequent promotion of the intervention aims to their agents.<disp-quote><p id="Par101">“<italic>I think for me personally from the very beginning, I probably would have liked, I know we said about a brief, but I probably would have liked a bit more of a run down as I was very unsure of what it was that I was signing up to for at least 2 or 3 weeks.”</italic> (TL1 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>

                  <title>Education and training sessions</title>
                  <p id="Par102">Agents perceived the education and training sessions to be very effective for helping them to sit less and move more at work (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Agents found the sessions motivating, informative and enjoyed the social interaction with other agents, with the majority of agents willing to attend further education and training sessions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table S1). Thirteen agents (76%) attended the week 1 session and 10 agents (59%) the week 5 session.<disp-quote><p id="Par103"><italic>“I felt really motivated at the end of that</italic> [training session]<italic>. Like I came out, and me and P21 went for a walk, like with our cigs. We decided to go for a walk around the building smoking, rather than waiting there, and for about a week I was doing that on all my lunch, like putting my headphones in and going for a walk.”</italic> (AG23 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p id="Par104">Willingness to attend further education and training sessions appeared to be influenced by the incentive of offline time at work, as the majority of agents appeared reluctant to relinquish personal time to attend sessions during lunch breaks.<disp-quote><p id="Par105"><italic>“For me, I wouldn’t want to give up any of my time on any of my breaks or lunches to do anything outside what I’m already doing on my lunch or breaks.”</italic> (AG13 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p id="Par106">Finally, agent’s engagement in the intervention and in particular, the education and training sessions appeared to raise their awareness of sitting, PA and the impact on health.<disp-quote><p id="Par107"><italic>“</italic>[Engagement in the intervention] <italic>pointed out to more myself and you as well (P10) and I’m expecting I presume whoever else is doing it, that how unhealthy were being just sitting, just sitting and eating and drinking, because you do that a lot because you’re sat at a desk,</italic> […] <italic>we do need to move and improve things for ourselves.”</italic> (AG11 FG)</p></disp-quote></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par108">This mixed-methods study is the first to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a multi-component SB and PA intervention and associated evaluation, in the contact centre setting. The recruitment strategy in the present study needs refining to promote team leader interest, and avoid organisational procedures that prevent agents from engaging in recruitment sessions. While call agents perceived the data collection procedures feasible, strategies to increase adherence to pre-data collection fasting requirements are needed. Regarding the intervention components, education and training sessions, height-adjustable workstations and weekly emails respectively, were perceived most effective at supporting call agents to sit less and move more at work. The findings provide original evidence to the limited literature on PA and SB interventions in contact centres, and in accordance with guidance for intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], offer significant logistical and pragmatic considerations for future interventions in this setting.</p>
              <p id="Par109">Team leaders are perceived as pivotal in changing call agent perceptions of workplace PA and SB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and are frequently utilised in workplace interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Accordingly, to provide call agents in the present study with interpersonal support from their team leader, all team leaders were invited to participate, with only call agents in the team of an interested and eligible team leader subsequently invited to participate. This recruitment strategy contributed to only 30% of team leaders and 6% of call agents on the target office floor participating. Low team leader recruitment was attributed in part to the timing of recruitment, high workload, and a failure to engage team leader managers during recruitment. Thus, the pool of agents to recruit from was limited, with the agent recruitment rate below average compared to office-based trials (33%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Future similar trials are advised to recruit at the call agent level, or engage wider stakeholders to promote team leader buy-in, which appears consistent with employee perceptions from a previous workplace intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In addition, implementing a compulsory team leader component may optimise call agent recruitment and promote greater consistency in intervention support given to agents by team leaders. To enable this, future trials are recommended to establish a clear overview of the organisational staffing structure and identify key stakeholders to engage with during a trials planning phase.</p>
              <p id="Par110">Call agent recruitment was further impacted by the exclusion of interested participants with a known cardiovascular or metabolic condition. This eligibility criterion is widely adopted in workplace interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], however a review suggests that at risk populations can achieve greater glycaemic benefits following frequent breaks to sitting and light PA, compared to healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Further, the principle of proportional universality supports targeting the most at risk populations in order to yield the greatest proportional health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. This poses an important consideration for eligibility criteria in trials to prevent the onset and treatment of chronic conditions. To that end, recruiting ‘healthy’ individuals without pre-existing cardiometabolic conditions may limit the apparent effectiveness of interventions on such health indicators. It may also limit the generalisability of the findings across contact centre call agents who have an elevated cardiometabolic risk compared to other occupational groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par111">A red alert event in a contact centre results in the immediate removal of non-essential offline time for call agents. Red alert events are unique to contact centres compared to traditional offices, and in the present study, affected the research team’s ability to engage with call agents during recruitment drop-in and education and training sessions. Consequently, some agents’ exposure to the intervention was reduced, which could reduce intervention efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Red alert also occurred during data collection, which made it challenging to collect data in agents. Senior contact centre staff have identified that evidencing the impact of a PA or SB intervention is crucial if organisations are to adopt and implement the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which is consistent with findings in a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Accordingly, researchers must be aware of red alert events in this setting, and work with contact centres to ensure offline time for call agents to engage in study procedures is protected.</p>
              <p id="Par112">Call agent attrition (48%) was largely due to job role changes and absence, with the attrition rate higher than a previous contact centre trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The average annual attrition in contact centres is 21%, with attrition often higher in the first 90 days of employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The high attrition rates observed in this sector and present study will make it challenging to evaluate long-term changes in behaviour and health, wellbeing, and productivity indicators, and this must be considered when planning sample sizes for future trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Agents generally perceived the 1-h data collection sessions as acceptable and feasible. Missing data was most prevalent for the 7-day activity monitoring, and blood pressure and blood sampling, with the latter due to participants forgetting to fast. Adherence to fasting requirements is essential for evaluating changes to fasting glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides, and the proposed strategy of text message reminders may reduce missing cardiometabolic data in future trials. Importantly however, the majority of agents felt comfortable with the data collection procedures employed.</p>
              <p id="Par113">Call agents perceived the education and training sessions, weekly emails and height-adjustable workstations as the most effective intervention components. The education sessions and weekly emails appeared to increase agents’ awareness of their PA and SB levels, and the workstations were perceived as a key enabler for reducing and breaking up sitting time. Similar to a previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], call agents found it easy to transition between seated and standing work with the workstation, with no adverse effects on productivity reported. Adopting a multi-level, multi-component approach appears promising for interventions in this setting and supports an ecological approach to real world intervention design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par114">Consistent with previous research, agents citied various health and work-related benefits to reduced sitting at work, including reduced musculoskeletal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], improved health awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and reduced fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Novel benefits perceived by agents included improved optical health, and improved tone of voice, confidence and assertiveness during customer calls while standing compared sitting. Several agents felt this perceived confidence had a positive impact on their call control, and team leaders perceived their agents as more engaged and empowered when standing on calls, with suggestions of improved productivity. This perceived productivity finding is supported by objective data from a previous contact centre trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and the collective findings suggest that height-adjustable workstations may be effective for reducing sitting time and increasing standing time in contact centres, while maintaining or improving productivity. Future trials should investigate changes in objectively measured productivity, PA and SB outcomes in call agents to support or refute this currently limited evidence, and inform the business case for contact centre interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par115">The observed perceived benefits support a preventative approach to implementing ergonomic aids within contact centres to optimise employee health and productivity. This is in contrast to current occupational and ergonomic policy that requires agents to have a pre-existing medical or musculoskeletal condition in order to receive adapted chairs or height-adjustable workstations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Consistent with a recent review therefore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], contact centre managers may benefit from greater education on the risks of high daily sitting to call agent’s cardiometabolic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and musculoskeletal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and the benefits of substituting sitting time with periods of standing and light PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Changing occupational policies and job roles to acknowledge PA and SB, and, providing support for agents and team leaders to implement strategies into daily working practices, could reflect this hazard accordingly and promote a shift away from sedentary working practices for a significant proportion of the adult working population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par116">Dealing with challenging customer calls was reported by agents as a key prompt to work in a standing position. To the authors’ knowledge, this original finding is unique to the contact centre setting, and contradicts observations in other desk-based workers who, with access to a height-adjustable workstation, reverted back to seated postures to conduct challenging or complex tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This suggests that future contact centre trials can target the high volume of daily phone calls, especially challenging calls, as cues for agents to break up their sitting time. Interestingly, a high proportion of calls in this setting are complaints based, which exposes agents to frequent customer incivility that is reported to negatively influence wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Standing on calls in the present study was perceived to increase agents’ confidence and assertiveness, and supports a recent trial that reported sitting reduction as a gateway to stress relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Accordingly, the promotion of standing-based work in contact centres may not only reduce sitting time, but support and protect call agents’ wellbeing, with further research required on this topic.</p>
              <p id="Par117">Seeing agents use a height-adjustable workstation in the standing position was a prominent trigger for agents to work in a standing position. Equally, low participant numbers meant that agents were often situated in teams of mainly desk-based agents, and similar to findings in traditional office workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and call agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], social pressure to conform to seated work appeared to negatively influence agent’s motivation to use the height-adjustable workstation in the standing position. Refining the recruitment strategy to increase agent participation and locate participants more proximally to one another appears important for increasing interpersonal support to use height-adjustable workstations in the standing position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par118">Consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], agents identified that ownership of personal space, time to change between desks, and specialist equipment needs were barriers to using a height-adjustable workstation on a hot desk. Researchers and practitioners are therefore advised to provide contact centre call agents with individual workstations, as supported by previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Height-adjustable workstations are however expensive, and cost is a barrier to employers investing in such equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Accordingly, future research should determine the cost-effectiveness of workplace trials that include the provision of individual height-adjustable workstations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par119">The ‘move more’ intervention aim appeared to lack consistent implementation in this study. Similar to findings from a workplace SB intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], the movement champion in the present study was perceived to have low engagement with agents and focus on encouraging agents to sit less rather than move more. Further, reliance was placed on team leaders to implement standing or active meetings, and prompt agents to take active breaks. Replacing sitting time with standing may not be enough to elicit desired cardiometabolic adaptations in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], and strategies to increase PA, in addition to SB reduction, are encouraged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. To date though, effective and sustainable strategies for increasing workplace PA appear unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Given call agents have low autonomy over their working practices and few opportunities to accrue incidental PA at work, future trials should explore the acceptability of refining or introducing organisational policies that may facilitate PA at work, such as frequent or longer breaks and greater task variation, alongside greater support and education for agents to be active during break times.</p>
              <sec id="Sec52">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par120">This is the first study to use mixed-methods to explore the acceptability and feasibility of an informed, multi-level, multi-component intervention, underpinned by behaviour change theory, in the unique and challenging contact centre setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The study adopted a pragmatic approach to implementing tailored intervention components to a real word setting, as guided by the Medical Research Council framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The process evaluation and engagement of multiple stakeholders to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the recruitment strategy, data collection procedures and intervention components has provided original knowledge to refine and justify the current intervention and improve its likely effectiveness and sustainability, which will be investigated in a future trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. One limitation of the study is the recruitment of a single contact centre who expressed an interest in the research. This introduces a potential bias towards the perceived acceptability and feasibility of the intervention components and methodology used in the present trial. Furthermore findings are limited by a small sample of call agents. Future trials should refine the recruitment processes as discussed, to optimise agent engagement and explore the feasibility of randomisation to a control group. Future trials exploring this can report on completion and attrition rates across treatment arms. Similar to previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the study was conducted over 8-weeks, with longer term follow ups able to explore the sustainability and effectiveness of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Longer-term trials should consider the high attrition rate and transient workforce in contact centres compared to traditional office settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par121">This study has identified unique, pragmatic considerations for conducting a multi-level, multi-component PA and SB intervention and associated evaluation in highly sedentary call agents in the challenging contact centre setting. The intervention was perceived positively, with call agents and team leaders describing numerous perceived positive effects on behavioural, health and work-related outcomes. The findings provide evidence to refine the recruitment strategy to optimise agent engagement, enhance compliance to data collection requirements, and enhance the likely effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention components. Developing this complex intervention in an iterative manner, in accordance with frameworks for intervention development, has provided valuable considerations for tailoring future interventions to the contact centre setting, and the findings will be used by the current authors to refine and justify the design of a subsequent larger trial.</p>
