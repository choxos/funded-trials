                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>This was a 2-year follow-up study of a primary care-based counselling intervention (weave) for women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). We aimed to assess whether differences in depression found at 12 months (lower depression for intervention than control participants) would be sustained at 24 months and differences in quality in life, general mental and physical health and IPV would emerge.</p>

                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Baseline: 272 English-speaking, female patients (intervention n=137, doctors=35; control n=135, doctors=37), who screened positive for fear of partner in past 12 months. Twenty-four-month response rates: intervention 59% (81/137), control 63% (85/135).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Intervention doctors received training to deliver brief, woman-centred counselling. Intervention patients were invited to receive this counselling (uptake rate: 49%). Control doctors received standard IPV information; delivered usual care.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Twenty-four months primary outcomes: WHO Quality of Life-Bref dimensions, Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) mental health. Secondary outcomes: SF-12 physical health and caseness for depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale), post-traumatic stress disorder (Check List-Civilian), IPV (Composite Abuse Scale), physical symptoms (≥6 in last month). Data collected through postal survey. Mixed-effects regressions adjusted for location (rural/urban) and clustering.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>No differences detected between groups on quality of life (physical: 1.5, 95% CI −2.9 to 5.9; psychological: −0.2, 95% CI −4.8 to 4.4,; social: −1.4, 95% CI −8.2 to 5.4; environmental: −0.8, 95% CI −4.0 to 2.5), mental health status (−1.6, 95% CI −5.3 to 2.1) or secondary outcomes. Both groups improved on primary outcomes, IPV, anxiety.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Intervention was no more effective than usual care in improving 2-year quality of life, mental and physical health and IPV, despite differences in depression at 12 months. Future refinement and testing of type, duration and intensity of primary care IPV interventions is needed.</p>

              <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common issue among women attending primary healthcare services, and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for women of childbearing age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Research suggests that around 13% of women attending a family doctor in Australia have experienced fear of their partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and 30% at some point in their lives.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Similarly, a study of female patients attending general practice in the UK found that 17% had experienced physical violence from a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> IPV is often associated with physical and psychological health damage, including depression, anxiety, chronic pain, gynaecological and general health issues.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6 7</xref> In such situations, the presenting condition may be unresponsive to treatment unless the impact of IPV is also addressed. Furthermore, family doctors may be the first or only point of contact for many women experiencing IPV, and hence are in a unique position to assist.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It is, therefore, imperative that family doctors are equipped to identify and respond to IPV.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref></p>
              <p>Despite the important role family doctors have to play in identifying and responding to IPV, there have been limited trials in primary care settings to guide effective interventions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 12</xref> Reviews of IPV interventions found that most primary care-based trials have been in reproductive health or pregnancy contexts, rather than broader family practice settings, and none of the studies tested doctor-delivered interventions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Another recent systematic review in 2017 also revealed limited evidence to base guidance for general practitioners and family doctors.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Hence, WHO and others have called for more evidence on interventions following identification of IPV.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 11 12</xref></p>
              <p>In response to this need for IPV intervention trials in primary care settings, Hegarty <italic>et al</italic> undertook the weave trial.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Fifty-two family doctors/clinics were recruited, along with 272 of their female patients who had experienced fear of a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months. Family doctors assigned to intervention were trained to deliver woman-centred counselling by offering up to six, 30 min sessions using motivational interviewing or non-directive problem-solving techniques depending on the patient’s readiness to change.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> The control group received usual care. At 6-month follow-up, more women in the intervention group than the control group had been asked by their doctor about their safety and that of their children. At 12-month follow-up, rates of depression were lower for the intervention group than the control group. However, there were no significant differences at either time point on quality of life or general mental health status or safety planning, which were primary outcomes. Only half of the intervention group took up the invitation to attend the counselling sessions, and many of these women only attended one session.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 18</xref></p>
              <p>This paper reports results of the 24-month follow-up of the weave trial. First, we were interested in whether group differences in quality of life and general mental health would emerge by 24 months post baseline. Quality of life is a complex, multifaceted construct which may take time to develop,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and it is possible the initial 12-month follow-up period was insufficient for improvements to be detected in the intervention group. Similarly, it is plausible that it may take longer for overall mental health status to show an effect. Any small improvements the intervention group had made on these primary outcomes by 12-month follow-up had been matched by improvements in the control group. This could have been due to common aspects of study involvement, such as survey completion and reminder calls, prompting positive changes for both groups, or due to both groups accessing other support services outside of primary care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 20</xref> The 24-month follow-up allowed us to test whether this pattern would continue once contact with participants was less frequent.</p>
              <p>Second, we were interested in whether rates of depression would remain lower for the intervention group than control group at the 24-month time point. This would help assess whether the impact of family doctor-delivered counselling on depression could persist over an extended time, once the counselling intervention has ceased. Third, we were interested in whether levels of IPV, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and physical symptoms would be lower for the intervention group than the control group by 24 months. Based on prior theory and research,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> it was anticipated that any external reduction in IPV would take longer to emerge and improve PTSD symptoms than internal changes such as reduced depression.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>Specifically, we investigated whether, at 24 months after the counselling invitation, there was a difference between intervention and control groups (on the individual participant level) for:</p>

                <p>As described elsewhere,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> family doctors from urban and rural practices in Victoria, Australia were recruited (one doctor per practice; between 31 January 2008 and 18 January 2010). All female patients aged 16–50 years who had attended that doctor in the past 12 months were mailed a brief health and lifestyle screening survey (20 100 patients from 55 doctors in total).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Female patients were eligible for trial participation if they spoke English, screened positive for fear of a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months and provided contact details. Researchers telephoned eligible patients to reconfirm eligibility and invite their participation in the trial. Those who agreed to participate were mailed a baseline survey to their nominated safe address, along with an information leaflet and resource card. As described in detail elsewhere,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 26</xref> protocols to protect participant safety were followed throughout the trial and harm was systematically monitored using an adapted version of the Consequences of Screening Tool<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and a harm–benefit Visual Analogue Scale (0=harmful to 100=beneficial). A data monitoring committee monitored the trial’s integrity and reviewed outcome and harm data.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p>Once baseline data had been collected, doctors with participating patients were randomised to intervention or control groups (between 22 September 2008 and 18 June 2010).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Patients were assigned to the same trial group as their doctor. Randomisation was by an independent statistician who generated a coded allocation sequence using the computer random number generator in Stata V.12.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Randomisation was stratified by urban and rural practice location with random permuted block sizes of two and four within each stratum and an equal allocation ratio for two study arms.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> After baseline data had been collected, the trial coordinator (not involved in recruitment of participants) randomly selected one of the two codes as the intervention arm and held the code key in a secure location. All other researchers and research personnel, including those who recruited doctors and women and those who undertook analyses, were blinded to study arm allocation until results had been interpreted and preliminary write-up undertaken. The trial coordinator was responsible for notifying doctors of their assigned study arm. It was not possible to mask doctors and patients after randomisation, as doctors needed to receive training and women were offered counselling.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>As described in detail in previous publications,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16 23</xref> the study intervention consisted of training doctors, notifying doctors of women who screened positive for fear of a partner, and inviting women for brief counselling with their doctor for relationship and emotional issues. The intervention was based on the psychosocial readiness model, which describes both internal and external factors in the process of change for IPV survivors.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 23</xref> Internal factors in the psychosocial readiness model include awareness that the perpetrator’s behaviour is abuse, perceived support from others and self-efficacy or perceived power.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The doctor training was delivered as a Healthy Relationships Training programme, consisting of a 6-hour distance learning package, and a 1-hour interactive practice visit delivered by a clinician academic.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The training aimed to equip doctors to respond to women experiencing IPV and to deliver a brief counselling intervention. It used a patient-centred care approach, emphasising active listening, motivational interviewing, problem-solving techniques, validating women’s experiences and feelings, assessing readiness for change, and supporting decisions. Following this training, patients in the intervention group were mailed a letter from their weave doctor, inviting them to attend counselling sessions. Patients could attend between one and six counselling sessions, over a 6-month period, at no cost to the patient. Just under half of the intervention group attended counselling (49%, n=67), with most only taking up one session.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 18</xref> In both intervention and control groups, doctors received a basic IPV information pack and ontinuing professional development points and patients received a list of resources with each survey. Women in the control group received standard care from their doctor if they attended during the study period.</p>

                <p>Trial outcomes were measured at the individual level, at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months, using postal surveys sent to each participating woman’s nominated safe address. The current study focuses on 24-month outcomes of the trial, collected from 15 March 2011 to 1 November 2012. Primary outcomes measured at 24 months were quality of life dimensions (physical, psychological, social and environmental on the WHO Quality of Life Brief Version)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) mental health status.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Secondary outcomes were IPV caseness (score ≥7 on the Composite Abuse Scale),<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> depression and anxiety caseness (score ≥8 on the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale),<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> PTSD caseness (score ≥50 on the PTSD Check List-Civilian version; this cut-off score has shown sound sensitivity and specificity in previous studies)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref>; physical symptoms caseness (sum ≥6 in last month) and SF-12 physical health status.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>

                <p>We calculated that a minimum sample size of 136 women from 34 doctors (four women per doctor) would be needed to detect the prespecified effect size of half an SD difference on primary outcomes, with 80% power (α=5%, two-sided test).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This was based on a two-sample t-test, allowing for a design effect of 1.08, due to clustering.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Further details on sample size calculations for initial screening and recruitment phases are published elsewhere.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> It was anticipated that around 60% out of the 272 trial participants would return their 24-month survey, and thus the required sample size would be exceeded.</p>
                <p>Analyses were performed in Stata V.12,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> using mixed effects linear regression for continuous outcomes and mixed effects logistic regression for binary outcomes, with robust standard errors.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Study group was fitted as a fixed effect and change over time from baseline as a random effect. Analyses adjusted for location (rural vs urban) and clustering of data by practice and were conducted according to intention-to-treat principles. All available data were included from all participants who had completed baseline, regardless of whether they had completed all follow-up time points, and for intervention group participants, regardless of whether they had attended the counselling intervention. In order to assess whether uptake of the intervention affected 24-month findings, supplementary subgroup analyses were performed which excluded intervention group participants who had not attended the counselling intervention.</p>

              <p>The current analyses reported on findings from the weave trial at 24-month follow-up. As had been found at 12-month follow-up,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups on the primary outcomes of quality of life or overall mental health status. For both groups, quality of life and mental health status remained stable from 12 months to 24 months, having improved in both groups between baseline and 12 months.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> There were no significant differences between groups on depression caseness at 24 months, despite this difference being present at 12 months. There were also no differences between groups on physical health status or symptoms, nor on caseness for anxiety, PTSD or IPV at 24 months. Instead, by 24-month follow-up both groups showed lower rates of anxiety and IPV than they had at baseline, although the proportion of women experiencing poor mental health, physical health and IPV remained at concerning levels.</p>
              <p>Strengths and limitations of the weave trial have been discussed in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 18 26</xref> To the authors’ knowledge, this study remains the only trial to date of an IPV intervention delivered directly by family doctors to their female patients in primary care.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Other strengths included low risk of bias arising from the randomisation process; using doctors (and their practice) as the unit of randomisation, to minimise risk of contamination; low rate of active withdrawals; and no differences between the arms in terms of missing data or drop-outs. The management of safety was also a strength, for example, our systematic monitoring of participant safety. Retention rates met prespecified requirements, and were high for this field of research, with multiple retention strategies in place including follow-up contact, participant newsletters, and allowing participants to nominate multiple safe addresses and preferred contact times. Outcome assessment was by self-report; notwithstanding this, few IPV trials have included 24-month follow-up, and none that involve family doctor interventions.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> One constraint of the weave trial, common to the delivery of trials across the field, was that masking of doctors and patients was not possible, due to the nature of the trial.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Also, sample characteristics may restrict generalisability of findings to other similar populations and settings. Patients who returned the initial screening survey were more likely to be employed, born in Australia and have completed secondary schooling than the Australian female population; further, women not fluent in English were excluded from the sample.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Young women (ie, between 16 and 29 years of age) were under-represented in the sample. Also, the rate of female family doctors was higher for the weave trial than for Australian family doctors in general, although their communication skill levels were similar to other family doctors and few had prior training in IPV.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>One key challenge in the weave trial was the low uptake of the brief counselling intervention, and the limited number of sessions attended by those who did take up this offer.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 18</xref> Similar challenges with engaging women in an intervention have also been experienced in previous trials.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Interview data as part of a weave process evaluation identified several barriers that prevented some women attending services when offered.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These included the belief that family doctors only treat physical problems, perceptions around time pressures that family doctors face, and fears about managing emotional aspects of the session (eg, fear of breaking down in tears or not knowing where to start). Poor emotional health or embarrassment about emotional health status also made it difficult for some women to attend appointments. Quantitative analyses showed that those who did not attend the counselling intervention were more likely to be in a current relationship and rated their weave doctor’s communication skills at a lower level than those who did attend.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Future trials may need to focus further on addressing these potential barriers.</p>
              <p>With regard to depression, the current findings suggest that family doctor-delivered, brief counselling for IPV is only more effective than usual care within a year of being implemented. In the longer term, after cessation of counselling, differences between groups on depression are not maintained. Further research is needed to test whether the difference between intervention and control groups on depression found at 12 months could persist in the longer term if counselling was better attended or offered at additional time points, for example, in year 2. The current findings also suggest that brief counselling is no more effective than usual care in improving quality of life, general mental or physical health, anxiety, PTSD and abuse levels for IPV survivors at 24 months. Again, the low uptake of counselling may have contributed to these null findings, or, alternatively these complex outcomes may require more multifaceted, long-term interventions. It may be that the study did not take sufficient account of the extent to which survivors need different interventions at different points in their journey, which extend beyond the theoretical approaches adopted in the current model of weave. For example, there will be considerable variation across IPV survivors within a primary care sample in terms of psychological, safety, advocacy and children’s needs depending on whether violence is ongoing; the nature, frequency and severity of the violence; the presence of trauma symptoms; past exposure to abuse; and available support networks.</p>
              <p>Another important consideration is that by the 24-month time point, both groups had improved on all outcomes except depression and SF-12 physical health status (PTSD and number of physical health symptoms were not measured at baseline). As outlined earlier, it is possible that initial improvements could have been due to study-related influences experienced by both groups, such as survey completion and participant reminders.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 20</xref> If so, this could have attenuated the intervention effect. Despite these improvements, the burden of disease remained high at this 2 years time point. Many of the women still experienced IPV by a partner or ex-partner and had significant mental and physical health issues. This points to the need for long-term, multifaceted system responses to the complex issues surrounding IPV.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p>
              <p>Future studies are needed to refine the intervention further and assess whether and what aspects of this refinement enable long-term effects. Key areas to target include uptake, duration and intensity of the intervention, including conceptual development of interventions for survivors with a diverse range of experiences and an assessment of patient’s readiness and ability to take up the intervention. With regard to uptake, barriers and facilitators identified as part of the weave process evaluation could be used as a guide for increasing uptake in future studies.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Some women’s concerns about attending primary care may be alleviated through messaging that family doctors are open and trained to address emotional and social issues, improving the communication skills of doctors and providing more time through continuity of care. Duration of the intervention could be increased, for example by inviting participants for periodic follow-up or ‘booster’ counselling sessions after the initial round of counselling sessions. Training of doctors could further emphasise strategies to continue ongoing support and monitoring of patient progress, beyond the initial intervention phase. Further IPV trials with greater diversity including more young women, different cultural backgrounds, Indigenous peoples, and diverse gender and sexual identities are also needed.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this 24-month follow-up analyses of the weave trial found that training family doctors to deliver a brief counselling intervention, and inviting their female IPV survivors to attend this counselling, was no more effective than usual care in improving long-term quality of life, mental and physical health and IPV exposure. This is despite shorter-term effects of the intervention on depression (at 12 months) and doctor enquiry about safety (at 6 months).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Further research is needed to test whether refining the uptake, duration and intensity of the intervention could have an effect on long-term outcomes. We urgently need to test additional healthcare interventions for IPV, including system responses<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> to enable healing and pathways to safety for women exposed to IPV attending primary care settings.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p>
