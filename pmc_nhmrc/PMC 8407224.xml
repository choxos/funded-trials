                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To develop and user test a patient decision aid for people with subacromial pain syndrome that presents evidence-based information on the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery and rotator cuff repair surgery.</p>

                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>We assembled a multidisciplinary steering group, and used existing decision aids and decision science to draft the decision aid. Participants were recruited through social media (not restricted by country nor setting), local hospitals and the authors’ collaboration network.</p>

                  <p>People with shoulder pain and health professionals who manage people with shoulder pain.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title>
                  <p>We interviewed participants to gather feedback on the decision aid, assessed useability and acceptability (using qualitative and quantitative methods) and performed iterative cycles of redrafting the decision aid and reinterviewing participants as necessary. Interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were summarised descriptively.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We interviewed 26 health professionals (11 physiotherapists, 7 orthopaedic surgeons, 4 general practitioners, 3 chiropractors and 1 osteopath) and 14 people with shoulder pain. Most health professionals and people with shoulder pain rated all aspects of decision aid acceptability as adequate-to-excellent (eg, length, presentation, comprehensibility). Interviews highlighted agreement among health professionals and people with shoulder pain on most aspects of the decision aid (eg, treatment options, summary of benefits, harms and practical issues, questions to ask a health professional, graphics, formatting). However, some aspects of the decision aid elicited divergent views among health professionals (eg, causes and symptoms of shoulder pain, evidence on benefits and harms).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>This decision aid could be an acceptable and valuable tool for helping people with subacromial pain syndrome make informed treatment choices. A randomised controlled trial evaluating whether this decision aid reduces people’s intentions to undergo shoulder surgery and facilitates informed treatment choices is underway.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Subacromial decompression surgery and rotator cuff repair surgery (with or without decompression) are frequently performed for people with subacromial pain syndrome<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref>—an umbrella diagnosis that accounts for 85% of cases of shoulder pain (including rotator cuff tears)—but evidence suggests these procedures provide limited clinical benefit. Subacromial decompression surgery is not superior to placebo (high-certainty evidence) or non-surgical options, such as exercise and glucocorticoid injections (low-certainty to moderate-certainty evidence), for improving pain and function in people with subacromial pain syndrome.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Rotator cuff repair surgery is not superior to non-surgical options for degenerative rotator cuff tears (low-certainty to moderate-certainty evidence).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Serious harms (eg, infection) are experienced by 6/1000 people who have arthroscopic shoulder surgery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
              <p>Use of subacromial decompression surgery and rotator cuff repair surgery is increasing globally<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> despite the above evidence, suggesting people may not be making informed treatment choices. In Australia, the annual number of subacromial decompression surgeries performed increased from 3536 to 7455 between 2000 and 2019, while the number of rotator cuff repair surgeries performed increased from 6212 to 12 436 during this period.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Increases have also been reported in the USA,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> England<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 7</xref> and Finland.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Patient decision aids present unbiased information on the benefits and harms of different healthcare options. A decision aid on options for treating subacromial pain syndrome could help patients make informed treatment choices and result in less use of unnecessary surgery. A Cochrane review of 105 studies (n=31 043) found that people exposed to decision aids made more informed choices about their healthcare and had a more active role in decision making, with no negative effects on outcomes or satisfaction.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> For some conditions, patients were also more likely to choose less invasive treatment options.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>By eliciting views of key stakeholders using mixed methods, our aim was to develop a patient decision aid for people with subacromial pain syndrome that presents evidence-based information on the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery and rotator cuff repair surgery for subacromial pain syndrome (compared with non-surgical options).</p>

                <title>Initial decision aid design</title>
                <p>We developed a patient decision aid with guidance from the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) using mixed methods.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> We began by assembling a multidisciplinary steering group (study authors) including topic experts (IH: orthopaedic surgery; RB: shoulder pain; KM, TH, RET and DAO'C: patient decision aids and shared decision making) and health professionals who manage people with shoulder pain (JZ and SK: physiotherapists; RB: rheumatologist). The first draft of the decision aid was created in PowerPoint and based on decision aids for antibiotics<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and knee arthroscopy<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> which several study authors have developed (TH, KM, RB, DAO'C and IH) (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>). Key features adapted from these decision aids included horizontal bar graphs displaying the effects of surgery compared with placebo and non-surgical options (which included injections, physiotherapy, medication and wait and see), icon arrays to help patients understand probabilities, a statement about the source and quality of the evidence, questions for patients to ask their health professional and practical issues (eg, time off work, driving restrictions). Decision science evidence suggests these features improve patient decision making.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–17</xref> Data from the 2019 Cochrane reviews on subacromial decompression surgery<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and rotator cuff repair surgery<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> were used to inform numeric estimates of benefits and harms used in the decision aid. Expert opinion and consensus from the steering group was used to inform all information presented in the decision aid (eg, causes and symptoms of shoulder pain, practical issues). The steering group provided feedback on the first draft before we conducted semistructured interviews with people with shoulder pain and health professionals who manage people with shoulder pain.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Twenty-six health professionals involved in the management of shoulder pain were recruited through social media, Royal Prince Alfred and Concord Hospitals in Sydney (Australia), and the study authors’ collaboration network. Health professionals had to manage/consult at least five people with suspected subacromial pain syndrome per year. There was no restriction on the type of health professional (eg, orthopaedic surgeon, physiotherapist, general practitioner (GP)), work setting or country of practice, or years of experience. Fourteen people with self-reported shoulder pain (hereafter referred to as ‘patients’) were recruited through social media and referrals from health professionals who participated in the study. Patients had to be ≥18 years old and able to understand and communicate in English to participate. There was no restriction on their country of birth. Enrolled participants were asked if they had any contacts who met our inclusion criteria (snowballing). We purposively sampled participants to achieve diversity in age, gender and ethnicity. For health professionals, we also purposively sampled to achieve diversity in profession, years of experience and country of practice. All participants provided consent by checking a box before proceeding to the preinterview online questionnaire that confirmed they had read the participants information sheet and consent form and agree to participate in the study.</p>

In accordance with IPDAS guidance,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> semistructured interviews were used to assess patients’ views on decisional needs and health professionals’ views on patients’ decisional needs, gather feedback on the draft decision aid, and assess useability and acceptability of the decision aid. Participants were provided the draft decision aid prior to the interview but some participants did not review it beforehand. At the end of each interview, participants were given the opportunity to provide any additional feedback or comments. Changes to the decision aid were made throughout the interview process. Modifications were compared with older versions of the decision aid to understand whether changes were useful.</p>

                    <p>Interviews were used to gather feedback on the best way to present different aspects of the decision aid, such as treatment options, numeric estimates of benefits and harms, practical issues and questions to ask a health professional. Participants were then asked to ‘think out loud’ while they read through the decision aid. They were encouraged to say everything that came to mind (eg, concepts that might be challenging to understand, what their eye was drawn to) and give feedback on how the decision aid could be improved. The researcher conducting the interview used additional questions to prompt participants who were unsure of what to say. For example, some participants were prompted to give feedback on the relevance, usefulness, formatting, and language of each section, and the use of images. Interview guides for health professionals and patients are in <xref rid="SP5 SP6" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental files 5 and 6</xref>, respectively.</p>

                    <p>After the first round of interviews (n=12 health professionals; n=7 patients) and several redrafts, we began assessing acceptability with a brief questionnaire at the end of each interview because we felt we were getting close to the final version of the decision aid. A separate questionnaire, adapted from The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> was used for health professionals (<xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 7</xref>) and patients (<xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>).</p>

                <p>All interviews were conducted one-on-one via videoconference due to COVID-19. All interviews lasted between 30 and 60 min and were conducted by a researcher with experience in conducting qualitative interviews (CJ). The interviewer was a female PhD candidate and occupational therapist. Two pilot interviews were conducted before recruitment to test the interview guides. During participant interviews, the interviewer took notes to highlight key concepts emerging from the interview and direct further questioning. The interviewer did not have an established relationship with participants prior to the study commencing. Participants were informed of the reason for the study prior to being interviewed. All interviews were audiorecorded (with verbal consent obtained from participants) and transcribed verbatim for analysis. All participants had the opportunity to review the transcript of their interview prior to data analysis if they wished. Health professionals and patients and who completed an interview were compensated for their time with a US$100 and US$50 supermarket gift card, respectively. Health professionals were compensated with more money to account for potentially sacrificing appointment slots to participate in this study.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Preinterview and acceptability questionnaire responses were summarised using descriptive statistics (means and SDs, counts and percentages). For the health professional acceptability questionnaire (<xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 7</xref>), a five-point Likert scale (strongly agree=5; strongly disagree=1) was used to assess agreement with various statements. We presented Likert scores as the percentage of responses for each category and as means (SD). We also calculated mean (SD) agreement scores for orthopaedic surgeons separately as we anticipated they might have different views on a decision aid for people considering surgery compared with other health professionals. For the patient acceptability questionnaire (<xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 8</xref>), impressions of different sections of the decision aid were dichotomised as ‘excellent/good’ versus ‘fair/poor’.</p>
                <p>All interview data were analysed using thematic analysis; a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within data.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Grounded theory using an inductive approach underpinned how data was collected and analysed. Two researchers (CJ and JZ) independently familiarised themselves with the interviews (via audiorecordings or transcripts), recorded initial observations and identified concepts relevant to the questions asked. The two researchers developed a framework to organise concepts into broader themes and subthemes in Excel.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Any disagreements in categorising concepts into themes and subthemes were discussed and resolved. The mapping of themes and subthemes was iterative as new data emerged so that the decision aid was continually updated before new interviews were conducted. Over 10 iterative cycles of revisions were performed. However, in some cases these were very minor changes (eg, correcting typos, rewording a sentence). Patients’ views on decisional needs and health professionals’ views on patients’ decisional needs were integrated with the feedback given on each section of the decision aid to streamline the presentation of the results. Interviews stopped once no new feedback was being provided (data saturation) and participants had an overall positive impression of the decision aid.</p>

                <title>Participant characteristics and decision aid acceptability</title>
                <p>We interviewed 26 health professionals (11 (42%) physiotherapists, 7 (27%) orthopaedic surgeons, 4 (15%) GPs, 3 (12%) chiropractors and 1 (4%) osteopath) and 14 patients. Repeat interviews were conducted with one of these health professionals (physiotherapist) and four of these patients to explore whether initial feedback had been addressed through modifications to the decision aid. No participant who completed the preinterview questionnaire refused an interview. However, a number of participants who completed the preinterview questionnaire were not interviewed since participants were purposively sampled (n=130 health professional and n=19 patient respondents were not interviewed). Health professional and patient characteristics are in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. There were 15 health professionals and 11 patients who completed the acceptability questionnaire. All aspects of decision aid acceptability were rated as adequate-to-excellent (eg, length, amount of information, presentation, comprehensibility) by most health professionals (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) and patients (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> provides a summary of the development process.</p>

                <p>Most health professionals and people with shoulder pain rated all aspects of decision aid acceptability as adequate-to-excellent (eg, length, amount of information, presentation, comprehensibility). Interviews highlighted agreement with most aspects of the decision aid (eg, treatment options, summary of benefits, harms and practical issues, questions to ask a health professional, graphics, formatting, amount of information and presentation of information) and some divergent views among health professionals on parts of the decision aid (eg, causes and symptoms of shoulder pain, evidence on benefits and harms). To understand whether this tool adds value to clinical practice, a randomised controlled trial evaluating whether this decision aid reduces people’s intentions to undergo shoulder surgery and facilitates informed treatment choices is underway.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title>
                <p>We developed a decision aid according to the IPDAS criteria, used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate useability and acceptability, interviewed a broad range of health professionals and patients, and conducted one-on-one interviews which allowed in-depth feedback on the decision aid. Our decision aid includes several key features recommended to optimise risk communication (eg, presenting numeric estimates, presenting uncertainty, using visuals, tailoring estimates).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Limitations include a small sample size for our quantitative acceptability data, being unable to recruit certain groups of health professionals (eg, rheumatologists, sports doctors) and the decision aid only being developed in English (the steering group will consider cross-cultural adaptation of this tool following its evaluation in a clinical trial). We also acknowledge that individual circumstances may limit the applicability of the evidence presented in the decision aid (eg, age, pain severity, activity levels, job demands, insurance coverage, caring responsibilities, involvement in sport).</p>

              <sec id="s4-3">
                <title>Meaning of the study</title>
                <p>Interviews highlighted high levels of agreement with most aspects of the decision aid among health professionals and patients, although we did find some divergent views among health professionals on parts of the decision aid. Highly consistent feedback included praise for including practical issues for surgery and non-surgical options and a global summary of the benefits and harms of each, praise for including questions to ask a health professional, and a comment that a two-page decision aid would be ideal if it included all information from the three-page version. We attempted to create a two-page version of the decision aid but were not able to do so without comprising useability and acceptability or removing important information.</p>
                <p>Health professionals and patients largely agreed with the presentation of non-surgical and surgical options, with some patients pleased to have ‘wait and see’ included as this aligned with their experience of pain that has resolved without treatment. Most health professionals and patients wanted non-surgical options listed before surgery to mimic treatment recommendations in real life. However, evidence suggests people are more likely to think a decision aid is balanced if options are listed side-by-side.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We listed the options side-by-side, with non-surgical options on the left (‘first’), as a compromise.</p>
                <p>A few physiotherapists thought it was inappropriate to include medication and injections as options and wanted physiotherapy-delivered treatments listed earlier. Cochrane reviews on treatments for subacromial pain syndrome show glucocorticoid injections are superior to placebo and provide similar effects to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and physiotherapy-delivered treatments (eg, exercise, manual therapy, electrotherapy).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> There is no evidence physiotherapy-delivered treatments are superior to placebo.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> For these reasons, we did not action their suggestions.</p>
                <p>We found quite varied feedback on the causes and symptoms of shoulder pain and presentation of benefits. Most health professionals and patients thought the causes and symptoms of shoulder pain were accurate and easy to understand. However, some health professionals (mostly physiotherapists) thought the pathoanatomical description of shoulder pain was inappropriate and used language that could cause fear and drive patients towards surgery. Some health professionals and patients thought the icon array and bar graphs were helpful, which is consistent with evidence suggesting these graphics help people make value-aligned decisions.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, we replaced some icon arrays and bar graphs with a ‘key messages’ box to address feedback that the statistics needed to be simplified and less repetitive, and because ‘fact boxes’ are useful risk-communicating tools.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>We kept numeric estimates in the key messages box due to evidence suggesting patients prefer numeric estimates over narrative descriptions of effect sizes (eg, ‘small’ effects).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p>
                <p>Some orthopaedic surgeons disagreed with evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews and thought the decision aid was biased against surgery. Some believed that, if surgeons selected surgical candidates carefully, surgery could improve the speed of recovery and prevent tears progressing (outcomes not assessed in Cochrane reviews), while minimising the risk of harm. On the other extreme were some physiotherapists, who suggested that Cochrane systematic reviews have underestimated the true harms of surgery. We did not change the evidence presented because it is vital numeric estimates of benefits and harms in decision aids are based on the highest quality available evidence.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 28</xref>
</p>
                <p>Nearly three in four patients thought the decision aid was biased against surgery (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>), likely because the evidence we presented shows subacromial decompression surgery and rotator cuff repair surgery are not superior to non-surgical management.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> This suggests tools for assessing perceived balance of decision aids may not be suitable when a decision aid presents information that counters prevailing norms.</p>
                <p>We included health professionals practising in various counties to maximise the acceptability of this tool globally. As such, some information had to be made more general to accommodate the characteristics of different health systems. For example, we could not be specific about the costs of surgery or non-surgical options as this varies between countries due to factors like health system and insurance coverage. We also received feedback to mention physiotherapists as providers of injections as this is within the scope of some advanced practice physiotherapists in the UK.</p>

                <title>Implications for future research</title>
                <p>We are currently evaluating a print/online version of the decision aid in a randomised controlled trial including people with shoulder pain considering shoulder surgery. However, feedback from health professionals raised the possibility of future trials evaluating different formats of the decision aid (eg, video summary, decision aid specific to one shoulder surgery) in different populations (eg, patients who have consulted with a surgeon and know what surgery they are likely to receive).</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>By eliciting views of key stakeholders, we developed a patient decision aid that presents evidence-based information on the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery, rotator cuff repair surgery and non-operative treatments for subacromial pain syndrome. Acceptability testing and interviews with health professionals and people with shoulder pain highlights this decision aid could be an acceptable and valuable tool for helping people with shoulder pain make informed treatment choices. A randomised controlled trial evaluating whether this decision aid reduces people’s intentions to undergo shoulder surgery and facilitates informed treatment choices is underway.</p>
