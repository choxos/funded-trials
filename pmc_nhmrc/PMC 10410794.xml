                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The BALANCE study is a randomised clinical trial (3626 participants) designed to assess the non-inferiority of 7â€‰days (short-course) antibiotic therapy compared with 14 days of therapy for bacteraemia using the pragmatic endpoint of 90-day survival. Based on pilot study data, approximately 30% of enrolees will have a urinary tract infection (UTI) as the source of bacteraemia.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We aim to assess the non-inferiority of short-course antibiotic therapy for patients with bacteraemia UTIs.</p>
                  <p>Participating sites in four countries will be invited to join this substudy. All participants of this substudy will be enrolled in the main BALANCE study. The intervention will be assigned and treatment administered as specified in the main protocol.</p>
                  <p>We will include participants in this substudy if the probable source of their infection is a UTI, as judged by the site principal investigator, and they have a urine microscopy and culture indicative of a UTI. Participants will be excluded if they have an ileal loop, vesicoureteric reflux or suspected or confirmed prostatitis.</p>
                  <p>The primary outcome is the absence of a positive culture on a test-of-cure urine sample collected 6â€“12â€‰days after cessation of antimicrobials, with a non-inferiority margin of 15%. Secondary outcomes include the clinical resolution of infection symptoms at test-of-cure.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The study has been approved in conjunction with the main BALANCE study through the relevant ethics review process at each participating site. We will disseminate the results through the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases, Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, the Association for Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Canada Clinical Research Network (AMMI Canada CRN) and other collaborators.</p>

              <title>Background and Rationale</title>
              <p>The BALANCE study is a randomised clinical trial comparing 7â€“14 days of therapy for bacteraemia.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is designed to assess the non-inferiority of survival of those receiving short duration (7â€‰days) as compared with longer duration (14 days) of antimicrobial therapy. In addition to survival, assessing clinical cure is important for selected foci of infection.</p>
              <p>Pilot and preliminary data suggest approximately 30% of enrolees in BALANCE will have a urinary tract infection (UTI) as the source of bacteraemia.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> UTI is a site of infection where there may be residual clinical uncertainty about the efficacy of short-course (7â€‰day) therapy for the overall cure of infection, even if BALANCE demonstrates non-inferior survival. This uncertainty may especially apply to groups where UTI therapy has traditionally been considered less straightforward for example, males, catheter-associated UTI.</p>
              <p>National guidelines continue to recommend extended courses of therapy (10â€“14â€‰days) for non-bacteraemic UTI presentations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Data from a clinician survey of the treatment recommendations for five bacteraemia scenarios indicate urinary sepsis presentations are recommended longer durations of therapy than other common sources of bacteraemia (pneumonia, abdominal infection, line-related infection).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Typically, for trials of UTI/urinary sepsis therapy, clinical and microbiological resolution of the infection are recommended as the primary endpoints.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref>
</p>
              <p>To date, the limited clinical trial data supporting the efficacy of 7â€‰days of antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia originating from a UTI pertain only to the fluroquinolone class of antimicrobials. The real-world applicability of this data is limited by the safety concerns of fluoroquinolones which have led to many guidelines recommending other agents for first-line treatment of UTI.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 8</xref>
</p>
              <p>The non-inferiority of 7 compared with 14 days of ciprofloxacin in 156â€‰women, 18 years or older with pyelonephritis, has been demonstrated in a study consisting of younger women (median age &lt;50) mainly with uncomplicated pyelonephritis (90%). In total 27% of enrolees had bacteraemia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Yahav <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> demonstrated the non-inferiority of 7 compared with 14 days of therapy for bacteraemia among 604 stable patients. In this group, 68% of enrolees had a urinary source of bacteraemia and approximately 75% of all patients in the study were treated with a fluoroquinolone.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>A systematic review and meta-analysis on short versus long duration therapy for UTI identified 2515 patients in clinical trials. Microbiological failure showed a non-significant difference between short-treatment and long-treatment. Many patients received fluoroquinolones (n=1638), with a higher proportion in the short-duration therapy group. Within this analysis, the subgroup of patients treated with beta-lactams was small (n=331) and showed high heterogeneity. The subgroup of patients with complicated UTI yielded uncertain results.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A large retrospective study compared the efficacy of oral beta-lactams compared with fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of Enterobacterales bacteraemia from a urinary source. The median duration of therapy for each group was 14 days, so conclusions could not be drawn about a shortened duration of treatment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p>
              <p>Two additional randomised trials have compared 7â€“14 days of therapy for Enterobacterales bacteraemia. Neither of these studies offer conclusions on the treatment of UTI specifically, as subgroup analysis based on the source of bacteraemia was not presented and the endpoints were general rather than UTI specific.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>Our research hypothesis is that 7â€‰days of antimicrobial is non-inferior to 14 days of antimicrobial for the microbiological cure of urinary sepsis with bacteraemia.</p>
                <p>If the main BALANCE study finds non-inferiority of short course therapy, this study will address clinical uncertainty that may remain about the efficacy of short-course therapy in the treatment of urinary sepsis. The varied cohort (complicated and uncomplicated infection) treated with a range of antimicrobial classes will provide evidence to assess non-inferiority in populations including those with complicated UTI and those treated with an antimicrobial class other than a fluroquinolone.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This is a substudy of BALANCE (NCT03005145), an international multicentre non-inferiority trial of 7 versus 14 days of antibiotics for bloodstream infection. The study is recruiting patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and ward settings. The main study has a parallel group, open-label design with allocation of antibiotic treatment group concealed until day 7 of adequate antibiotic therapy. It uses a pragmatic primary outcome, 90-day mortality and does not include detailed clinical and microbiologic test of cure information.</p>
                <p>The substudy does not require any additional randomisation, blinding or intervention. It involves the enhanced collection of background data, clinical symptoms, microbiological data and urine samples related to the UTI. This will allow for the assessment of UTI-specific endpoints in addition to the primary endpoints in the main BALANCE study.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Within the main trial participants are randomised to receive a shorter duration (7â€‰days) versus a longer duration (14 days) of adequate antimicrobial therapy. Full definitions of adequate antimicrobial treatment and treatment duration are in the main study protocol and require that the pathogen be susceptible to the prescribed agent(s).</p>
                <p>If there is a difference in the antimicrobial susceptibility phenotype between urine and blood isolates the urine susceptibility will be used for the analysis of this substudy. If the pathogen was not cultured in the urine sample, or antimicrobial susceptibility is not available on the urine isolate, then the susceptibility of the blood isolate will be used.</p>
                <p>Adherence to treatment duration is discussed in the main protocol. Several factors may impact on the adherence with treatment duration in this substudy relative to the whole cohort. Patients with a urinary source of bacteraemia have a lower mortality and potentially less complicated course than those with other sources of bacteraemia. This may support better adherence to the study-specified durations in hospital. In contrast, due to a potentially shorter hospital stay a higher proportion of patients in this cohort may be discharged with unsupervised oral study therapy. Because of these factors it is unknown if or how the overall adherence to treatment duration will differ from the whole-study cohort.</p>

If the primary outcome rate is 80% in the 14-day group, we require 224 assessable participants (112 patients per arm) to demonstrate non-inferiority.

                <title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title>
                <p>Randomisation and allocation concealment are described in the main protocol. In brief, randomisation using variable block size with stratification by hospital site and ICU versus non-ICU location is known from a web-based platform. To minimise the potential bias introduced by the open-label nature of the trial randomisation assignment is concealed until day 7 of the study. At this point the treating team is instructed to cease antimicrobials (short arm) or continue for a further 7â€‰days (long arm).</p>

                <title>Data and sample collection</title>
                <p>Substudy-specific data and variables will be collected in designated substudy case report forms. This includes enhanced details of urine microbiology results and additional clinical data. It will be collected at three time points. At substudy enrolment data will be collected by hospital-based clinical research staff (background of urinary tract abnormalities or interventions, symptoms associated with UTI presentation). Further data will be collected 6â€“12â€‰days after completion of antibiotics (clinical symptoms of UTI and participant-reported antimicrobial use) and day 90 (participant-reported antimicrobial use and/or recurrence of UTI). The two later time points will be collected in-person (for participants remaining hospitalised) or via telephone (for discharged participants). A range of data quality checks are performed on all entered data and any discrepancies identified are queried with the study site.</p>
                <p>The TOC urine sample is the only protocol-specified pathology sample required for the substudy. In non-catheterised patients a clean-catch mid-stream urine sample is required. In patients with an indwelling urinary catheter a fresh catheter specimen urine (not from the collecting bag) is required. Specimens should be collected as per the standard clinical collection protocol at the study site. Return of the TOC sample is crucial to ascertain the primary endpoint of this substudy. Study sites will develop a locally appropriate procedure to facilitate collection and return of the TOC sample to a clinical laboratory where it can be analysed and reported. The cultured pathogens are not being retained or stored.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>This substudy will be conducted, analysed and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines. The primary analysis will be by the assigned group (intention-to-treat, ITT). This group will be the equivalent of a â€˜microbiological intention-to-treat populationâ€™ as all participants will have a microbiological sample.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Participants who have recommenced antimicrobial therapy between the cessation of trial-specified antimicrobials and the collection of the TOC sample have continued antimicrobials for 7â€‰days or more beyond their randomised duration or have not submitted a TOC sample will be considered to not have met the primary outcome.</p>
                <p>To support the primary analysis, a per-protocol analysis will be undertaken within the ITT population including only patients who adhered closely to the randomised duration of therapy (range 5â€“9â€‰days for the 7-day group; range 12â€“16â€‰days for the 14-day group) and did not have an alternative source of bacteraemia identified by the time of collection of the TOC sample. Participants who have died before cessation of antimicrobials or have not submitted TOC sample will be excluded from this analysis.</p>
                <p>For the primary and secondary outcomes, a 95% CI will be used to assess non-inferiority using the 15% margin. For the exploratory outcomes, a Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test will be used to test for differences between groups.</p>
                <p>Subgroup analyses will be performed for principal class of antimicrobial therapy (fluoroquinolone; beta-lactam Â± BLI), defined as participants who have received â‰¤72â€‰hours of effective therapies from an alternate class of antimicrobial; complicated UTI defined as presence of indwelling catheter, urinary retention, urinary obstruction (nephrolithiasis or other causes), a neurogenic bladder (&gt;100â€‰mL after voiding); participant sex; key pathogen groups (<italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>; Gram-negative bacilli excluding <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>). These subgroups encompass pathogens (Gram-negative bacilli other than <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>) and populations (complicated UTI; male sex) who have traditionally demonstrated a relatively lower rate of cure in clinical trials of therapy for UTI.</p>
                <p>Changes since clinical trial registration of the protocol are the inclusion of participants who do not submit a TOC sample in the ITT population and modification of the â€˜per-protocolâ€™ time window for the 7-day group (previously 6â€“8 days), to align with the main study ITT population. Additionally, the subgroup analyses have been simplified.</p>

                  <title>Full balance cohort analysis</title>
                  <p>To supplement and contextualise the substudy, an analysis of all participants in the BALANCE study with a urinary tract source of bacteraemia will be undertaken. Participants will be included if they meet inclusion criteria 1 and 2 in this protocol (ie, the urinary tract is recorded as the â€˜most likelyâ€™ source of infection and no other recorded â€˜probableâ€™ source is reported). Inclusion criteria 3 and the substudy exclusion criteria will not be applied as relevant information is not recorded for all participants (urine cell-counts and specific details on the urinary tract are only recorded for participants in this substudy).</p>
                  <p>The primary outcome will be the â€˜absence of indicators of recurrent UTIâ€™ occurring within 14 days after cessation of study antimicrobials. This will be indicated by the absence of: (1) recommencement of antimicrobial therapy; (2) positive cultures from the urinary tract, bloodstream or another sterile site, with the same pathogen as the index blood culture; 3) readmission to hospital (for those discharged).</p>
                  <p>ITT, per-protocol (excluding the requirement for a TOC sample) and subgroup analysis will be undertaken as outlined for this substudy. Sensitivity analysis will be undertaken (1) including only participants who can meet substudy inclusion criteria 3 and (2) on the different components of primary outcome. All analyses will be based on Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test.</p>

Each site will define a locally appropriate process for this. If the TOC sample yields a positive culture, with any pathogen, the responsible clinician will assess the need for further antimicrobial therapy and/or additional clinical review required. If antimicrobial therapy is recommenced based on the results of the TOC sample this will be recorded as a protocol deviation as specified in the main protocol.</p>
