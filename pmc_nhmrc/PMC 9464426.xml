                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There is an unmet need for treatments for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Effusion-synovitis is a common inflammatory phenotype of knee OA and predicts knee pain and structural degradation. Anti-inflammatory therapies, such as diacerein, may be effective for this phenotype. While diacerein is recommended for alleviating pain in OA patients, evidence for its effectiveness is inconsistent, possibly because studies have not targeted patients with an inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, we will conduct a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled double-blind trial to determine the effect of diacerein on changes in knee pain and effusion-synovitis over 24 weeks in patients with knee OA and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined effusion-synovitis.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will recruit 260 patients with clinical knee OA, significant knee pain, and MRI-detected effusion-synovitis in Hobart, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, Australia. They will be randomly allocated to receive either diacerein (50mg twice daily) or identical placebo for 24 weeks. MRI of the study knee will be performed at screening and after 24 weeks of intervention. The primary outcome is improvement in knee pain at 24 weeks as assessed by a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes include improvement in volumetric (ml) and semi-quantitative (Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score, 0–3) measurements of effusion-synovitis using MRI over 24 weeks, and improvement in knee pain (VAS) at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses of primary and secondary outcomes will be performed as the primary analyses. Per protocol analyses will be performed as the secondary analyses.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This study will provide high-quality evidence to determine whether diacerein improves pain, changes disease trajectory, and slows disease progression in OA patients with effusion-synovitis. If diacerein proves effective, this has the potential to significantly benefit the substantial proportion (up to 60%) of knee OA patients with an inflammatory phenotype.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par44">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent, painful, disabling, and costly condition that affects over 250 million people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current treatments focus on alleviating pain because patients rank pain control as their highest treatment priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite this, pain control remains poor, with &gt;75% of patients reporting the need for additional symptomatic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, despite the large disease burden of OA, there are currently no approved disease-modifying drugs available to prevent or stop the joint damage. OA is a complex, heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes; these will require different approaches for each patient to optimise treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The overall lack of treatment efficacy for OA may be due to treating everyone as if they have the same pathological process.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Localised inflammation is recognised as an important factor in OA pathogenesis and is a catalyst for joint deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Inflammation in the knee joint is visualised as increased signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which results from inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis) and joint fluid (effusion), termed “effusion-synovitis”. Effusion-synovitis is present in approximately 60% of OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and correlates well with histological features of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In population-based studies, effusion-synovitis predicts increases in knee pain in a dose-response manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and is associated with cartilage damage, bone abnormalities, cartilage loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and joint replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, stopping the cascade of inflammation has the potential to reduce pain, slow or stop deleterious changes in knee structure, and delay joint replacement in OA patients.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1α and β (IL-1α and IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) play major roles in the development of OA symptoms as well as disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. IL-1 presents in multiple joint tissues of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], including the cartilage, synovial membrane, and fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Preclinical and clinical studies provide significant evidence for the role of IL-1 in OA pathogenesis, including cartilage degradation, subchondral bone remodelling, and synovial proliferation and inflammation. Members of the IL-1 family stimulate neutrophils, which play a key role in producing acute synovitis in OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. IL-1 also stimulates chondrocytes and synoviocytes which adversely promote cartilage destruction in OA, as well as inhibit the synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen type II, the main components of articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Injection of IL-1 into animal knees results in cartilage loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and blocking its activity leads to a reduction in OA progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. IL-1 knockout mice are resistant to surgically induced cartilage damage and development of inflammation and pain, compared to wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a gene expression study in OA patients using peripheral blood leukocytes, those with an overexpression of IL-1β had higher pain scores, decreased function and a 3-fold increased risk of x-ray progression over 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In summary, IL-1 expression in OA plays a key role in synovitis and is associated with more severe disease, including pain and rapid disease progression.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Diacerein is a semisynthetic anthraquinone derivative that blocks IL-1β, and in vitro, also stimulates the production of cartilage growth factors such as transforming growth factor β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In animal models of OA, diacerein significantly reduced cartilage degradation compared with untreated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In humans, the few acceptable-quality trials show inconsistent results concerning the effect of diacerein in OA. The pooled results from the latest systematic review of 10 trials showed that diacerein had a small beneficial effect on pain and joint space narrowing (JSN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], but the quality of evidence was low. Apart from their relatively low quality, another limitation of existing trials is that they include patients with knee OA regardless of whether they had an inflammatory phenotype. As diacerein targets inflammation, it may be that its effects will be greater and more definitive if its use is targeted to patients with signs of inflammatory OA.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Recommendations for the use of diacerein for OA treatment are inconsistent. Although the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) has recommended diacerein as a treatment option for OA, updated international guidelines from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] recommend against its use, in part because of concerns regarding adverse events, most notably diarrhoea. However, both the European Medicines Agency (EMA’s) Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] have evaluated the efficacy and safety of diacerein and concluded that the benefit of diacerein outweighs its known risks for OA treatment. A chief investigator on the present study also performed a review and concluded that diacerein is safe, has a modest effect on pain, and is a worthwhile treatment option for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, the use of diacerein for OA treatment should not be ruled out due to safety issues.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Therefore, we aim to conduct a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, to determine the effect of diacerein on knee pain and effusion-synovitis over 24 weeks in patients with clinical knee OA, significant knee pain, and MRI-detected effusion synovitis.</p>

We also hypothesise that diacerein will be more effective in patients with moderate to severe effusion-synovitis (secondary hypothesis).</p>

                <p id="Par51">This protocol is reported as per the Standard Protocol Items for Clinical Trials (SPIRIT) Statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The diacerein for knee osteoarthritis with effusion-synovitis (DICKENS) study is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial over 24 weeks. This trial has been developed according to the OARSI Recommendations for conducting clinical trials for knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and a consensus for conducting and reporting OA phenotype research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The trial was registered (Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, ACTRN12618001656224) prior to recruitment, and trial reporting will be guided by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the CONSORT and SPIRIT Extension for RCTs Revised in Extenuating Circumstances (CONSERVE) implementation tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This trial will also be run in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Statement, <italic>the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Guidance on clinical trials for institutions, HRECs, researchers and sponsors</italic>
<italic>[</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref><italic>]</italic><italic>.</italic> We aim to recruit 260 patients with clinical knee OA, significant knee pain and effusion-synovitis present on MRI. To recruit the patients, we will use an established strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], including collaboration with general practitioners, specialist rheumatologists, orthopaedic surgeons, and advertising through local media, social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and University websites), contacting past knee OA trial participants, patient support groups and hospital flyers. Patients will be recruited from four sites (i.e. Hobart, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth) within Australia, and each site aims to recruit 65 participants. Ethics approval has been obtained from the Tasmania Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee (H0017151), Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (17684), Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee (427/18), and South Metropolitan Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee (RGS0000000957). Written informed consent or eConsent (through an online survey issued using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)) will be obtained from all patients by a medical doctor at each site. The consent or eConsent form includes two optional permissions, (1) consent for their medical records to be made available to study researchers from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) for the purpose of checking on any knee joint replacement surgery following study completion and (2) consent to have blood samples stored for future testing and to share blood samples and associated data with other researchers, including researchers outside Australia.</p>

                <p id="Par81">The randomised controlled trial will be a double-blind one, with study patients, assessors, and MRI readers all blinded to treatment allocation. Allocation concealment and double blinding will be ensured by (1) the use of identical capsules for each group; (2) objective measures of knee structural changes being made by trained observers blinded to group allocation; and (3) subjective measures being taken by research assistants blinded to group allocation.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par83">The treatment dose for this trial is diacerein 50 mg twice daily, as this is the recommended therapeutic dose for this drug. Eligible patients will start the trial taking one capsule daily with food, containing 50 mg of diacerein or identical placebo, for the first 2 weeks. This will then be increased to two capsules daily with food, equating to 100 mg of diacerein or identical placebo, to be taken for the remainder of the 24-week trial. The gradual increase in dose, as recommended by PRAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], aims to reduce the side effect of loose stool and diarrhoea caused by diacerein.</p>
                <p id="Par84">At 2 weeks, study staff will contact participants by telephone to assess any potential side effects and instruct them to increase dosage if appropriate. Depending on the side-effect profile participants report during the trial, it is possible for participants to remain on 50 mg/day after week 2 or for participants to reduce their dose from 100 mg/day back to 50 mg/day anytime during the trial. This decision will be made in consultation with the medical doctor at each site. The reason participants can remain on half the dose is that the effect of diacerein on pain improvement does not appear to be dose-responsive. For example, the literature suggests that 50 mg/day has a similar efficacy compared to 100 mg per day (− 15.6 vs − 18.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par85">Research assistants will first conduct telephone screening. Recruitment documentation will be posted to all individuals who satisfy telephone screening. Potential participants will have at least one week after receiving their recruitment documentation to read and consider a face-to-face visit or Telehealth screening. Patients will undergo, in sequential order, (i) clinical assessment with a medical doctor, as well as blood tests to ensure no contraindication to diacerein and a urine test in premenopausal women to rule out pregnancy, (ii) x-ray to confirm radiological disease and exclude severe knee OA, (iii) MRI of the study knee to determine presence of effusion-synovitis. If both knees are symptomatic and meet the ≥40mm/100 VAS inclusion criteria, then the knee with the worse pain and mild JSN will be studied.</p>
                <p id="Par86">For participants who are screened via Telehealth, the physical knee examination will be replaced by a verbal discussion with a medical doctor, talking through the ACR criteria. The study doctor will use the results of the verbal Telehealth knee exam, the participants’ medical history and medications, along with the participants’ x-ray and MRI scans to confirm the OA diagnosis and ensure it is safe for the participant to be enrolled in the study being guided by the current inclusion/exclusion criteria. During the Telehealth screening appointment, if something concerning comes up which requires face-to-face screening, the study doctor can either request the participant attend in person or exclude this participant if necessary.</p>
                <p id="Par87">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> outlines the schedule of assessments.

The volumes of individual joint subregions will be isolated from the total volume by selecting each region of interest (ROI) according to the intra-articular fluid-equivalent signal on a section-by-section basis. The final 3-dimensional volume rendering will be generated using commercial in-house imaging software. The readers will be blinded to treatment allocation and participant information.

Per protocol analyses will be performed as the secondary analyses, for study participants consuming ≥80% of study medication between baseline and week 24 (allowing for 1 capsule (50 mg) per day).</p>
                <p id="Par119">Changes in pain scores and total effusion volume will be analysed using a linear mixed-effects model with treatment, month and their interaction (treatment × month) as covariates. The correlation within trial centres and the repeated measures will be addressed using the trial centre and participant identification as random intercepts. Month will be treated as a random effect to allow different treatment effects among participants over time. Change in outcome measures within each group and difference of the changes between groups from baseline to follow-up will be calculated using linear combinations of the estimated coefficients adjusted for the baseline values of the corresponding outcome measure (e.g. change in pain scores will be adjusted for baseline pain scores). We will also run a model that additionally adjusts the primary outcome for sex, analgesic medication, and depression. Missing data caused by loss to follow-up and nonresponses will be addressed by adding baseline complete variables that can explain the missingness to the regression models.</p>
                <p id="Par120">Secondary analysis for missing data will be performed using multiple imputation by chained equations, with 20 imputations performed by the treatment group using baseline complete variables and nonmissing values of the outcomes at baseline and each follow-up, assuming missing at random.</p>
                <p id="Par121">The steering committee recommended that a doubling of serious adverse events (SAE) in one group compared to the other will trigger a safety review by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). If a safety review is triggered, the DSMB will review the unblinded data, and make recommendations about stopping the trial. A death (or other significant SAE) in the drug group may lead to stopping the study. When the DSMB reviews the unblinded data, they will make a judgement about whether the death/SAE is clearly attributable to the drug, and this will inform the decision about stopping the trial. No interim analyses will be conducted for efficacy. As this is a trial for OA (a non-life-threating condition), no level of efficacy would outweigh SAE concerns. An extraordinary meeting of the DSMB may be called by the Steering Committee at any time if there is concern about the number or severity of AEs.</p>
                <p id="Par122">Based on our hypothesis that diacerein will be more effective in participants with moderate to severe effusion-synovitis, we will perform a stratified analysis based on the size of effusion-synovitis at baseline (mL), and ordinal effusion-synovitis score (Grade 1 or 2/3) at baseline. Other pre-specified stratification analyses will be performed to examine which subgroups may respond better to treatment based on these variables: radiographic knee OA severity, degree of neuropathic pain, depression, fibromyalgia-ness, and co-pathology present on MRI. Statistical significance will be set as a two-sided <italic>P</italic> value &lt;0.05.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par130">We propose a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of diacerein on knee pain and effusion-synovitis over 24 weeks in patients with clinical knee OA, significant knee pain, and effusion-synovitis. If diacerein proves effective in patients with moderate to severe effusion-synovitis, it will offer an important therapeutic approach for this inflammatory phenotype of knee OA.</p>
              <p id="Par131">Diacerein is an anti-inflammatory drug that blocks IL-1β, a key marker of inflammatory OA. IL-1 presents in OA joint tissues and plays a key role in synovitis, and the expression of IL-1 is associated with more severe pain and rapid progression of OA. The findings of previous studies suggest that diacerein had a beneficial effect on both knee pain and JSN assessed by x-ray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Considering the mechanism of action of diacerein, it is likely that diacerein has a stronger effect on pain and structural progression in patients with joint inflammation, as indicated by MRI-detected effusion-synovitis. Moreover, by quantitative and semi-quantitative evaluation of effusion-synovitis, this study will determine whether diacerein performs better in patients with more effusion-synovitis, which may reflect a greater component of pain being explained by joint inflammation.</p>
              <p id="Par132">The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and will affect study sites recruiting for this trial. To comply with the official rules on restrictions, distancing, and quarantines, and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Statement, <italic>COVID-19: Guidance on clinical trials for institutions, HRECs, researchers and sponsors</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]<italic>, this study will apply Telehealth</italic>, a technology of digital information and communication. This is an amendment to the original trial protocol, with approval from the ethics committees. The modifications have been described according to the CONSERVE implementation tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Rather than entirely based on face-to-face visits for screening and follow-up measurements, Telehealth will be an alternative tool in this trial. It is true that Telehealth is not as straightforward as face-to-face visits, but we have set additional inclusion criteria for patients screened via Telehealth, and face-to-face screening is required in the case that Telehealth screening cannot determine the inclusion of patients. Moreover, in such a randomised design clinical trial, patients in both study arms have an equal chance to be screened and followed up via Telehealth. Therefore, we do not foresee that Telehealth will influence the reliability of this study.</p>
              <p id="Par133">In summary, knee OA is a major but poorly understood public health problem with limited treatment options for pain, and no approved disease-modifying drug. Previous studies suggest that diacerein will improve pain and slow structural progression in patients with OA, with the subgroup most likely to benefit being those with an inflammatory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. If diacerein can reduce knee pain and effusion-synovitis in knee OA, study findings will strengthen the use of diacerein in treatment guidelines for OA and be easily translated into clinical practice as diacerein is relatively cheap, well tolerated and currently accessible in Australia and other countries.</p>

This resulted in some protocol amendments, so we choose not to publish the protocol until these were resolved and we were confident the trial was not going to be abandoned. Upon submission, this study is in the process of patient recruitment. Date recruitment began: 18 March 2019; anticipated completion date of recruitment: 31 July 2022.</p>
