                  <p>The main feasibility considerations are appropriate storage for test kits and treatments (in response to temperature and humidity requirements), installation of a continuous stable electricity supply for the GeneXpert device, air-conditioning for the laboratory room hosting GeneXpert, access to a laboratory for pretreatment assessments and clear referral pathways for specialist consultation when required. Lessons from our project implementation experiences included the extensive time requirements for patient education, the importance of regular error monitoring and stock storage reviews and that flexible appointment scheduling and robust reminder system likely contributed to high retention in care.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>An estimated 58 million people live with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection worldwide, 75% in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) targeted HCV elimination by 2030<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>; however, few countries are on track to achieve it,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and 80% of people living with HCV lack access to treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Highly efficacious pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens (rendering genotyping unnecessary) and simple non-invasive liver fibrosis assessment using aspartate/platelet ratio index (APRI) simplify HCV clinical pathways and allow for adoption of a ‘treat all’ approach.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> The ‘treat all’ approach, now recommended by WHO, refers to offering DAA treatment to all persons diagnosed with HCV<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; previously, only assessment for treatment was recommended given the complexities and lower efficacy of the previous interferon-based treatments.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Coupled with diagnostic point-of-care (PoC) testing, these advances enable decentralised care. Decentralisation of care from central tertiary hospitals into district-level hospitals, primary care clinics or harm reduction sites is important for increasing access to care, partly by increasing geographical coverage of care sites. The unaffordability of diagnostics and DAAs and insufficient financing of national HCV programmes continue to prevent elimination<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and necessitate finding more cost-effective ways to provide care in resource-constrained settings.</p>
              <p>Further scale-up of HCV testing and treatment in LMICs is needed, in turn requiring affordable, simplified HCV clinical pathways. In 2018, WHO endorsed eight good practice principles for simplified HCV service delivery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Creating and evaluating such models of care is vital to achieve elimination.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Evidence supporting the effectiveness of decentralised HCV care models and task-shifting is growing, although with gaps in data from LMICs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A systematic review of 142 studies showed that full decentralisation and integration of HCV testing and treatment into harm-reduction sites or primary care improved access to testing and treatment.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Moreover, task-shifting of treatment to non-specialists produced cure rates similar to those from specialist care, across multiple populations and settings.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Decentralised HIV models have already shown how community-based interventions improve retention in HIV care and clinical outcomes in LMICs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> Now, we need operational research evidence to guide implementation of decentralised HCV models of care, simplified clinical pathways and task-shifting. Evidence of such programme implementation and effectiveness will inform the planned 2021 update of WHO’s HCV guideline recommendations for simplified service delivery and use of PoC HCV viral load (VL) testing.</p>
              <p>To assess feasibility and implementation considerations to inform future models and scale-up, we evaluated a simplified, ‘one-stop-shop’ HCV model of care in Yangon, Myanmar.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Myanmar (population 53 million) is a South-East Asian LMIC<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> with a mixed epidemic of HCV, with 2.7% anti-HCV positivity in the general population and 56% among people who inject drugs (PWIDs),<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and an estimated million people living with HCV. Access to HCV care is limited by the number of hepatologists (estimated at 25 nationwide) and unaffordability of diagnostics and DAAs. The national treatment programme has treated approximately 11 000 people living with HCV,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> but considerable scale-up and expansion is required to reach all affected.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Fortunately, general practitioners (GPs) can prescribe DAAs and national guidelines also support simplified pretreatment assessments (no genotyping or FibroScan).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Creating and evaluating a simplified clinical pathway and model of care for Myanmar is an important step towards expanding decentralised primary care-based HCV testing and treatment.</p>
              <p>In this paper, we outline the implementation requirements of our simplified HCV model of care and our experiences in implementing it in Myanmar.</p>

                <p>We aimed to assess the implementation requirements and feasibility considerations for our model of care and potential scale-up. We assessed the feasibility of the HCV testing workflow (delivering PoC serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and onsite PoC HCV RNA GeneXpert tests for VL confirmatory diagnosis) and treatment workflow (GP-led prescription of DAAs).</p>
                <p>To guide the assessment, we adopted indicators (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1A and B</xref>) from Intervention Complexity Framework (hereafter, Framework) by Gericke <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and used mixed methods to collect data on study implementation and evaluation (including interviews with healthcare providers) and routine programme data. The Framework categorises health interventions by technical complexity (the quality and quantity of non-financial resources required to implement and sustain an intervention) to assist prioritising and scaling up interventions in resource-constrained settings.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We used the Framework to analyse the implementation requirements and feasibility considerations of the care model, using all data sources.</p>

                <title>Description of clinical model of care</title>
                <p>We trialled a decentralised ‘one-stop-shop’ model of care for HCV at two community clinics in Yangon between January 2019 and August 2020. Its defining features are a simplified clinical pathway (single rapid test for HCV antibodies, no HCV genotyping, use of blood-based biomarkers only for fibrosis assessment), community-based sites (no tertiary-level hospitals) and onsite phlebotomy and PoC testing for HCV diagnosis, minimising patient visits.</p>
                <p>Clinical study procedures<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and outcomes are detailed elsewhere; for clarity, this study was a feasibility trial with no comparator arm.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> In brief, a laboratory technician took venous blood at patient enrolment; if rapid anti-HCV test (SD Bioline) was positive, reflex PoC HCV RNA testing (GeneXpert) was conducted on-site (no external laboratory confirmatory testing was performed for HCV diagnostic testing). After collecting baseline information and performing a physical examination and liver staging, the study GP initiated pan-genotypic DAA therapy (generic sofosbuvir, 400 mg; daclatasvir, 60 mg) according to national guidelines at the second visit for those with active HCV infection and eligible for treatment within the study. Treatment course length was determined using APRI score, as per national guidelines. Participants with physical signs of decompensation were referred to hepatologists, and those with significant comorbidities to other specialists, prior to DAA initiation. Drug dispensing and assessment of drug adherence and side effects occurred every 4 weeks. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> summarises the clinical steps and data collection relevant to this feasibility study.</p>

                  <p>The two study sites were standalone clinics in residential streets. Each clinic had small onsite generators for power back-up. The Burnet Institute (BI) Thingangyun Key Population Service Centre served mainly PWIDs. It is a two-story apartment, equipped to meet clinic criteria, with a waiting area, consultation rooms, blood collection room and laboratory. The Myanmar Liver Foundation’s (MLF) Than Sitt Charity Clinic is a well-established clinic serving patients with liver disease due to hepatitis B or C infection. The laboratory was renovated 11 months into the study to improve the set-up for the GeneXpert device; see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 1</xref> for photos (laboratory set-up and schematic flow).</p>

Patients were generally asked to attend twice for dispensing after initial prescription (weeks 4 and 8). Staff mentioned that some patients would prefer to attend the clinic for DAA dispensing less often; future programmes could consider removing weeks 4 and 8 dispensing and provide a full course of DAAs at visit 2 to reduce follow-up appointments, in line with national guidelines.</p>
                  <p>Staff reminded all patients of appointments, and spent considerable time following up non-attenders. They reported some difficulties in reaching patients by phone, even when calling secondary contacts. If after multiple attempts the patient could not be reached, then the staff stopped calling but allowed them to continue with study appointments if they presented for care.</p>

When recruitment resumed, it was accelerated to reach the original target; this increased the staff’s workload and stress. Moreover, the four-module GeneXpert device meant that only eight samples could be run per day (the clinics operated 09:00–17:00 hours or 08:30–16:00 hours, unlike external laboratories, which have extended hours).</p>

                    <p>If we want to enrol more patients, like twelve to sixteen patients per day, we have to think about whether it is possible to do that here or collaborate with an external laboratory or run two GeneXpert machines simultaneously. (HCW05)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Recruitment capacity was reduced further when the modules required maintenance or replacement. Typically, five to eight new patients were recruited per day.

              <p>This feasibility study showed a simplified HCV clinical pathway can be implemented in primary care facilities in Myanmar. Previous literature supports the safety and effectiveness of decentralised and task-shifting models of care, but few address operational considerations relevant to implementation and scale-up.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Here, we provide new evidence about implementation and scale-up considerations for simplified, decentralised HCV models of care in LMICs.</p>
              <p>We identified specific infrastructure requirements for successful HCV care, including continuous, stable electricity supply; adequate supply and stock management of Xpert cartridges; ongoing maintenance of the Xpert device; access to a laboratory for pretreatment assessment serology and established specimen referral logistics. The model was delivered by a trained GP; a laboratory technician or health worker trained in RDTs, phlebotomy and GeneXpert; access to a hepatologist for advice on suspected decompensated cirrhosis or complex cases and access to other specialists for comorbidities assessment. These were deemed the minimal requirements to deliver the HCV care model with fidelity.</p>

However, a field validation study in Tanzania<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> reported an error rate of 20% for HCV VL assays (plasma samples), possibly due to samples’ exposure to high temperatures, humidity and movement for 10 min during transport to the onsite laboratory.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It is unclear exactly why our error rate was higher than other studies which report this, but it is likely due to a combination of factors including: the conditions of the room (ie, humidity, frequent power outages), faulty module and relative inexperience preparing samples.</p>
                  <p>External monitoring of error logs was useful for identifying common errors and methods to reduce error risk, and developed laboratory technicians’ skills.

                  <p>Use of GeneXpert for POC HCV VL testing required regular device maintenance and quality control measures for assays. The local distributor provided maintenance, replacing six Xpert modules and installing extra equipment twice; hence, our extended warranty was highly cost-effective. Tuberculosis testing studies using GeneXpert in many LMICs have reported Xpert module replacement rates of 32% within 11 months<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and 42% in 19 months.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Our study replaced more modules than those cited above (to date, no HCV studies have reported this outcome); most were replaced at the MLF site, which suffered excessive dust and moisture.</p>

                  <p>The EQAS programme was difficult to establish because project staff were required to liaise with the study sponsor and Australia’s National Reference Laboratory (NRL) regarding enrolment processes, acquiring test samples and organising appropriate training, which was time-consuming. However once implemented, the programme ran smoothly. The cost of EQAS may be prohibitive for small programmes, unless integrated through national health laboratories in Myanmar. To date, no HCV implementation studies in LMICs report enrolment in EQAS programmes for community-based sites; it is unclear if this is due to non-reporting of operational components or non-implementation. Many implementation studies conducted globally are supported by Australia’s NRL, but are often short term and do not describe this aspect of implementation.</p>

                  <p>Recruitment targets reflecting realistic patient flow were useful to manage clinical staff workload. For one GP provider, with nurse and laboratory technician assisting, a recruitment rate of eight patients per day (in addition to follow-up appointments) was achievable. In other settings, campaign-style recruitment can process substantially more participants. For example, in Egypt, 3 physicians, 7 nurses and 4 laboratory specialists screened 3663 people for hepatitis C and hepatitis B over 4 days.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
                  <p>Note that staff at both sites were almost exclusively focused on providing HCV care to patients, whereas many GPs must balance various patient needs. GPs involved in delivering care in this study had treated HCV with DAAs in other research and philanthropic work. All clinical staff were committed to offering their patients a cure and to the study’s success, and had access to a broader implementation team to support model implementation and troubleshoot problems.</p>
                  <p>Workload could be reduced by eliminating monthly DAA dispensing and monitoring visits (ie, weeks 4, 8 and 12). This would also reduce patients’ transport costs and time off work, improving the model’s affordability and cost-effectiveness. Evidence suggests a minimal monitoring approach is safe, efficient and effective. The recent minimal monitoring (MINMON) approach trial tested having the entire 12-week course dispensed at the treatment initiation visit, no scheduled visits or laboratory monitoring, and only two points of remote contact scheduled to check adherence at week 4 and then to schedule SVR12 assessment appointment.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Throughout, patients were able to attend for unplanned visits whenever they required assistance. The SVR rates were excellent, at 95% (379/399) for all those initiated treatment. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Further work assessing the safety and effectiveness of this model for diverse patient groups may be required, for example, only 14% of the patient group reported current substance use; however, these results suggest no issues with cure rates using this minimal monitoring method.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p>

                  <p>The main operational challenges for GP-delivered care were developing clear referral criteria, an accessible referral pathway and GP-specialist communication. These challenges are not unique to this feasibility study; difficulties in deciding when to refer, navigating referral processes and achieving effective GP-specialist communication are common in many specialty areas.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Our criteria for hepatologist review were stricter than the national guidelines require. They were intended to provide guidance and reassurance to treating GPs regarding hepatic decompensation assessment, and reduce the risk of patients being treated with DAAs instead of being evaluated by specialists as per the national guidelines. Understanding when and how to involve specialists in GP-delivered care is critical to safe and effective delivery of HCV care in the community.</p>
                  <p>Myanmar’s healthcare system restricts development of accessible referral pathways for specialist care. Public hospital outpatient departments do not offer scheduled appointments, but require patients to register and wait until called. Other options include referral to a rotating specialist at a non-governmental organisation (NGO) clinic, as in our study, or referral to private specialist clinics, which we did not promote due to them being prohibitively expensive for most patients. In addition, remote consultations could occur using video conferencing technologies or secure, group instant messaging services to review patients’ specific treatment plan remotely or to review as case presentations on a regular basis for ongoing education. Uptake of remote consultations has been spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic necessitating fewer face-to-face consultations.</p>

Note that the staff involved here were invested in providing an accessible service to their patients and in the study’s success. The staff’s dedication to the service likely contributed to their acceptance of these challenges when providing a clinical service and their ability to adapt the service to overcome these challenges; the willingness of teams in other settings to overcome these challenges and adapt service delivery is unknown and should be considered when implementing in new contexts. Moreover, note that we covered the costs of all diagnostic tests, pretreatment assessments and treatment for patients (ie, patients paid nothing), which is unlikely to occur in a national government-funded primary care-based HCV programme.

                <title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title>
                <p>The model being partially embedded in the healthcare system was a strength, in that patients were referred to public hospitals if required, the service settings were similar to those of other primary healthcare clinics and it allowed identification of specific scalability challenges. Another strength was the use of various data sources for evaluation, and high-quality clinical and operational data supported the feasibility evaluation and recommendations. While we had good quality data, we were unable to definitively determine the root cause of the higher GeneXpert error rate; detailed reporting of GeneXpert error rates and module replacement rates should be prioritised from other community-based HCV programmes in LMICs.</p>
                <p>This model of care study’s external funding covered key implementation challenges, including refining laboratory set-up; lack of such support will threaten success in other settings. In addition, we evaluated the clinical model of care within a research setting, limiting its real-world applicability. Also, it should be noted that the staff at our clinics provided HCV testing and treatment as their primary work, as opposed to providing a broad suite of primary care services with HCV as one component. Also, for the purpose of this study, the clinics only treated those with HCV mono-infection; further modifications may be required to provide care to those with HIV or hepatitis B co-infection. The staff involved in providing clinical care were aware they were participating in a trial. This probably meant they invested more personal time and adjusted their standard of care to meet patients’ needs (within the protocol’s constraints); for example, being extra flexible with appointment times, calling patients to remind them of appointments, and occasional fundraising to cover the accommodation costs of patients from outside Yangon.</p>
                <p>Finally, the study coordinator conducted provider interviews and, with the study manager, wrote the evaluation, feasibility assessment and scalability recommendations. Their investment in the trial’s success potentially biased the questions asked when interviewing and the responses of staff regarding challenges in study implementation, as well as the interpretation of data.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Implementing a decentralised HCV care model in urban Myanmar is feasible, and was very successful in retaining people in care through to cure, with high cure rates over 90% achieved across both sites. However, implementation in these challenging circumstances required service adaptations and ongoing dedication of our resilient staff to provide a successful care model. Staff were well supported by a broader study team, and GPs had access to ongoing specialist mentoring and support. Our evaluation of the feasibility of the intervention, and experiences implementing the project lead us to 10 key recommendations, including importance for continuous error monitoring, extended warranties, infrastructure improvements to enable appropriate stock storage and laboratory conditions and options for further task-shifting. Requirements for implementation and feasibility considerations identified herein will assist in adapting this model to other settings, including general primary care facilities, decentralised national HIV programme sites and other NGO-led sites, in Myanmar and globally. Growing evidence for the effectiveness of decentralised, non-specialist-led HCV care supports expansion of this type of care model. Continued research is needed to generate more evidence on how to implement and adapt to context to improve HCV models of care.</p>
