                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent condition. People with knee OA often have other co-morbidities such as obesity. Exercise is advocated in all clinical guidelines for the management of knee OA. It is often undertaken as a home-based program, initially prescribed by a physiotherapist or other qualified health care provider. However, adherence to home-based exercise is often poor, limiting its ability to meaningfully change clinical symptoms of pain and/or physical function. While the efficacy of short message services (SMS) to promote adherence to a range of health behaviours has been demonstrated, its ability to promote home exercise adherence in people with knee OA has not been specifically evaluated. Hence, this trial is investigating whether the addition of an SMS intervention to support adherence to prescribed home-based exercise is more effective than no SMS on self-reported measures of exercise adherence.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">We are conducting a two-arm parallel-design, assessor-and participant-blinded randomised controlled trial (ADHERE) in people with knee OA and obesity. The trial is enrolling participants exiting from another randomised controlled trial, the TARGET trial, where participants are prescribed a 12-week home-based exercise program (either weight bearing functional exercise or non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening exercise) for their knee by a physiotherapist and seen five times over the 12 weeks for monitoring and supervision. Following completion of outcome measures for the TARGET trial, participants are immediately enrolled into the ADHERE trial. Participants are asked to continue their prescribed home exercise program unsupervised three times a week for 24-weeks and are randomly allocated to receive a behaviour change theory-informed SMS intervention to support home exercise adherence or to have no SMS intervention. Outcomes are measured at baseline and 24-weeks. Primary outcomes are self-reported adherence measures. Secondary outcomes include self-reported measures of knee pain, physical function, quality-of-life, physical activity, self-efficacy, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophising, participant-perceived global change and an additional adherence measure.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par9">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent and disabling condition that most commonly affects the knee joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many people with OA also have other chronic conditions including obesity, diabetes and heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. OA is ranked as the 11th highest contributor to disability globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For the individual, OA causes pain, loss of function, psychological distress and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For society, the economic costs, both direct and indirect, associated with OA are considerable, making OA a global public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. With the prevalence of OA predicted to increase with population ageing and rising obesity rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], research into effective, scalable and inexpensive interventions to support conservative OA management are a priority.</p>
              <p id="Par10">As there is currently no cure for knee OA, empowering patients to self-manage their condition is vital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The positive effects of exercise on pain and function in knee OA are widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and as such exercise is recommended as a core treatment in all clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Most commonly, exercise programs involve an initial period of supervision by a clinician, such as a physiotherapist, followed by unsupervised home-based exercise. Unfortunately, adherence to home-based exercise is often poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], particularly after clinician input ceases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and a wide variety of barriers may impact adherence such as pain, negative beliefs about exercise, life commitments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This decline in exercise adherence, after input from a clinician ceases, is typically mirrored by a decline in the pain and physical function gains achieved during a more intensive period of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Improving longer-term adherence to prescribed home-based exercise may be a key strategy to enhance and maintain the symptomatic benefits of exercise and ultimately improve long-term patient outcomes in this chronic condition.</p>
              <p id="Par11">To date, there is uncertainty about how best to help people with knee OA adhere to prescribed home-based exercise. Interventions showing promise include ‘booster’ or ‘refresher’ sessions with a physiotherapist and behavioural graded exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which involves gradual increases in physical activity plus ‘booster’ sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The benefits of clinician supervision on exercise adherence are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] with a key benefit being the clinician’s ability to closely monitor and influence patient behaviour, in particular to intervene if waning adherence is identified. Such ongoing clinician involvement, however, may not be feasible or practical due to access challenges and/or cost. Further research into interventions promoting exercise adherence is needed. Such interventions should be easily scalable and accessible and, as recommended by the Medical Research Council, be developed systematically using theoretical frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">The use of Short Messaging Services (SMS) to promote exercise adherence may be one solution. The effectiveness of SMS-based interventions to promote healthy behaviours relevant to OA such as physical activity, diet, and/or weight loss has been demonstrated in a range of settings and other conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] with promising evidence highlighting that the immediate benefits of SMS on behaviour can be sustained after SMS contact ceases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The use of SMS to improve adherence to home-based exercise has not yet been rigorously evaluated in people with knee OA. Only two small studies, a feasibility study and a pilot study, have investigated the use of mobile phone messaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found no effect on adherence or functional outcomes with the addition of 12 video messages (Multi Media Messaging Service, MMS) delivered over 6-weeks. The messages were designed to be visual prompts to exercises and were not informed by behaviour change theory nor targeted to the individual. The feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] assessed the effect of an educational booklet about OA and physical activity (delivered by mail), plus four weekly physical activity-promoting SMS, informed by Social Cognitive Theory. This study found significant positive effects on self-reported pain and exercise self-efficacy at 6 weeks. The intervention was well accepted by patients with 96% reporting they enjoyed receiving the messages and 88% finding them useful to promote physical activity. This feasibility study suggests that SMS has the potential to influence exercise outcomes (such as reduce pain and improve self-efficacy) in people with knee OA and is acceptable to patients. To investigate this further we developed a 24-week automated, semi-interactive SMS program to support adherence to prescribed home-based exercise for people with knee OA. The SMS program was developed rigorously applying behaviour change theory and is an inexpensive intervention, costing AUD $8 (approx.) per participant. The development of the SMS program is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">The primary aim of the ADHERE pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the effect of adding this 24-week SMS program to a prescribed home exercise program after cessation of clinician input. This trial will use a sample of participants exiting from another RCT, the TARGET trial, where participants are prescribed a home exercise program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Our primary hypothesis is that adherence to the prescribed, unsupervised home exercise program will be higher at 24-weeks in the group receiving the SMS intervention compared to the group receiving no SMS contact. Our secondary hypothesis is that improvements in other outcomes such as measures of pain, function, health-related quality-of-life, global change, and another measure of exercise adherence will be greater in the SMS group compared to the no contact control group.</p>

In the TARGET trial, participants visit a physiotherapist five times over 12 weeks to be prescribed either i) a weight bearing functional exercise program, or ii) a non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening exercise program to be completed four times per week as a home program. Each exercise program includes five lower limb exercises which use equipment (ankle weights, resistance exercise band, exercise step, foam matting) and/or body weight for exercise progressions. Participants are taught by the physiotherapist how to perform the exercises, how to modify their program to maintain the exercise challenge set by the physiotherapist and how to manage knee symptom aggravation as required. Participants receive paper-based instructions of each exercise from their physiotherapist and an optional exercise logbook to record their exercise practice. Participants are instructed by their physiotherapist, at the final physiotherapy session (week 10/12 of the TARGET trial) and by the study coordinator, at TARGET completion/ADHERE enrolment, to continue their prescribed home exercise program three times per week, for an additional 24-weeks.</p>

                <p id="Par19">On completion of the TARGET trial final assessment (ADHERE trial baseline), participants undergo 1:1 randomisation into one of two groups: i) no SMS; or ii) SMS intervention. Computer-generated randomisation has been prepared by our study biostatistician (JK) and is conducted by permuted blocks of sizes 6 to 12, stratified by exercise group (based on TARGET intervention received, either weight bearing functional exercise or non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening) and by baseline home exercise adherence in response to the question “In the past week, how many days did you do your home exercises?” with maximum number of days being 4; dichotomised into 0–1 = lower adherence and 2–4 to higher adherence).</p>
                <p id="Par20">To conceal allocation, the randomisation schedule is accessed via a password-protected computer program by a researcher not involved in participant recruitment or assessment. Participants are blinded to study groups, informed at TARGET trial enrolment, participation is for 9 months, with the initial 3 months (TARGET trial) comparing the effects of two different exercise programs and the following 6 months (ADHERE trial) investigating strategies aimed at helping them stick to a prescribed exercise program, which may include a log book and encouraging text messages. To avoid influencing exercise adherence behaviour participants are not informed of the two separate studies, of re-randomisation into this trial or exact intervention details. The statistician is blinded to group allocation, which will be revealed upon completion of the statistical analyses.</p>

                  <p id="Par21">Participants in the control group are asked to continue the home-based exercise program prescribed to them in the TARGET trial, three times weekly for 24 weeks. Participants are not restricted from taking medication or pursuing other knee interventions during the 24-weeks. This information will be collected at the 24-week timepoint, via online survey.</p>

                  <title>SMS intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par22">In addition to continuing the home-based exercise program prescribed in the TARGET trial, participants in this group receive a SMS intervention to support adherence. The SMS intervention is a 24-week automated SMS program delivered via mobile phone designed to support adherence to prescribed home-based exercise.</p>
                  <p id="Par23">The development of the SMS intervention is reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Briefly, this intervention was designed applying the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework which is a synthesis of 19 models of behaviour providing a transparent and systematic framework for the development of behaviour change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The BCW uses the COM-B model to describe the influences of behaviour using three interacting categories; i) capability (e.g. skills and knowledge), ii) opportunity (e.g. resources and social cues) and iii) motivation (e.g. intentions and desires). To provide greater detail the COM-B categories can be further divided into the 14 domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The intervention content was informed by our previous research which identified key barriers and facilitators to exercise adherence in knee/hip OA mapped to the TDF and the COM-B model of the BCW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) which linked to the COM-B/TDF domains and each barrier/facilitator, were then selected from the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy (BCTTv1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] as recommended in the BCW. The selected BCTs were then used to construct the SMS interventions messages.</p>
                  <p id="Par24">For the SMS intervention, participants receive up to five text messages weekly. Message frequency reduces over the 24-week intervention, as recommended in the literature, to lessen participant burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Message length ranges from 105 to 420 characters. Each week (weeks 1–8) to each fortnight (weeks 9–24) participants receive a message asking them to self-report the number of home exercise sessions completed in the previous week. Participants who report low adherence (≤2 exercise session/week) then receive a message prompting them to select a barrier from a predetermined list (forgot, too tired, knee hurts so can’t exercise, worried exercise is causing pain, exercise isn’t helping, boring, lack of time, life stress, and none above apply to me) which best explains why they were unable to complete their exercises as prescribed (three times in the previous week). Participant barrier selection then triggers a BCT message providing a suggestion tailored to help address the selected barrier. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> lists the BCTs used to address each barrier. Program automation is designed to prevent the same message being sent if the same barrier is selected more than once. Participants who report being adherent (≥3 exercise session/week) receive a positive reinforcement message encouraging continued completion of the home exercises three times each week with program automation ensuring a different message is received each time. Participants also receive regular motivational SMS (twice weekly initially and reducing to once fortnightly by 24-weeks) containing BCT suggestions linked to exercise facilitators. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> lists the exercise facilitators targeted in the intervention and the BCTs which were converted into SMS to address them. Furthermore, to enhance engagement, participants receive special occasion messages (e.g. birthday, Christmas).</p>
                  <p id="Par25">After randomisation, each participant is guided by a researcher through a three-message practice sequence to assist in replying to messages and are informed that they can opt out of the SMS intervention at any time by sending the word “stop” to the SMS program number. This practice session is in person at the University of Melbourne or remotely via email if the participant is unable to attend baseline assessment at the university. Participants are not restricted from taking medication or pursuing other knee interventions during the 24-weeks.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par48">This RCT is investigating if a behaviour change theory-informed SMS intervention that addresses key barriers and facilitators to exercise adherence in people with knee OA, delivered once clinician involvement ceases, can improve adherence to a prescribed home-based exercise program over 24-weeks when compared to a no contact control. This study will provide insight into the effectiveness of SMS technology to promote adherence in the knee OA population and if effective will be an easily scalable, cheap and accessible intervention for people with knee OA including those in regional and remote areas.</p>
