                  <p id="Par1"><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> forms dormant liver stages that can reactivate weeks or months following an acute infection. Recurrent infections are often associated with a febrile illness and can cause a cumulative risk of severe anaemia, direct and indirect mortality, and onward transmission of the parasite. There is an increased risk of <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasitaemia following falciparum malaria suggesting a rationale for universal use of radically curative treatment in patients with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria even in the absence of detectable <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasitaemia in areas that are co-endemic for both species.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a multicentre, health care facility-based, randomized, controlled, open-label trial in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Ethiopia. Patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, G6PD activity of â‰¥70% of the adjusted male median (AMM) and haemoglobin levels â‰¥8g/dl are recruited into the study and randomized to either receive standard schizonticidal treatment plus 7-day high dose primaquine (total dose 7mg/kg) or standard care in a 1:1 ratio. Patients are followed up weekly until day 63. The primary endpoint is the incidence risk of any <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasitemia on day 63. Secondary endpoints include incidence risk on day 63 of symptomatic <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria and the risk of any <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasitaemia. Secondary safety outcomes include the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events, the incidence risk of severe anaemia (Hb&lt;5g/dl and &lt;7g/dl) and/or the risk for blood transfusion, the incidence risk of â‰¥ 25% fall in haemoglobin with and without haemoglobinuria, and the incidence risk of â‰¥ 25% fall in haemoglobin to under 7g/dl with and without haemoglobinuria.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study evaluates the potential benefit of a universal radical cure for both <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in different endemic locations. If found safe and effective universal radical cure could represent a cost-effective approach to clear otherwise unrecognised <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections and hence accelerate <italic>P. vivax</italic> elimination.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par19"><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> forms dormant liver stages that can reactivate weeks or months following an acute infection. Recurrent infections are associated with a febrile illness, a cumulative risk of severe anaemia, direct and indirect mortality, and are an important source of onward transmission of the parasite. In co-endemic areas, up to 50% of patients re-present with <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasitaemia following treatment of acute <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This is far greater than would be expected from reinfection alone. An association between the speed of initial parasite clearance and subsequent recurrent <italic>P. vivax</italic> suggests that relapses may be triggered by the febrile illness of acute malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hence, in co-endemic regions, there is a good rationale for opportunistically eradicating <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites from the liver in patients presenting with uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par20">The only hypnozoiticidal drug that is widely available is primaquine (PQ), an 8-aminoquinoline (8-AQ), which can cause severe drug-induced haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The risk of haemolysis after PQ depends on the dose administered and the G6PD activity of the individual exposed. The risk of serious haemolysis associated with G6PD deficiency makes clinicians reluctant to prescribe PQ without prior testing, which is often unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When PQ is prescribed, patient adherence to the standard 14-day regimen is poor, resulting in a high risk of relapse. In some locations, the effectiveness of 14 days of unsupervised PQ is extremely poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par21">The recently completed multicentre IMPROV study compared the efficacy of a 7-day PQ regimen (1.0 mg/kg/day for 7 days) with a 14-day regimen (0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days). PQ was given with either chloroquine (CQ) (in Ethiopia, Vietnam and Afghanistan) or Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PIP) (in Indonesia). In total, 2388 patients were enrolled and screened for G6PD deficiency using the fluorescent spot test (FST). The 7-day PQ regimenÂ (PQ7) was non-inferior to the 14-day regimen and 5-fold more efficacious at reducing <italic>P. vivax</italic> recurrence than the control (CQ or DHA-PIP alone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Whilst there were slightly more minor adverse events in the PQ7 arm, the regimen was generally well tolerated with no patients requiring blood transfusion. Adherence to and thus effectiveness of the shorter course of PQ is likely to be significantly better than that of the 14-day regimen.</p>
                <p id="Par22">There is a need for safe and effective radical cure of malaria in areas co-endemic for both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>, and the benefits of this treatment are likely to extend to patients presenting with uncomplicated malaria due to either species. The potential to provide a radical cure safely with a 7-day regimen of PQ provides major practical advantages. Our multicentre randomized, open-label trial compares the safety and efficacy of a high dose PQ treatment in G6PD normal patients with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to reduce the risk of subsequent <italic>P. vivax</italic> episodes to the current standard practice of providing only schizonticidal treatment.</p>

                <p id="Par52">All participants in the intervention arm will be treated for acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria according to local guidelines and as outlined for the control group. In addition, patients in the intervention arm will be administered a high-dose PQ regimen over 7 days (1.0 mg/kg/day for 7 days), which will be commenced on day 0 and administered along with a small snack. All treatment will be directly supervised.</p>

If the participant withdraws consent or is lost to follow-up for 4 or more weekly visits, the patient will be excluded/withdrawn. It will be left to the Investigatorâ€™s clinical judgement whether or not an adverse event (AE) is of sufficient severity to require stopping the participantâ€™s treatment. If the participant is withdrawn due to an AE, the investigator will arrange for follow-up visits or telephone calls until the AE has resolved and conditions stabilized.</p>

Any additional drugs taken during the trial period for whatever reason will be documented (e.g. antibiotics for inter-current infection, anti-emetics, anti-pyretics). Patients who discontinue their trial medication prematurely, or who fail to respond to trial medication and receive other anti-malarial therapy, will be recorded with a start and end date. Drugs with antimalarial activity should be avoided, unless prescribed by the attending clinician.</p>

The DSMB is responsible for safeguarding the interests of study participants, assessing predominantly the safety of study procedures, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the study. The DSMB members are independent and it is their responsibility to prevent patients being exposed to any excess risks by recommending trial suspension or termination early if the safety or efficacy results are sufficiently convincing. The responsibilities of the DSMB are (i) to determine how frequently interim reviews of trial data should be undertaken, (ii) to conduct interim safety data reviews, and (iii) to report (following each DSMB meeting) to the sponsor and to recommend whether the trial should continue, the protocol be modified or the trial be stopped.</p>

It will be left to the Investigatorâ€™s clinical judgement whether or not an AE is of sufficient severity to require stopping the participantâ€™s treatment. A participant may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE.
