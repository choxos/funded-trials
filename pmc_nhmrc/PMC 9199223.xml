                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Financial distress is thought to be a key reason why small-medium enterprise (SME) owners experience higher levels of mental health conditions compared with the broader population. Business advisors who form trusting, high-quality relationships with their SME clients, are therefore well placed to: (1) help prevent/reduce key sources of financial distress, (2) better understand the business and personal needs of their clients and, (3) recognise the signs and symptoms of mental health conditions and encourage help-seeking where appropriate. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of relationship building training (RBT) combined with mental health first aid (MHFA) training for business advisors with MHFA alone, on the financial and mental health of their SME-owner clients.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a single blind, two-arm randomised controlled trial. Participants will be business advisors who provide information, guidance and/or assistance to SME owner clients and are in contact with them at least 3 times a year. The business advisors will invite their SME-owner clients to complete 3 online surveys at baseline, 6- and 12-months. Business advisors will be randomised to one of two conditions, using a 1:1 allocation ratio: (1) MHFA with RBT; or (2) MHFA alone, and complete 3 online surveys at baseline, 2- and 6-months. Primary outcomes will be measured in the business advisors and consist of the quality of the relationship, stigmatizing attitude, confidence to offer mental health first aid, quality of life and provision of mental health first aid. Secondary outcomes will be measured in the SME owners and includes trust in their business advisors, the quality of this relationship, financial wellbeing, financial distress, psychological distress, help-seeking behaviour, and quality of life. To complement the quantitative data, we will include a qualitative process evaluation to examine what contextual factors impacted the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the training.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) account for 99% of all businesses in Australia and at least 95% of enterprises in all OECD countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. They contribute significantly to Australia’s social and economic prosperity, with small businesses employing approximately 4.7 million people and accounting for 41% of total employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite their importance, SME owners face significant ongoing challenges. Externally, these challenges include increasing market volatility, lending restrictions, extensive legislative reform, and rapid technological advancements, while internally they include monitoring cash flow, managing staff, and ensuring the smooth administration of the business [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These challenges can generate significant financial pressure and in turn, financial distress (or a lack of financial wellbeing) among SME owners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Financial distress, the SME owner's working conditions (e.g., long hours, burden of responsibility, isolation, obligation to work when sick) and their low rates of help seeking are thought to be why this group experiences higher levels of mental health conditions compared with the broader population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">11</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered a sharp increase in psychological distress among small business owners, as a recent study commissioned by the Australian Government shows 1 in 3 rated their mental health as fair to poor during the first three months of the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Developing strategies that can help alleviate the financial distress experienced by SME owners, but at the same time encourage owners to seek help for potential mental health conditions, are therefore critical for protecting and promoting their mental health.</p>
              <p id="Par14">One group that has the potential to address financial distress and act as an intermediary between SME owners and mental health services are business advisors, particularly accountants and bookkeepers. SME owners draw on the technical expertise provided by business advisors on a regular basis, and advisors can often form trusting, long-term relationships with their clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Intuitively, the formation of these more trusting, longer-term relationships provides the potential for business advisors to better understand the business and personal challenges faced by SME owners, to identify the early signs of mental health conditions and to take action to help alleviate the sources of financial distress.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Mental health literacy programs, such as Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training, are a key strategy for the early identification of mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety) and are designed to reduce their impact (i.e., secondary, and tertiary prevention) rather than preventing them from occurring in the first instance (i.e., primary prevention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A systematic review has shown that MHFA training can improve knowledge of mental health and the treatments available, recognition of mental health conditions and reduce stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This training is popular in the health and human service sectors, and one observational study on financial counsellors has been conducted, however it is not known to what extent their clients received mental health first aid-related advice and support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">The aim of the current study called Counting on U is to evaluate the effectiveness of relationship building training (RBT) combined with mental health first aid (MHFA) for business advisors, compared with MHFA alone, on the relationship between business advisors and their SME-owner clients, and the financial and mental health wellbeing of their clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The RBT has been guided by primary prevention principles and aims to equip business advisors with the skills to: (1) form more trusting relationships with their clients so that SME owners feel more comfortable disclosing financial difficulties and/or mental health conditions, (2) better understand the needs of the business and the business owner and thus, (3) prevent/reduce the financial distress experienced by SME owners.</p>
              <p id="Par17">In view of the above, we have formulated a set of hypotheses for testing in the current study. We expect that for business advisors randomised to the RBT and MHFA training compared with MHFA alone: (1) will be in a better position to recognise signs of distress in their SME-owner clients, so the quality of their relationship will be stronger, (2) better understand how financial distress may lead to poor mental health, and decrease any stigmatizing attitudes they may have (e.g., depression is a sign of personal weakness) and, (3) be more confident to provide mental health first aid and the frequency in which they do so, will be greater. SME owners whose advisors undertake the RBT and MHFA, compared with MHFA alone will report: (1) greater trust in their business advisor, (2) the quality of the relationship with their business advisor will be stronger, (3) improved financial wellbeing, psychological distress, and quality of life, and (4) greater help seeking intentions and behaviour. This will be an Australian and New Zealand wide study targeting eligible participants across all regions, urban/regional/rural and states, to ensure SME owner clients such as farmers in drought-stricken areas, to city coffee shop owners, have an opportunity to benefit from the program.</p>

                  <p id="Par19">The recruitment of business advisors into the online training program, Counting on U, will be conducted over 18 months via membership of their respective professional organisation (i.e., Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), Certified Practicing Accountants (CPA) Australia, Institute of Public Accountants (IPA), Institute of Certified Bookkeepers (ICB)). Representatives from each organisation will invite their members via email to participate in the training and research program. The project will also be advertised through Deakin University and professional organisations’ newsletters, websites, and social media pages.</p>
                  <p id="Par20">Convenience sampling will be used, with all respondents who meet the inclusion criteria offered places in the training program until a total of 984 participants have been recruited. The research team will monitor the participants’ location in urban/regional/rural areas and state, and if a selection bias has occurred, advertising will be targeted to these underrepresented groups. All business advisors will be requested to complete a short online survey at three time-points: baseline, 2 months, and 6 months post-training (equivalent to 1- and 5-months follow-up post-training) (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Counting on U schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2022_4034_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram showing the enrolment, allocation, quantitative and qualitative data collection time points for the business advisors and their SME-owner clients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2022_4034_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par22">The business advisor sample will be selected according to the following inclusion criteria: any qualified business advisor from Australia or New Zealand who provides business-related advice to a small-medium enterprise (SME) client. Business advice refers to the information, guidance and/or assistance provided by an external advisor that either directly or indirectly helps to prevent/reduce the financial pressures experienced by SME owner-clients. The SME owner client must be the owner-manager of the business (i.e., non-operational owners or ‘silent partners’ are not included) and the business needs to employ 1–199 employees. The business advisor must be in contact with their client at least three times a year. The exclusion criteria will be any business advisor who has completed Mental Health First Aid training within the last two years.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Because of our recruitment strategy, eligible participants will be randomised to one of two arms prior to receiving a generic invitation to join the study. They will be informed what study arm they are in, after they have agreed to participate. Thus, participants will only be blind to group allocation prior to providing consent to avoid self-selection bias. Participants must read a plain language statement and sign an online consent form hosted by Deakin University prior to starting (Supplementary file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Participants can withdraw at any time by contacting the research team at Deakin University.</p>

                  <p id="Par24">Business advisors randomised to the intervention arm will attend Relationship Building Training (RBT) over a 2-hour live zoom session. The module, which will be delivered by qualified instructors, aims to equip business advisors with the skills they need to enhance trustworthiness, reduce information asymmetry and how to harness their communication skills when having a difficult conversation about finances or mental health with their clients. The RBT module’s content was developed by the principal investigators (AN, GT) and is partially drawn from a post-graduate client relationship building unit taught to accountants and financial planners at Deakin University. This module will be followed by a global, certified, blended Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The training requires 5 hours of online course work followed by 2 × 2.5-hour live zoom sessions delivered by qualified instructors. MHFA aims to enhance mental health literacy, teach business advisors the skills to identify the signs of mental health conditions, and how to have a conversation with SME owner clients who may need professional help. Participants will also attend 2 × 1-hour Booster sessions 1 and 3-months after completing the training. These booster sessions aim to give participants the opportunity to consolidate their learning, to identify factors that help or hinder the transfer of learning into a change in behaviour and to share experiences on how to maximise their learning. The importance of the business advisors using self-care to protect their own well-being will be reinforced in the RBT and Booster sessions.</p>

                  <p id="Par27">At each of the data collection points, the quality of the relationship between the business advisor and their SME owner clients will be measured using a Quality of the Relationship Questionnaire. The questions will measure the business advisor’s belief about how much attention they are giving their clients, their awareness about their client’s financial and emotional needs, the quality of the advice they provide and the impact they have on their business. Ten items will be used, four are from the Relationship Flourishing Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] that has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.93, and six are from a validated newly developed tool by the principal investigators (AN, GT) with factor loadings ranging from 0.81 to 0.87. The Relationship Flourishing Scale has demonstrated acceptable concurrent, convergent and content validities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. All items are on a 7-point Likert scale (1 strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree) with a higher total score indicating a higher quality relationship.</p>

                  <p id="Par28">The business advisors personal stigmatising attitude will be measured at each time point using eight statements that queries the respondent’s opinion of a person described in a modified vignette (personal stigma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The statements are based on those developed by Griffiths et al., who also reported on their psychometric properties, showing moderately high convergent validity and acceptable Cronbach alphas of 0.78 to 0.82 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The vignette portrays a 35-year-old business owner who is showing signs of depression. An example of a personal stigma item is: “A problem like John’s is a sign of personal weakness”. All 8 items will be scored on 5-point Likert scale (1 strongly agree, 5 strongly disagree), with a higher score indicating stronger stigmatising attitudes.</p>
                  <p id="Par29">Previous work has shown that the 8 items are multi-dimensional and by grouping certain items  they can provide two distinct stigma dimensions “weak-not-sick” and “dangerous/unpredictable” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. “Weak-not-sick” suggests the problem portrayed in the vignette is a personal weakness under the control of the person rather than as a medical condition. While “dangerous/unpredictable” characterizes the vignette character as unpredictable and dangerous. These two dimensions can inform whether participants better understand mental health is not a sickness but are still fearful of their behaviour. A factor loading analysis will be conducted to assess which items best load onto each dimension and a total mean and standard deviation score will be generated for each.</p>

A score of 1 will be given if they answer A Few or Many Times, with higher scores indicating they delivered mental health first aid more often. If they have talked with a SME owner client, they will be asked to indicate how many out of 12 actions they had taken. A score of 1 will be allocated to any action they have answered A Few or Many Times and summing these scores.

This tool assesses three elements of trust: confidence, acting proactively and not exploiting vulnerabilities. In addition, the SME owner’s confidence in the services (i.e., beyond compliance services) offered by the business advisor will be assessed. Eleven questions will be used to assess these elements on a 5-point Likert scale (1 strongly disagree, 5 strongly agree) with a higher total score indicating a more trusting relationship. Factor loadings for these items range from 0.43 to 0.95 and show good reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.931 to 0.937. The items have demonstrated content validity, i.e., they assess all relevant components of trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

The questions will measure the SME owner’s satisfaction on how aware their business advisor is about their wellbeing, whether they can turn to their advisor when things are going badly, and whether they seek their advice on a range of business matters. Six items will be used from a newly developed tool by the principal investigators (AN, GT) with factor loadings of 0.81 to 0.87, and uniqueness scores of 24 to 34%, indicating they are highly relevant to measuring the quality of relationship.

The SME owners must consider how much they agree with 5 statements such as “I am behind with my finances”. Their answers will be scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1 strongly agree, 5 strongly disagree) and a lower total mean score will indicate a more positive outlook. Perceived financial well-being is a strong predictor of overall well-being and the items have a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86 to 0.94 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Should differential attrition arise part-way through the project, i.e., due to a preference to partake in the intervention, the allocation ratio will be adjusted to compensate for this, i.e., a 1:2 ratio (MHFA+RBT: MHFA). The membership engagement officer at each business advisor’s member organisation (i.e., CAANZ, CPA, IPA, ICB) will conduct the randomisation process by providing eligible participants with a computer-generated unique numeric ID and allocating them to RBT + MHFA or MHFA alone. The participant’s names will be concealed throughout this process. Allocation concealment will be achieved because the member organisations will be unable to predict the unique ID allocated to each participant before they are sorted and randomised to a group. Participants will use their unique ID for completing the surveys, and the researchers will not have access to the business advisor’s contact details only unique ID, group allocation and survey results.

                <title>Statistics</title>
                <p id="Par49">A report of the findings will follow CONSORT guidelines. The quantitative analysis will examine whether the magnitude of change in primary and secondary outcomes is different between the SME owners and their business advisors randomly allocated to the MFHA or RBT + MHFA arm (i.e., between-group differential change). Population average models, using a generalised estimated equation (GEE) approach accounting for within-individual repeated measures, will be used to assess for a treatment effect in the primary outcome. The analysis will employ an unstructured correlation structure for the GEE analysis and include a robust covariance matrix estimator, or Sandwich estimator, to provide a consistent estimate of the treatment effect. The GEE approach models the average response of the population rather than modelling the within-subject covariance structure, and unlike a basic regression model, it does not require distributional assumptions. It considers the correlation of within-subject data (longitudinal data) by using all available data for each subject, and it can be used on data with non-normal distributions. The GEE model will contain the fixed effect of intervention allocation and nominal time points as the main effects, and a two-way interaction between intervention allocation and time. The two-way interaction will estimate the effect of differential change from baseline measure in the intervention compared with control group at 2- and 6-months measurements. The GEE model will compare the between-group mean change for business advisors from baseline to 2-months (1-month post-training), baseline to 6-months (4 months post-training), 2-months to 6-months to test the hypothesis (i.e., the two-way interaction between intervention allocation and measurement at 2-months and it’s 95% confidence interval). For SME owners, the between-group differential change will be assessed from baseline to 6-months, baseline to 12-months, and 6-months to 12-months.</p>
                <p id="Par50">In unblinded randomised control trials, participants allocated to the control group who are aware of a more desirable treatment group, may be envious of participants in the treatment group and be less willing to complete surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Because of the appeal the new RBT may offer to business advisors, we anticipate that participants in our MHFA alone group may be unmotivated to attend training sessions, complete surveys and ultimately dropout. If such a trend is observed in this study, we may take a pragmatic decision to change the random allocation ratio to allocate more participants to MHFA alone to have equal number of participants in both groups to enhance statistical power. If such a change in the allocation ratio is needed (e.g., from 1:1 to 1:2 to account for differential attrition), the participants will no longer have an equal chance of receiving each of the treatments. Bias could also arise if participants differ in important characteristics, hence the data from these two parts of the trial will be tested for homogeneity. If any significant differences are identified, the results will be analysed separately and then combined, as in a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par53">The aim of this paper is to describe how we will: 1) deliver and evaluate an RCT designed to assess the effectiveness of combining RBT with MHFA for business advisors and their SME owner clients, and 2) conduct a process evaluation to assess what contextual factors impacted the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the program. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to test the effectiveness of using business advisors as a conduit for providing SME owners with mental health support. We believe this approach will ensure SME owners who need help are more likely to receive it.</p>
              <p id="Par54">One of the key strengths of the current research is that the RCT has been developed by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers (spanning the accounting and management sciences, public health and clinical psychiatry), working in conjunction with accounting and bookkeeping member bodies (IPA, CPA, CAANZ, ICB), influential policy makers (Beyond Blue, WorkSafe Victoria, The Treasury) and Australia’s largest provider of MHFA training services (MHFA Australia). The strong partnerships with the professional member bodies are particularly important for ensuring that the trial could be delivered on a sector-wide scale and as part of the CPD training that accountants and bookkeepers are expected to undertake as part of their professional accreditation requirements. The accreditation points gained from the training will help incentivise business advisors to take part and to increase the likelihood that the required number of participants are recruited. In addition, collaborating with member bodies and policy makers will help the authors identify future knowledge translation and sustainability opportunities to address mental wellbeing in the business sector.</p>
              <p id="Par55">The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the likelihood that SME owners will contact their accountant and bookkeeper in heightened states of distress. While this increased demand reinforces the need to equip business advisors with the skills to work with clients experiencing high levels of stress, the anticipated surges in business advisor workloads also represent a key barrier to advisers undertaking the training. To address this, the program has been designed with the business advisors’ operational needs in mind (e.g., fully online, range of training dates offered, incentivised participation). The process evaluation and ongoing dialogue with the professional organisational bodies will also identify any recruitment and retention problems early and to implement appropriate mitigation strategies as soon as possible.</p>
              <p id="Par56">Another strength of this study is using a rigorous RCT design to assess the benefit of offering RBT in combination with MHFA compared with MHFA alone. This design will minimise confounding factors, such as lockdowns during the pandemic, that could have a significant impact on the outcomes. The length of follow-up in business advisors (5-months post training) and SME owners (11-months post training) will also inform whether there are any long-term benefits. Another unique component of this RCT is the recruitment of SME owner clients, who as end-users or beneficiaries of the training, will provide insight into the effectiveness of the training. However, the recruitment of SME owners is expected to be difficult largely because of the busy, all-consuming nature of their role (e.g., long work hours, burden of responsibility). It is for this reason, we introduced gift voucher incentives for SME owners to complete the surveys and to participate in interviews. Another strength of the study is its large sample size predicated on conservative effect size estimates.</p>
              <p id="Par57">To date, the business environment has not been leveraged as a platform for delivering mental health interventions, notwithstanding the major impact of mental health conditions on the sector. The findings from this research will provide important information on the benefits of incorporating a mental health literacy program like MHFA within a more mainstream client relationship building program. If the current research supports the hypothesis that the combined approach leads to more beneficial outcomes than MHFA alone, then the approach could be adopted by other small business intermediaries (e.g., human resource consultants, lawyers, bankers). Similarly, these findings could also be used to inform how business accounting and finance students are trained prior to entering the workforce (i.e., via undergraduate and post-graduate degrees). Finally, the process evaluation will be critical for developing a more detailed understanding of the range of factors that helped or hindered program effectiveness and the success of its roll-out. This information, along with the outcomes of the RCT, can be used to guide efforts to enhance program reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance in the business sector.</p>
