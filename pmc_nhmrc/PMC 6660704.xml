                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a significant health issue affecting Aboriginal Australians. Long-term hearing loss can cause communication problems, educational disadvantage, and social isolation. Current standard treatment for CSOM in our region is twice daily dry mopping of the pus from the ear canal followed by instillation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic ear drops for up to 16 weeks, or until the discharge resolves for a period of 3 days. The treatment is long, laborious and fails to resolve ear discharge in 70% of cases in remote communities. Bacterial pathogens also persist. Povidone-iodine ear wash is the preferred method of clearing ear discharge in Western Australia. However, evidence of its effectiveness is lacking. In systematic reviews, topical antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) have been shown to be more effective than oral antibiotics or topical antiseptics. Currently, it is unclear whether there are any benefits of combining these treatments.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This protocol describes a 2 × 2 factorial randomised controlled trial of two different interventions (povidone-iodine ear wash and oral cotrimoxazole), given as adjunctive therapy to standard treatment for CSOM. 280 children, between 2 months and 17 years of age, Indigenous or non-Indigenous, living in participating Northern Territory (NT) communities are randomised to standard treatment (dry mopping and ciprofloxacin drops) plus one of two topical treatments (dilute povidone-iodine ear wash or no wash) and one of two oral medication treatments (16 weeks of cotrimoxazole or placebo).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par21">In 2013, remote Indigenous communities participating in ear and nasopharyngeal carriage surveillance found that around 50% of young children (mean age 13 months) had otitis media with effusion (OME), 37% had acute otitis media (AOM without perforation), and 12% had chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] CSOM is one of the most significant health problems affecting young Aboriginal children in Australia today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] having compounding effects on hearing, behaviour and learning. It was not that long ago that children with pus draining from their ears were a common sight in remote communities with more than 50% of young children in some remote communities having long term CSOM. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] Although the rates of CSOM have decreased, the NT hearing service reported that 53% of young Aboriginal children living in remote NT communities still have some form of hearing loss. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Of all forms of ear disease, children diagnosed with CSOM had the highest levels of hearing loss. It should be noted that children with dry perforations and wet perforations (or CSOM) may be interchangeable, depending on the season and the child’s upper respiratory infection status. Combined rates of wet and dry perforation between 2007 and 2011 were 26% (15 and 11%) in 0–5 year olds, 26% (10 and 16%) in 6–11 year olds, and 37% (12 and 25%) in 12+ year olds respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While effective timely treatment of acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) aims to prevent CSOM, the challenges involved in delivering appropriate treatment in remote settings mean that a large group of children develop chronic severe ear disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The early age of onset, the severity of the hearing loss, and the persistence of this infection, means that improving medical management for this condition is a priority. Once CSOM has become established, it is extremely difficult to treat. Ear discharge failed to resolve at the end of topical antibiotic therapy in 70% Indigenous children in our previous randomised trial. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] While topical antibiotics have been shown to be more effective than oral antibiotics and topical antiseptics, it is unclear whether there are any benefits of combining these treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other treatment options, such as prolonged antibiotic intravenous treatment in hospital have not been used (or accepted) in the management of children from remote Aboriginal communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Topical quinolone antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) are currently the recommended first line treatment for CSOM and are theoretically more active against the bacteria commonly associated with CSOM (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>), but have failed to eradicate all pathogens involved (particularly <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>). Our previous randomised trial comparing topical treatments, ciprofloxacin versus framycetin (0.5%), gramicidin, dexamethasone (sofradex®) for CSOM found that <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species were the most commonly isolated pathogens in ear discharge after treatment (present in 75% of specimens). We also documented an as overgrowth of fungal species. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] There are no large studies describing the microbiology of CSOM in Aboriginal children. There is also lack of evidence for the effectiveness of combining antiseptic ear washes (povidone-iodine) with topical antibiotics (ciprofloxacin or sofradex®). The only randomised controlled trial (RCT) in Aboriginal children to describe a treatment that was effective in the majority of children with CSOM (around 75%) used the combination of povidone-iodine ear washes followed by ciprofloxacin ear drops. However, there were important differences in the severity of disease in these children compared to those currently living in remote communities of the NT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Based on the clinical trials literature, treatment with oral antibiotics is not recommended routinely for CSOM and are usually less effective than topical antibiotic treatment. In our most recent CSOM study, 75% of children who sought clinical care from their regular health care provider were prescribed amoxycillin. It is unclear whether this oral treatment is ever indicated. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] The only published placebo-controlled trial found the addition of oral cotrimoxazole to topical aminoglycoside plus steroid treatment reduced persistent discharge by 25 and 15% after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Currently, there is a preference for surgical repair of the tympanic membrane in older children with chronic perforations that are dry at time of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This RCT will determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of oral antibiotics and povidone-iodine ear washes in addition to current recommended treatment (dry mopping plus topical antibiotic drops). Outcomes after four months, and at 12 months follow-up will include degree of resolution of ear discharge, bacterial pathogen persistence, healing of the tympanic membrane and hearing levels.</p>

                <p id="Par24">This study was approved and reviewed six monthly by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Northern Territory Department of Health and the Menzies School of Health Research (HREC-2014- 2170), and the Central Australian Human Research Ethics Committee (CAHREC-14-228). The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Declaration of Helsinki and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) recommendations for research in Indigenous communities. Each participating community council/board provided written approval of the study to the ethics committees. Freely given informed written consent was obtained in person, by the research nurses from every subject’s parent/guardian (plus assent from children over 10 years of age) prior to enrolment. The study information, provided face-to-face in written, oral, and pictorial formats have been approved by the Ethics Committees. An interpreter was used when requested (or deemed necessary by the researchers). Sufficient time was provided to ask questions, discuss participation with relevant others, and obtain further study details prior to signing and dating consent forms. Consent included permission for their child to have an ear examination, nasal and ear swabs, a general child health check at baseline, 4 and 12 months follow-up visits. Details of data collection at each of the scheduled assessment times are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Signed consent was also sought to access their child’s medical records, complete a lifestyle interview regarding information on likely risk or protective factors for otitis media, to use the study and standard medicines, and to be contacted by study researchers at the participant’s home and via phone or social media, for the duration of the clinical trial.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Schedule of assessments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Visit #</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr><tr><th>Event</th><th><sup>a</sup>Screening</th><th>Day1</th><th>16weeks</th><th>12months</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Informed consent</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Check informed consent</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Randomisation<sup>b</sup></td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Ear exam</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Check inclusion/exclusion criteria</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Nose and ear swabs</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Lifestyle questionnaire</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Clinical note review</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Check recent audiology</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>General health check</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Record antibiotic/study medication use</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>SAE reporting<sup>c</sup></td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Screening is an ear exam to assess ear status and can occur on Day 1</p><p><sup>b</sup> Randomisation may be conducted at the time of screening</p><p><sup>c</sup>Severe adverse events reporting will occur throughout the study</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par25">Eligible children whose parent or guardian provided signed informed consent were randomised to one of the four treatment options according to a computer-generated sequence. This was obtained by a phone call (interactive voice response system) to the NHMRC Clinical Trial Centre (CTC). Children were stratified according to community and age (&lt;4y, 4-10y, &gt;10y) using a minimisation procedure<bold>.</bold> The allocation sequence was concealed from all investigators throughout the study. Study staff were blinded to the oral component of the treatment at randomisation and follow-up assessments. However, it was not possible to blind the topical treatment groups. All laboratory staff are blinded. The randomisation of an individual participant would only be unblinded in emergency situations where the chief investigator and study’s medical monitor feels the emergency cannot be adequately addressed without knowing which treatment was delivered.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par26">Intervention 1: The active oral medication used for this trial is cotrimoxazole suspension (or tablet for children over 12 years of age). A non-active formulation of the exact colour, taste and appearance as the intervention was used as the placebo. Cotrimoxazole suspension was given as 4 mg/kg per dose (of trimethoprim component) twice a day orally for 16 weeks. The placebo was administered in an identical manner.</p>
                <p id="Par27">Intervention 2: The topical treatment was aqueous povidone-iodine 10%, diluted in clean, room temperature water (1:20). Each discharging ear was syringed twice daily using a 20 ml syringe for up to 16 weeks or until the ear was dry for 14 days (confirmed on two clinical examinations 1 week apart by study or clinic staff). Treatment was recommenced if discharge becomes present again.</p>

                <title>Safety monitoring</title>
                <p id="Par28">Serious adverse and medically significant events including reactogenicity were regularly monitored. Serious local or systemic reactions were noted at the time of randomisation, on day three and regularly throughout the trial by reviewing all presentations to the clinic and hospital and asking standardised questions (in person or by phone call) to the families. All adverse events were reviewed by an independent data safety monitory board (iDSMB), and reported to the ethics committees. The iDSMB, its quorum and detailed study stopping rules were established prior to the commencement of the study and are included in the study protocol. No modifications to the protocol would be made without the approval of the chief investigator and communication with all investigators and other adjudicating bodies including the iDSMB, ethics committees and Indigenous reference group.</p>

                <p id="Par29">The primary outcome measure was the proportion of children with clinical failure after 16 weeks (4 months) of treatment. Clinical failure was determined by clinical examination for the presence of any ear discharge. Additional secondary outcome measures at 4 months and 12 months included: i) hearing level, determined by audiometry (performed by trained audiologists) and summarised as the pure tone 4 frequency average hearing level at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz in the better and worse hearing ears; ii) failure to improve (determined by perforation size and amount of discharge); iii) change in perforation size and amount of discharge (determined by comparison of standardised assessment at baseline with end of study); iv) time to cessation of discharge (determined by review of health records); v) adherence to recommended management including attendance for specialist review (determined by review of health records); vi) presence of recognised bacterial pathogens in nose and ear discharge (determined by standard microbiological culture and antimicrobial sensitivity methods); vii) complications (defined as development of a related illness requiring additional medical treatment); and viii) side effects (defined as development of illness requiring cessation of prescribed treatments). Additional secondary outcomes at 4 months and 12 months from randomisation included the proportion of children with any carriage of pneumococci and any carriage of vaccine or non- vaccine serotype pneumococci and any carriage of NTHi. All children were followed up for any adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) by reviewing the child’s clinic and hospital records and asking the parents about any side effects of the treatments between and at visits. We documented any contact the family or child had during the study with the clinic or hospital, including all relevant investigations and treatments. Regular, scheduled home visits, phone calls, SMS texts and social media contact with the families were made and recorded by study nurses or community researchers to support and promote participant retention; and monitor adherence.</p>

              <p id="Par39">Because of the persistent, chronic nature of CSOM, treatment remains challenging and arduous for clinicians and families. Current best practice treatment of CSOM is not very effective. This means that CSOM remains unacceptably common and severe in Aboriginal children. Improved treatments are necessary. This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of two adjunctive treatments in addition to standard treatment and report clinical, microbiological and hearing outcomes. The results of this trial will become the best available evidence to guide the medical treatment of Indigenous children with CSOM. Outcomes of this research will be disseminated to participants, their communities and all stakeholders in person (where possible) and by publication.</p>
