                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Lifestyle risk behaviours, including alcohol use, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, poor sleep (duration and/or quality) and sedentary recreational screen time (‘the Big 6’), are strong determinants of chronic disease. These behaviours often emerge during adolescence and co-occur. School-based interventions have the potential to address risk factors prior to the onset of disease, yet few eHealth school-based interventions target multiple behaviours concurrently. This paper describes the protocol of the <italic>Health4Life Initiative</italic>, an eHealth school-based intervention that concurrently addresses the Big 6 risk behaviours among secondary school students.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A multisite cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among year 7 students (11–13 years old) from 72 Australian schools. Stratified block randomisation will be used to assign schools to either the <italic>Health4Life</italic> intervention or an active control (health education as usual). <italic>Health4Life</italic> consists of (1) six web-based cartoon modules and accompanying activities delivered during health education (once per week for 6 weeks), and a smartphone application (universal prevention), and (2) additional app content, for students engaging in two or more risk behaviours when they are in years 8 and 9 (selective prevention). Students will complete online self-report questionnaires at baseline, post intervention, and 12, 24 and 36 months after baseline. Primary outcomes are consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sleep duration, sedentary recreational screen time and uptake of alcohol and tobacco use.</p>

              <p>Lifestyle risk behaviours, including alcohol use, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, poor sleep (long or short duration and/or poor quality) and sedentary recreational screen time (the ‘Big 6’), are among the strongest determinants of chronic disease, the leading cause of death worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These risk behaviours typically emerge in adolescence and track into adulthood.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Among Australian adolescents (aged 12–17 years), 66% have consumed alcohol, 18% have smoked tobacco,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> 82% do not meet physical activity guidelines,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> 86% do not meet screen time guidelines,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> 52% of 15–16 years old do not meet minimum sleep guidelines<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and 61% of 14–18 years old consume sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in a single day.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> These risk behaviours are associated with poor health outcomes in adolescence, such as obesity<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and mental health problems,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and collectively, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, mental disorders and all-cause mortality in adults.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 10 11</xref>
</p>
              <p>Not only is each of these risk factors prevalent on its own, but they tend to co-occur.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> For example, young people who use alcohol and other drugs are also more likely to eat poorly and be sedentary.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Importantly, engaging in multiple risk behaviours increases the risk of chronic disease and mortality, more so than the additive effects of single behaviours,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> and has been associated with higher rates of mental health problems.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In recognition of this, interventions targeting changes in multiple health behaviours concurrently<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> are now being designed. This approach is grounded in ‘transfer theory’,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in which new skills and knowledge that facilitate change in one behaviour are transferred to another context,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> resulting in a ‘tag-along’ healthy change in other behaviours without additional effort.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> In addition, previous research suggests that multiple health behaviour change interventions for adolescents are potentially more efficient<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and cost effective<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> than interventions targeting single behaviours.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref>
</p>
              <p>Schools are ideal settings to implement healthy lifestyle interventions as they provide access to large numbers of students at a critical time period, are the place where students spend most of their waking hours, and, in many countries, including Australia, have a mandated health education curriculum. Further, they have been shown to be effective settings for the promotion of multiple health behaviour change.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> eHealth interventions (ie, delivered via the internet, computers, tablets, mobile technology, or tele-health) delivered at school may offer a number of potential advantages, including increased engagement, fidelity and scalability.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> When looking specifically at eHealth school-based programmes targeting multiple lifestyle risk behaviours, a recent meta-analysis<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> found such interventions to be effective in relation to diet, physical activity and screen time; however, effects were small and short-lived and studies were generally of low quality. Further, there were no existing eHealth school-based interventions that targeted all of the Big 6. Given these findings, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using large, representative samples to test the effectiveness of eHealth school-based programmes targeting multiple lifestyle risk behaviours are needed.</p>
              <p>To address these gaps, we developed the <italic>Health4Life Initiative,</italic> an eHealth intervention that aims to empower adolescents to reduce chronic disease risk, and improve current physical and mental health, by simultaneously targeting the Big 6 risk factors. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of <italic>Health4Life</italic> among adolescents through a multisite cluster RCT. It is hypothesised that <italic>Health4Life</italic> will be more effective than an active control group (health education as usual) in:</p>

                <p>A cluster RCT will be conducted among year 7 students at 72 independent, catholic and government secondary schools in New South Wales (NSW), Western Australia (WA) and Queensland (QLD), Australia, from 2019 to 2022. Due to differences in the number of available schools across states, half of the sample will be recruited from NSW (25% from Greater Sydney and 25% from other regions), while 25% will be recruited each from WA and QLD. Cluster randomisation will be used to avoid contamination of the control group with the intervention group through student and staff communication. Schools will be randomly allocated to either the <italic>Health4Life</italic> intervention or to an active control group (health education as usual). The protocol was written in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials statement.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculations</title>
                <p>The minimal detectable effect size associated with the health behaviours at the final time point (ie, 36 months) was estimated using power calculations developed by Heo and Leon<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> for linear mixed regression models taking into account the longitudinal and clustered nature of the data. The alpha level was set at a conservative 0.008 level based on a Bonferroni correction (a=0.05/6) to account for testing of multiple outcomes. Power was set at 0.8; the correlation among level 1 data (repeated measurements over time within student) was set at 0.60 and the number of time points set at 5. The formula described by Heo and Leon<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> does not require estimates of intraclass correlation coefficients at the student (level 2) or school (level 3) level. Analysis will be undertaken within each state separately and thus the trial will be powered to detect an effect size in the states with the smallest recruitment numbers. Data will also be pooled across states and analysed. With an anticipated student retention rate of 70% in each school, we plan to recruit 100 students from 72 schools (36 schools in NSW, with 18 from Greater Sydney and 18 from other regions, for example, Hunter and Illawarra, and 18 each in WA and QLD) to achieve sufficient power to detect an effect size of 0.158. An effect size of 0.158 is based on the targeted behaviour with the lowest anticipated prevalence at baseline, that is, alcohol use. An effect size of 0.158 is associated with an OR of 0.75 and is a conservative estimate compared with previous school-based trials of universal substance use prevention programmes.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Economic modelling indicates that even small effects for alcohol education programmes can have substantial benefits on a population level.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>

                  <p>Following school consent, randomisation, stratifying by state/region and school gender mix (coeducational, predominately male (&gt;60%), or predominately female (&gt;60%)) will be conducted. A biostatistician with no role in school recruitment will randomise schools using the Blockrand function in R. The randomisation scheme will be weighted by the total pool of available schools per state/region such that 50% of the total number of schools recruited to the trial will be recruited from NSW (25% from Greater Sydney and 25% from other regions), while 25% will be recruited each from WA and QLD. As is the case for school-based interventions of this kind, students, teachers and research assistants will not be blind to intervention allocation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> provides an overview of the recruitment and randomisation process.</p>

                  <p>Participating schools will be asked to distribute information and consent forms to the parents/guardians via hardcopy or electronically (depending on school preference). Due to differing requirements across ethics committees, some schools will use opt-out (passive) parental consent procedures, while others will require opt-in (active) parental consent. If insufficient opt-in written parent consent is obtained from a school, verbal parental consent will then be sought from the remaining parents by a designated school staff member using contact details available to the school. School staff members who obtain verbal consent will either be reimbursed for their time and effort, or the school will be reimbursed the costs of employing a casual teacher for a day. Students will be provided online participant information statements and required to actively consent prior to the baseline assessment.

This staged prevention approach aims to deter risk factors from emerging in the first place, as well as providing additional support to youth showing indicators of emerging risk behaviours as they progress throughout high school.</p>

Modules are ideally delivered once per week for a period of 6 weeks. Guided by an overarching multiple health behaviour change approach,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the Health4Life programme uses principles of social influence,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> social cognitive<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and self-determination theories,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and the two-process model of sleep<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41</xref> to prevent the Big 6 risk behaviours. The key behaviour change techniques woven into the cartoon modules include providing students with evidence-based information about the Big 6 risk factors, improving resistance skills, modifying existing norms, developing life skills (eg, decision-making, problem-solving, coping skills, self-control), self-regulatory skills (eg, goal setting, self-monitoring, decision-making), competence, relatedness and autonomy, and increasing autonomous motivation. Importantly, the cartoons aim to demonstrate the associations and interrelations between multiple health behaviours, for example, how increasing physical activity can improve sleep. Further information about the Health4Life content and development process is published elsewhere.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The modules are completed individually by students and short online quizzes are embedded at the end of each module to test knowledge. Teachers and students are provided with factsheets for each module to reinforce key content and teachers are also provided with a selection of optional activities (eg, online worksheets and games, group discussions, homework tasks) to implement with their students after the cartoon (approximately 20 min). An overview of the Health4Life content is provided in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.</p>

                  <p>Students also receive web-based tailored feedback immediately after completing the online assessments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>). Using a traffic light system, students are provided colour-coded strengths-based feedback about each of the Big 6. The feedback aims to help students to identify behaviours to increase, decrease or maintain. Using this system, ‘green’ notifications will be provided to students when they are meeting national guidelines for a behaviour (‘Going Strong’), ‘orange’ notifications will be sent to students when they are exhibiting some risk or are not yet meeting the guideline, but are close (‘Needs some work’) and ‘red’ notifications are provided to students when their behaviour is considered most at risk (‘Action required’). All intervention materials will be accessed via the study website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.health4life.org.au">www.health4life.org.au</ext-link>). The programme is aligned with the Australian Health and Physical Education and NSW Personal Development, Health and Physical Education curricula, and is delivered during year 7 health education classes, approximately once per week over 6 weeks. Teachers will be provided with online implementation guidelines and an opportunity to meet with researchers (face-to-face or via video conference) to assist in navigating the website and integrating the programme into their lesson plans; however, no formal teacher training is required.</p>

                  <p>To reinforce content taught in the school-based programme and encourage uptake of healthy behaviours, an accompanying smartphone app will be made available to students (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5</xref>). All students in the intervention group will be invited to download the <italic>Health4Life</italic> app and to use the app outside of the classroom. The app is also accessible on tablet devices to encourage ease of access for all students. The app prompts students to enter data to monitor their physical activity, sedentary recreational screen time, dietary intake (servings of fruit/vegetables, SSBs and discretionary food items), abstinence from using alcohol and tobacco, sleep duration and mood, and to view their progress over time. The app also includes goal-setting opportunities and provides motivational quotes and badges/rewards. Students are able to choose how often to use the app; it is anticipated that logging health behaviours would take no more than 10 min/day. Students will be reminded that they can continue to use the <italic>Health4Life</italic> app to monitor their behaviour, track their progress and set goals throughout the study period.</p>

                  <title>The Health4Life selective intervention</title>
                  <p>Students who are identified as most ‘at risk’ for two or more health behaviours at the 12-month and/or 24-month follow-up assessment will be invited to access the selective intervention, which consists of additional, tailored content via the Health4Life app or study website. That is, students who fall into the ‘red’ category (‘action required’) for two or more risk behaviours using the traffic light system described earlier will be offered access to the additional content when they are in years 8 and 9, respectively. Based on the WHO four-level approach to school change,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> we expect that approximately 30% of students will require this tier of intervention. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> outlines the specific risk thresholds that were developed by the expert advisory group, based on the best available evidence, to target the most at-risk individuals for each behaviour. The sleep threshold was based on the ‘Not Recommended’ categories for young people aged 5–13 years and 14–17 years, published by the Sleep Health Foundation.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The sedentary recreational screen time threshold was set at &gt;4 hours, as research suggests that most young people spend 2–4 hours/day engaging in sedentary recreational screen time.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> As only 18% of 12–17 years old achieve the recommended 60 min of MVPA each day,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> the physical activity threshold was set at 0, 1 or 2 days of 60 min of MVPA in a week. However, given national guidelines state that not drinking is the safest option for this age group, and there is no formal guideline for tobacco use; consumption of a full standard alcoholic drink and any tobacco in the past 6 months was considered at risk. Finally, national guidelines recommend limiting intake of SSBs,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> so high intake (5–6 cups/week or 1 or more cups/day) was considered at risk. Additionally, in recognition of the importance of other key dietary behaviours, a composite risk score based on fruit, vegetable and discretionary food intake could also result in screening into the selective intervention.</p>

Eligible youth will receive an email and SMS from the research team and ‘push notifications’ on their smartphones advising them that they can access additional content within the app or the study website to teach them new skills. Designed to be used outside of the classroom setting, the additional content includes tailored education about the Big 6 and uses cognitive behavioural and motivational enhancement techniques to assist students to develop coping strategies and skills to facilitate adoption of health behaviours within their current environment. The selective intervention consists of seven 25 min modules (one for each of the Big 6 and one introductory module). Students will have ongoing access to the selective intervention for the remainder of the study period, with the recommendation that they access it at least once per week until they have completed each module once.</p>

Conditional models will evaluate whether the intervention has a significant effect (using two-tailed tests of significance) on the change in health behaviours. Models will be estimated using robust maximum likelihood estimation to account for any effects of non-normality and non-independence of the outcomes. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, retaining and analysing all students in the groups they were originally allocated. Follow-up exploratory statistical analyses will be carried out to determine whether there is a dose–response relationship between the number of modules students complete and each outcome. Missing data will be explored and if it is reasonable to assume a missing at random structure, will be handled using full information maximum likelihood which yield more efficient, and less biased, parameter estimates than traditional methods of handling missing data.</p>

The multimodal combination of universal and selective prevention within the one integrated intervention is both novel and at the forefront of prevention in chronic disease. Addressing the Big 6 risk factors during adolescence not only has the potential to improve the health of young Australians in the short term, but also to enhance their capacity to lead healthy lives as adults later in life and reduce their risk of developing chronic disease. By adopting a multiple health behaviour change approach, the Health4Life intervention is a potentially powerful and efficient tool to maximise health outcomes. This evidence-based programme is novel, feasible and scalable to meet the needs of a large number of young people across the country. The online delivery of Health4Life ensures that it has potential to be scaled Australia wide to provide consistent, evidence-based, prevention-focussed health education. To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, the Health4Life study will prioritise recruitment in multiple states, multiple remoteness classifications and multiple school-types Australia wide. However, given the scale of the study, a key limitation includes the reliance on self-report measures and the lack of anthropometric and objective measurement. Nevertheless, this study has the potential to make a substantial public health impact by delaying the growth of the Big 6, thereby reducing the incidence of chronic disease and minimising the associated disability and early mortality.</p>
