                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Current hyponatraemia guidelines are divided on the use of tolvaptan in hospitalised patients with moderate to severe hyponatraemia, due to an uncertain risk-benefit ratio. We will conduct a randomised trial to test the hypothesis that early use of tolvaptan improves the rate of serum sodium correction and clinical outcomes compared with current standard first-line therapy, restriction of fluid intake, without increasing the risk of serum sodium overcorrection.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will enrol hospitalised patients with euvolaemic or hypervolaemic hyponatraemia and serum sodium of 115–130 mmol/L at Austin Health, a tertiary care centre in Melbourne, Australia. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive either tolvaptan (initial dose 7.5 mg) or fluid restriction (initial limit 1000 ml per 24 h), with titration of therapy based on serum sodium response according to a pre-determined protocol over a 72-h intervention period.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary endpoint will be the between-group change in serum sodium over time, from study day 1 to day 4. Secondary endpoints include serum sodium increment in the first 24 and 48 h, proportion of participants with normalised serum sodium, length of hospital stay, requirement for serum sodium re-lowering with intravenous dextrose or desmopressin, cognitive and functional measures (Confusion Assessment Method Short form, Timed Up and Go test, hyponatraemia symptom questionnaire), 30-day readmission rate, treatment satisfaction score and serum sodium 30 days after discharge. The trial will be overseen by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. Serum sodium will be monitored every 6–12 h throughout the study period, with pre-specified thresholds for commencing intravenous 5% dextrose if serum sodium rise targets are exceeded.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">We seek to inform future international guidelines with high-quality data regarding the utility and safety of tolvaptan compared to standard therapy fluid restriction in patients with moderate-severe hyponatraemia in hospital. If tolvaptan use in this patient group is endorsed by our findings, we will have established an evidence-based framework for tolvaptan initiation and monitoring to guide its use.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par25">Low serum sodium, known as hyponatraemia, is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting 15–30% of acute hospital inpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Severe hyponatraemia can have serious acute complications due to cerebral oedema, and even mild to moderate hyponatraemia is associated with falls, delirium and increased length of hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hyponatraemia at hospital admission is associated with increased inpatient mortality, though causation is not established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">‘Severe’ hyponatraemia is defined by the presence of severe symptoms such as vomiting, seizure and reduced conscious state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Biochemically, hyponatraemia can be classified as mild (Na 130–135 mmol/L), moderate (125–129 mmol/L) or profound (&lt; 125 mmol/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A critical consideration in the management of moderate-profound hyponatraemia of duration &gt; 48 h (or unknown) is the need to avoid rapid correction which may lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome and permanent neurological disability. Guidelines recommended aiming to increase serum sodium by 5–8 mmol/L per day, and not to exceed 10 mmol/L per 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">Current guideline-directed management of hyponatraemia is largely based on expert opinion and has limitations. Most cases of euvolaemic or hypervolaemic hyponatraemia are perpetuated by non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH)), causing water retention. This condition is known as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Fluid restriction is the first-line treatment for patients with hyponatraemia who are not hypovolaemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This treatment can be difficult to reliably administer because of the need for supervision, and for competing therapies requiring fluid administration. Fluid restriction is ineffective in approximately 50% of cases and may lead to reduced compliance and poor quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">Tolvaptan is an oral vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist that blocks AVP action in the kidney, inducing a water diuresis to raise serum sodium concentration. The efficacy of tolvaptan versus placebo (without fluid restriction) was established in the SALT-1 and SALT-2 trials in patients with mild-to-moderate hyponatraemia (mean baseline serum sodium 129.0 (SD 4.1) mmol/L). The SALT trials did not enrol acutely hospitalised patients; rather, patients with chronic hyponatraemia were electively admitted for the purpose of trial initiation, and patients with serum sodium less than 120 mmol/L and neurological symptoms were excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Tolvaptan was approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration in 2009 for treatment of clinically significant hypervolaemic or euvolaemic hyponatraemia, defined as serum sodium &lt; 125 mmol/L, or hyponatraemia that is symptomatic and has resisted correction with fluid restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The sodium cut-off recommendation from the FDA approval is not clearly evidence-based and instead is based on expert opinion regarding which patients with hyponatraemia are likely to benefit from treatment in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">Off-label experience with tolvaptan post-approval has identified benefits and risks. While the SALT trials reported excessively rapid correction of hyponatraemia (rise in sodium &gt; 12 mmol in 24 h) in 1.7% of tolvaptan-treated patients (5.6% of an SIAD subgroup), observational studies of tolvaptan in moderate-to-profound hyponatraemia have shown highly variable rates of biochemical overcorrection in patients with initial serum Na &lt; 125 mmol/L, ranging from 0 to 30% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. An international hyponatraemia registry observed overcorrection of serum sodium in 12.1% of cases of tolvaptan use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This experience has led some to recommend reduced initial dosing of tolvaptan (e.g. 7.5 mg) to improve its safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. At least one case of osmotic demyelination due to tolvaptan has been published, in a patient with decompensated cardiac failure in whom tolvaptan was inappropriately continued for several days despite a large initial rise in serum sodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">Currently, tolvaptan use in hospitalised patients with moderate to profound hyponatraemia is not evidence-based as there are no randomised controlled trials comparing the use of tolvaptan in hospitalised patients against standard of care fluid restriction. International guidelines are divided on the use of tolvaptan in hyponatraemia with lower sodium concentrations, due to concern regarding risk of sodium overcorrection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. European guidelines recommend against the use of tolvaptan in moderate-profound hyponatraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], whereas US/Irish guidelines acknowledge that there is insufficient evidence for tolvaptan use with serum sodium &lt; 120 mmol/L, but endorse its use with appropriate monitoring of serum sodium levels, and prompt intervention if the recommended rate of serum sodium increase is exceeded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Other potential concerns raised about tolvaptan include cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and risk of liver function derangement seen with sustained higher-dose tolvaptan therapy for other indications (e.g. autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">Thus, there is a critical evidence gap with respect to efficacy and safety of tolvaptan in the very patients for whom it would be most useful. As such, there is physician reluctance to use what may be a safe and more efficacious therapy than fluid restriction if prescribed appropriately. There is an international need for rigorous randomised comparisons between tolvaptan and fluid restriction to determine evidence-based protocols for the use of tolvaptan in hospital inpatients with moderate to profound hyponatraemia, to clarify its role and ensure optimal patient outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par69">We seek to determine the utility of tolvaptan in real-world practice through comparison with current standard therapy. While the original SALT trials of tolvaptan were placebo-controlled, these were conducted in ambulatory patients with chronic mild-moderate hyponatraemia (serum sodium 125–135 mmol/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The choice of placebo or no intervention would not be a clinically useful or ethical comparison in our population of interest with moderate-to-profound hyponatraemia, as it may risk harm in these patients by delaying treatment.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">To reflect real-world practice and for safety, both tolvaptan and fluid restriction will be titrated according to a protocol that allows for escalation and de-escalation of treatment according to serum sodium response in a pre-specified manner.</p>
                  <p id="Par71">Tolvaptan (Samsca) is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist. It is approved in Australia for treatment of clinically significant hypervolaemic or euvolaemic hyponatraemia (serum sodium less than 125 mmol/L, or less marked hyponatraemia that is symptomatic and has resisted correction with fluid restriction) including patients with heart failure and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Australia, Tolvaptan is supplied by Otsuka Australia Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd. Detailed pharmacodynamic information, pharmacokinetic information, adverse effects, contraindications and warnings are available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Appendix 3.</p>
                  <p id="Par72">The SALT trials of Tolvaptan versus placebo utilised an escalating dose protocol, with initial dose 15 mg able to be increased to 30 mg then 60 mg in the event of inadequate initial response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The proportion of patients requiring higher doses was not reported. We have chosen a lower starting dose of tolvaptan 7.5 mg in line with post-marking observational studies that have shown reduced rates of serum sodium rise &gt; 12 mmol/24 h with this lower dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While use of an even lower dose of tolvaptan 3.75 mg has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the triangular shape in Australia of the lowest-available 15-mg tablet means that it cannot be accurately quartered, leading to selection of 7.5 mg as our starting dose to balance safety, efficacy and practical considerations.</p>
                  <p id="Par73">Fluid restriction is the standard initial therapy for euvolaemic hyponatraemia, supported by international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While the quantity of fluid restriction is not always specified, an initial fluid restriction limit of 1.0 L (1000 ml) per 24 h is evidence-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Titration of the fluid restriction, in the form of pre-specified reduction in fluid restriction limit if sodium correction targets are not met, has been included in this protocol to reflect current clinical practice and ensure adequacy of treatment. US recommendations suggest down-titration of fluid restriction to 500 ml below 24-h urine output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and there is evidence for use of fluid restrictions in the range of 500–1000 ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We have opted for sequential restriction limits of 750 ml, 500 ml or 0 ml per 24 h total fluid intake for consistency.</p>

                  <p id="Par75">Subsequent daily study visits will evaluate the change in serum sodium over the previous 24 h, reassess volume status and then determine the dosage of tolvaptan or the limit of fluid restriction for that study day, depending on allocation. Early morning bloods will facilitate morning decision-making. Participants whose sodium level increases at the desired rate 5–8 mmol/L over 24 h will continue the same dose of their intervention. Participants whose serum sodium rise is below target will have escalation of intervention—either tolvaptan dose increase (e.g. from 7.5 to 15 mg), or reduction of fluid restriction limit (e.g. 1000 to 750 mL). Participants with decreased serum sodium despite their initial intervention will have more rapid escalation of intervention dosing (e.g. tolvaptan from 7.5 to 30 mg; or fluid restriction from 1000 to 500 ml). Participants who record a 24-h serum sodium rise &gt; 8 mmol/L (or have required intravenous dextrose due to Na &gt; 8 mmol above target during the 24-h period) will not receive either tolvaptan or fluid restriction the following day. Participants who achieve normalisation of serum sodium concentration (135 mmol/L or above) during the course of the trial from either arm will default to a 1500 mL ‘maintenance’ fluid restriction, unless the rise in serum Na was &gt; 8 mmol, in which case they will have free fluid intake.</p>
                  <p id="Par76">Tolvaptan doses will be administered prior to 1200 (ideally prior to 1000) to allow safe monitoring of effect during daytime hours with serum sodium measurement 6 and 12 h post dose.</p>
                  <p id="Par77">Direct sodium measurement from venous blood gas samples will be preferred to determine outcomes and treatment decisions, unless this is not available. In the setting of glucose levels &gt; 10 mmol/L (&gt; 180 m/dl), a correction factor will be applied according to the formula published by Hillier and colleagues in 1999 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], as endorsed by the European hyponatraemia guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This formula adds 2.4 mmol/l to the measured serum sodium concentration for every 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) incremental rise in serum glucose. For glucose levels below 10, this amounts to correction by 1 mmol/L or less, therefore for we have chosen to implement this correction for glucose &gt; 10 mmol/L only for practical purposes.

The first is a visual analogue scale scored from 1 to 10 that asks participants to rate their headache, nausea and unsteadiness respectively. Participants will indicate the visual location along a bar from 0 ‘none at all’ to 10 ‘worst you can imagine’. The RedCAP software will calculate a score from 1 to 10 to two decimal places based on the placement of the slider by the participant for each of the three potential symptoms. The second component is the Hyponatraemia Disease-Specific Survey (HDSS), adapted from pre-specified but exploratory symptom evaluation in the SALT-2 tolvaptan trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There are some similarities to the SF-12 Short Form Health Survey which evaluated wellbeing in both SALT trials; however, that tool is not hyponatraemia-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In the HDSS, participants are asked to rate their health over the past day (excellent, very good, good, fair or poor). They are then asked how much their thinking ability has been limited, specifically: Concentrating, Calculating, Language and Memory ability (not at all, slightly, moderately, quite a bit, extremely), which will be scored from 0 to 4 to derive a ‘mental component summary score’ from 0 to 16 (higher score indicating higher level of self-identified limitation). Participants then rate how their strength and coordination has been limited, specifically Endurance, Strength, Gross coordination and Fine coordination (not at all, slightly, moderately, quite a bit or extremely), which are also attributed a number to derive a physical component score 0–16. Additional questions include self-perception of current sodium level without prompting by knowledge of their laboratory test (very low, a little low, normal). Participants are also asked to rate their level of thirst sensation (not thirsty, a little thirsty, normal thirst, extra thirst, very thirsty) and to provide an assessment of their progress ‘Overall, compared to before you came to hospital, how much better do you feel?’ (much better, somewhat better, about the same, somewhat worse or much worse).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par125">Tolvaptan has the potential to have great utility in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-profound hyponatraemia, but its uptake has been limited by lack of evidence for such patients. In additional, there are concerns regarding safety, level of benefit and potential cost. The absence of evidence is reflected in the divergent recommendations in current hyponatraemia guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par126">Hyponatraemia is a common clinical management problem, and until recently, the complexity and need for individualised therapy may have contributed to a lack of reliable evidence in this field.</p>
              <p id="Par127">Recent research has interrogated traditional management to provide an evidence base for fluid restriction in trial conditions and has reported limitations with this first line approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our study will provide a randomised comparison of tolvaptan and fluid restriction, which, despite observational trials and growing clinical experience, is yet to be formally evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par128">Limitations of this study include its open-label design, necessary use of an unvalidated hyponatraemia symptom questionnaire, and single-centre operation. Another limitation common to all trials in hyponatraemia in hospital is that a proportion of patients with SIAD may improve spontaneously without, or despite, intervention, due to resolution of the underlying cause of non-osmotic vasopressin release. We are mitigating this issue by delaying recruitment at least 24–48 h after hyponatraemia is identified. Strengths of this trial include its prospective, randomised design, and a pre-specified protocol to reassess and titrate interventions daily, in keeping with clinical practice. Another strength is use of the increasingly recommended lower dose 7.5 mg of tolvaptan that has not been assessed in previous randomised trials.</p>
              <p id="Par129">Tolvaptan is known to be efficacious in raising sodium concentration, and we therefore seek to quantify its benefit and establish its safety in raising serum sodium concentrations in moderate to profound hyponatraemia in replicable conditions, with protocolised dosing and monitoring. Any benefit in cognitive and functional outcomes, reduction in length of hospital stay or reassuring safety information would provide additional rationale for tolvaptan use, which may be required to overcome the immediate cost advantage and accessibility of fluid restriction. We hope to clarify the utility of tolvaptan in clinical practice and inform international guidelines with high-quality data, and provide an evidence-based framework for tolvaptan initiation and monitoring.</p>
