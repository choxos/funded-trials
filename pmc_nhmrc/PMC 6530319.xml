                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Despite the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) worldwide, many people with the condition do not receive evidence-based care or achieve the best possible outcomes. There is a gap in the dissemination of evidence-based information across the globe. The advent of the internet has changed the way people obtain health information. As such, trustworthy, tailored and validated LBP resources may help bridge the gap. This study aims to measure the effectiveness of a new website (MyBackPain) in improving spinal health literacy, treatment preferences and clinical outcomes for people with LBP, in comparison with other online resources.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This online, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial will comprise 440 people with non-specific LBP of any duration. In addition to access to publicly available online information (control group), the intervention group will be given access to the MyBackPain.org.au website. Participants and research staff, including the biostatistician, will be blinded to treatment allocation. Data will be collected at baseline, 1, 3 (primary end-point), 6 and 12 months via online surveys and questionnaires. The primary outcome is spinal health literacy. Secondary outcomes include quality of treatment preferences (stated and observed) and LBP clinical outcomes (pain, disability and quality of life). Analyses will be by intention-to-treat and include outcome data on all randomised participants. Descriptive statistics will be presented for demographic and clinical characteristics.</p>

              <p>According to the global burden of disease study, low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> placing an enormous burden on individuals and economies. Up to 80% of individuals experience LBP at least once in their lifetime<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and when it persists it accounts for 30% of all chronic pain.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Total annual expenditure in Australia includes approximately $4.8 billion in direct costs<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and over $8 billion in indirect costs.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Much of this burden involves unnecessary and ineffective assessments and treatments.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The impact of LBP is worsened by negative messages and beliefs, and poor-quality management.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Early education and access to the most effective treatments could reduce much of this excessive burden. There is a clear role for a LBP education/guidance portal to empower patients to optimise active participation in their negotiation of treatments and healthcare providers.</p>
              <p>People increasingly use the internet to obtain health-related information.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> It has great potential to educate and engage patients in the management of health conditions. People with LBP consistently report a desire for trustworthy information about their condition<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref> and the internet, with its capacity to provide tailored information in varied formats at a time and place of the user’s choosing, is ideal to provide such information. Positive features of internet use include the potential for patients to become better informed about their condition and potential treatment options,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref> to become more engaged with their treatment<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and to improve health outcomes with more appropriate use of health resources.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 20 21</xref> Access and reflection on information prior to clinical visits could also ensure efficient use of clinical consultation time,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 20</xref> enhance relationships between patients and clinicians<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and foster informed decision-making.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
              <p>When evaluated against criteria developed from relevant guidelines and research evidence,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref> LBP websites are consistently rated as ‘poor’ in overall quality and do not meet the expressed needs of patients with LBP (Nielsen, 2017 unpublished data). In addition, the language and terminology used on many LBP websites are not tailored to the intended audience making the information difficult for users to understand.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</p>
              <p>We have shown that people with LBP are interested in a range of information topics including diagnostic and treatment information, lay or experience-based information, practical self-help strategies, recognition and discussion of psychosocial concerns.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These are often lacking in current websites (Nielsen, 2017 unpublished data). Consumer preferences regarding presentation of information emphasise multimodality, readability, quality assurance and interactivity (Nielsen, 2017 unpublished data), none of which are satisfactorily achieved with the resources currently available.</p>
              <p>As a part of this randomised controlled trial, we have developed a comprehensive LBP website (MyBackPain.org.au) that integrates evidence-based LBP information and tailored guidance and explicitly considers the needs and preferences of individuals with LBP. The highest quality information for people with both acute and chronic LBP has been identified and distilled to easily understood resources in multiple formats (patient and clinician videos, information sheets, quizzes) and uses evidence-based algorithms to create tailored consumer guidance. The MyBackPain website is designed to improve health outcomes by: (1) enhancing consumer confidence in managing their condition and making treatment choices with emphasis on evidence-based assessments and treatments, and avoidance of investigations and treatments that are ineffective, unnecessary or harmful; (2) de-medicalising and normalising LBP with messages in multiple formats that reinforce that back pain is a natural part of life for many and in most cases can be managed with early return to activity; (3) providing tools for individuals to identify if further investigation and/or management may be required and (4) engaging patients in healthy behaviours and attitudes to reduce the burden of LBP.</p>

                <title>Aim</title>
                <p>The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the newly developed, multifaceted MyBackPain website compared with existing internet resources. We hypothesise that the MyBackPain website will be more effective than existing internet resources in improving health literacy, choice of evidence-based treatments and clinical outcomes in people with LBP.</p>

                <p>This manuscript describes a research protocol for the MyBackPain randomised controlled trial. This prospectively registered, pragmatic, online-based, randomised controlled trial with assessor and participant blinding, will recruit individuals with LBP from across Australia. Participants will be randomised to groups that could either; (1) access any existing online resources (control group) or (2) have access to the MyBackPain online resource in addition to other readily available online resources (intervention group). The comparison with self-directed use of the internet will provide a pragmatic comparison of the effects of the MyBackPain website. Central, computerised randomisation will be used to ensure allocation concealment. This protocol has been developed in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

Our partner health insurer (Medibank Private) will also make available their insurance membership cohort for recruitment purposes. This study will recruit participants with LBP from November 2017 until the sample size is achieved.</p>
                <p>Potential participants will be provided with a web-link to a page that provides the participant information sheet and consent form where they will be asked if they have read and understood the information and if they consent to participate in the trial. Consent will be provided by checking the appropriate box. Those who consent to participate will then be directed to a screening form to determine their eligibility. Eligible participants will complete the baseline data questionnaires/surveys before randomisation into the intervention or control group. To encourage retention in the study, participants will be offered entry into a draw for an iPad mini on completion of all time points of the data collection. One iPad will be awarded for each 44 participants.</p>

The website is not publicly available and no content can be accessed without the username/password combination individually provided to participants in the intervention group, with a request not to share the website or its content with others. Participants will be able to use the website in multiple ways: self-directed browsing and searching of the content; inbuilt automated guided content tailored to the features of their presentation and identified information priorities; and the opportunity to ‘opt-in’ to receive regular emails that highlight key messages about LBP. Participants will be free to determine how, when and how often they access the website. They will be free to decide which content they use and the format they prefer (eg, text, video, patient stories etc). The website will send automated messages to encourage users to return and access additional content and refresh their knowledge if they have opted to receive the regular emails. They will be encouraged to save information of interest to their ‘dashboard’ for easy access and print out relevant information for later reference or use in visits with their healthcare provider.</p>

These seven dimensions will be assessed using a 4-point Likert scale (1—completely disagree; 4—completely agree).</p>
                  <p>We will also investigate patient preference for a number of treatment choices mentioned in the MyBackPain website in terms of the likelihood of healthy (ie, treatments rated as strong evidence and some evidence) or unhealthy treatment choices. The treatments patients indicate as being healthy or unhealthy (stated) and the treatments they actually use (observed) will be measured in each group in three ways:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Quality of treatment preference (stated): Patient decision-making will be measured by evaluation of stated effectiveness of treatment choices. Patients will be asked to click on a 5-item scale (effective, somewhat effective, unsure, not very effective, not effective) if they think a subset of treatments discussed in the MyBackPain website are effective for people’s LBP in general (but not specifically their own pain). Treatment choices will be scored against the recommendations provided in the MyBackPain website according to the classifications of ‘good evidence’, ‘may work’, ‘not enough evidence’, ‘unlikely to work’ and ‘may be harmful’.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quality of treatment preference (observed–scored): Treatments that are used by participants will be evaluated against the recommendations provided in the MyBackPain website according to the classifications of ‘good evidence’, ‘may work’, ‘not enough evidence’, ‘unlikely to work’ and ‘may be harmful’. Participants of both groups will be asked to record weekly in the online diary any treatments received for their LBP.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quality of treatment preference (observed–proportion): The proportion of participants who choose treatments that are, according to the MyBackPain website, either recommended or considered to have no effect or be harmful in each group will be assessed separately (recommended; no effect; harmful), using data from the online participant diary.</p></list-item></list>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Analyses will be by intention-to-treat of all randomised participants who completed the baseline surveys. To assess the difference in the primary outcome between groups, longitudinal linear regression models will be fit, including all data from 1, 3, 6 and 12 months as an outcome for each participant. Models will be adjusted for baseline values of outcomes and the stratification variable symptom duration and also include a term for month, and an interaction between month and randomised group included as fixed effects, with random effects for participants. Similar longitudinal logistic regression models will be used for binary outcomes. These models will be interrogated to yield differences between groups at each time point. Standard diagnostic plots will be used to assess regression assumptions. Descriptive statistics on demographics and clinical characteristics will be presented for both the control and intervention group as the mean change (SD, 95% CI) or counts and percentages for categorical variables. Multiple imputation methodology will be employed to account for missing data. No statistical adjustment will be made for multiple testing. All tests will be carried out at the 5% level of significance.</p>
                <p>Sample size calculation is based on an effect size of 0.30, for ‘having sufficient information to manage my health’ and ‘actively managing my health’ dimensions of the HLQ. A sample size of 440 participants (minimum of 25% acute participants) will achieve 80% power to detect the desired effect size, allowing for a conservative loss to follow-up rate of 20% at 3 months.</p>
