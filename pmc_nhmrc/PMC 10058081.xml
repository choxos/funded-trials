                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Mass drug administration (MDA) based on two doses of ivermectin, one week apart, substantially reduces prevalence of both scabies and impetigo. The Regimens of Ivermectin for Scabies Elimination (RISE) trial assessed whether one-dose ivermectin-based MDA would be as effective.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>RISE was a cluster-randomised trial in Solomon Islands. We assigned 20 villages in a 1:1 ratio to one- or two-dose ivermectin-based MDA. We planned to test whether the impact of one dose on scabies prevalence at 12 and 24 months was non-inferior to two, at a 5% non-inferiority margin.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We deferred endpoint assessment to 21 months due to COVID-19. We enrolled 5239 participants in 20 villages at baseline and 3369 at 21 months from an estimated population of 5500. At baseline scabies prevalence was similar in the two arms (one-dose 17·2%; two-dose 13·2%). At 21 months, there was no reduction in scabies prevalence (one-dose 18·7%; two-dose 13·4%), and the confidence interval around the difference included values substantially greater than 5%. There was however a reduction in prevalence among those who had been present at the baseline assessment (one-dose 15·9%; two-dose 10·8%). Additionally, we found a reduction in both scabies severity and impetigo prevalence in both arms, to a similar degree.</p>

                <sec id="sec004">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>There was no indication of an overall decline in scabies prevalence in either arm. The reduction in scabies prevalence in those present at baseline suggests that the unexpectedly high influx of people into the trial villages, likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have compromised the effectiveness of the MDA. Despite the lack of effect there are important lessons to be learnt from this trial about conducting MDA for scabies in high prevalence settings.</p>

                <p>We conducted a trial of one versus two doses of ivermectin based mass drug administration (MDA) for the control of scabies. We found that no reduction in scabies prevalence in either the one or two dose arms. However there was a reduction in the severity of scabies and prevalence of impetigo in both arms, to a similar degree.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Scabies, recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) since 2017, has an estimated annual global incidence of 455 million cases [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Higher levels of endemic scabies largely occur in low and middle-income countries of the tropics, with Pacific island countries particularly affected [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disease is caused by infestation with the mite <italic toggle="yes">Sarcoptes scabiei</italic> var. <italic toggle="yes">hominis</italic>, which burrows into the skin causing skin lesions and intense itch. The resulting breaches in the skin barrier can lead to secondary bacterial infections of skin and soft tissue structures, most commonly as impetigo. Serious immune-mediated complications from <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> impetigo can occur, including acute glomerulonephritis and possibly acute rheumatic fever [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>The public health strategy of mass drug administration (MDA), which involves treating the whole population for a disease, regardless of symptoms or other diagnostic indicators, has been widely used for the control and elimination of a number of globally important NTDs [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A growing body of evidence supporting the use of MDA for scabies in high prevalence settings has led to interim guidance that it be adopted where the population prevalence of scabies is over 10% [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This guidance is based on the use of the oral antiparasitic agent ivermectin [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of individual patients with scabies recommend a second dose of ivermectin, 7–14 days after the first, to ensure killing of unhatched mites that are protected from the drug at the first dose [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At the community level, delivery of the second dose of ivermectin poses barriers to the implementation of MDA due to increased cost, complex logistics and potentially poorer adherence, particularly when populations are scattered in remote, hard-to-access villages. It is also more difficult to integrate a two-dose regimen with MDA for other NTDs that are based on one-dose regimens [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There is some evidence that one-dose MDA with ivermectin for other NTDs may have led to a reduction in scabies burden [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A recent study conducted in Fiji compared one- and two-dose ivermectin in combination with albendazole and diethylcarbamizine as MDA with a screen and treat approach, as a secondary outcome [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The nested study found that all three strategies led to a reduction in scabies prevalence. We therefore designed the Regimens of Ivermectin for Scabies Elimination (RISE) trial to assess the effectiveness of one dose of ivermectin-based MDA compared to a two dose regimen [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Ethics statement</title>
                <p>The trial had ethical approval from the Solomon Islands Health Ethics Review Board (HRE005/18) and Royal Children’s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee, Melbourne, Australia (38099A), and was prospectively registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12618001086257. We obtained written informed consent from all participants aged 18 years and above, and from parents/guardians of those aged less than 18 years.</p>
                <p>We conducted this study in Western Province in Solomon Islands, a Pacific island country with an estimated population in 2021 of around 700,000 people [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The study was conducted in partnership with the Western Provincial Health Services. We used an open-label, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority design in 20 villages, as described in the published protocol [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>The cluster-randomised design has been used for this study as we aim to assess the impact of a public health intervention on a community, rather than individual participants. The cluster-randomised design aims to replicate real-world conditions which can include population movement in and out of villages, coverage gaps and other factors that may influence the outcome. The study will measure the change in scabies prevalence on a village level rather than tracking individuals.</p>
                <p>Villages were randomly assigned by an independent statistician, in a 1:1 ratio, to MDA with either one dose (Arm 1) or two doses administered 7–14 days apart (Arm 2) of scabies treatment (<xref rid="pntd.0011207.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Criteria for village selection included a population between 180–300 (based on census-derived estimates), physical separation from other villages, and willingness to participate in the study as determined by consultation involving the Western Provincial Health Services and village leadership. All residents were eligible to take part in the trial. MDA was conducted from 13 May to 3 July 2019. Prevalence surveys for scabies and impetigo were conducted immediately prior to MDA (baseline) and the protocol specified repeat prevalence surveys at 12 months (primary outcome) and 24 months after MDA.</p>

                <p>MDA for scabies used directly-observed oral ivermectin in 6 mg tablets, unless there were contraindications to ivermectin, in which case topical permethrin was used. Ivermectin was dosed within a range of 150 to 250μg/kg. Height-based dosing was used for children at least 90cm tall up to the age of 14 years, ranging from 3mg to a maximum of 12mg. Intervals for height based dosing were based on previously collected Solomon Islands height and weight data (90–112 cm: 3mg; 112-138cm: 6mg; 138-156cm: 9mg; &gt;156cm:12mg). A standard dose of 12mg was used for those aged 15 years and over, but reduced to 9mg for those judged on visual assessment to be substantially underweight relative to height, and increased to 15mg for those judged to be substantially overweight [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Permethrin 5% cream was offered along with administration instructions to participants with the following contraindications to ivermectin: children aged less than 2 years or less than 90cm in height, pregnancy, breastfeeding a child under one week of age, treatment with warfarin, or severe illness. The dosing regimen for permethrin was the same as that for ivermectin and determined by the village allocation; either one dose (Arm 1) or two doses 7–14 days apart (Arm 2).</p>
                <p>Restrictions on travel and research related to the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to complete the 12-month survey. Therefore, we combined the proposed 12 and 24 month assessments into a single assessment at 21 months, which took place from 19 February to 21 April 2021. At both baseline and 21 months, clinical assessments for symptoms and signs of scabies were conducted by nurses who had received specific training on standardised guidelines [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nurses examined the arms and legs of all participants, and also the trunk in children aged less than 2 years. Based on the clinical assessments, diagnoses were made against diagnostic criteria promulgated by the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as either clinical scabies (subcategory B3 in criteria) or suspected scabies (subcategories C1 and C2). Impetigo was defined as papular, pustular or ulcerative lesions surrounded by erythema, or with crusts, pus or bullae [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We determined the severity of scabies and impetigo by the number of lesions (very mild 1–2 lesions, mild 3–10 lesions, moderate 11–50 lesions, severe &gt;50 lesions). At the 21 month survey participants were also asked whether they had participated in MDA at baseline. Individual data were entered directly into a REDCap database using Android-enabled mobile devices in the field, and securely stored at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
                <p>We also obtained routinely-collected data from the national District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2), an electronic health management information system, on presentations for scabies and total presentation for all conditions, at all Western Province health clinics for the 12 months before and 12 months after MDA. The 12 month sampling window was chosen to assess the primary outcome at 12 months as per the original study design as well as to assess any seasonal variation in scabies prevalence. Clinics were classified according to whether or not they served at least one study village. Health clinics service a combination of both study villages and non-study villages so the data collected from DHIS2 was used as a secondary measure to obtain clinic level data as a secondary outcome, not village or individual level data.</p>
                <p>Although ivermectin and permethrin are well tolerated with no safety concerns at the dose used for MDA, we undertook passive monitoring for adverse events. Participants were advised to report any adverse events to health clinics or directly to the study team and these were reported to the study coordinator. We also retrospectively reviewed mortality and stillbirth records as reported in the national DHIS2 health information system. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed these data.</p>
                <p>The sample size was calculated using a standard Monte Carlo simulation and based on the previously reported scabies prevalence in the province and the effect size in studies for ivermectin-based MDA for scabies, with a non-inferiority margin of 5% absolute difference in prevalence to achieve statistical power of 80% [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We selected a non-inferiority margin of 5% as we considered this to be relevant from a public health perspective. This was an intention-to-treat analysis.</p>
                <p>For the primary endpoint, we calculated scabies prevalence at baseline and 21 months for the two arms of the trial overall and for demographic sub-groups. The difference in scabies prevalence between baseline and 21 months was calculated for each village. The means of these differences were calculated for each study arm, and then the difference between these means, and its 95%, two-sided confidence interval was calculated. If the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the two study groups comparing baseline to 21 months was less than or equal to 5% (the clinically relevant non-inferiority margin) one-dose regimen was considered non-inferior to two doses.</p>
                <p>In further analyses, we calculated the difference in impetigo prevalence between baseline and 21 months for each study arm using the same method as we did for scabies. We compared the severity of scabies by calculating the proportion of participants with very mild, mild, moderate and severe disease and their two-sided 95% confidence interval of these at each time point and dose group. We compared the number of presentations for scabies at the health clinics with the total number of clinic presentations in the 12 months before and 12 months after MDA between clinics that serviced study villages and other health facilities in Western Province. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata (version 17·0, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p>

              <p>At baseline, the total estimated population of the 20 study villages was 5500 (<xref rid="pntd.0011207.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The In Arm 1 villages, of an estimated population of 2600, 2418 participants enrolled at baseline and 2412 received one-dose MDA. In Arm 2 villages, estimated population 2900, baseline 2842 participants enrolled at baseline, 2837 received the first dose of MDA and 2346 received a dose at the second timepoint 7–14 days later (including 189 who had not received the first dose). At 21 months, 1699 individuals were assessed in Arm 1, including 804 who reported that they had been recruited at baseline and 877 (51·6%) who reported that they had not. In Arm 2, 1692 were assessed including 1057 recruited at baseline and 622 (36·8%) new (<xref rid="pntd.0011207.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). There was a higher proportion of females than males in each arm and at both time-points, notably there was an underrepresentation of adult males in the 20–49 year old age groups (<xref rid="pntd.0011207.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was a higher proportion of children under the age of 15 years participating at 21 months compared to baseline.</p>

              <p>Impetigo prevalence was significantly lower in both arms at 21 months after MDA compared to baseline (<xref rid="pntd.0011207.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In Arm 1, prevalence was 4·6% (95% CI 3·8–5·5) at baseline and 1·3% (95% CI 0·8–2·0) at 21 months. In Arm 2, prevalence was 6·2% (95% CI 5·3–7·1) at baseline and 1·1% (95% CI 0·7–1·8) at 21 months. The difference between the two arms in the mean changes in impetigo prevalence from baseline to 21 months was 1·7% (95% CI -2·8–6·2). The majority of cases were classified as very mild or mild and there was little change in impetigo severity in either arm from baseline to 21 months.</p>
              <p>One adverse event was reported to the study team following MDA. The participant experienced nausea and vomiting which was self-resolving and did not require intervention.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this trial of one versus two doses of ivermectin for scabies control, we did not observe a change in scabies prevalence between baseline and 21 months following MDA in either arm. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the difference between the two study groups comparing baseline to 21 months was greater than 5% so we could not conclude that a single dose was non-inferior. However, there was a clear reduction in scabies severity in both arms, and clinics servicing study villages reported a modest decline in consultations for scabies in contrast to other clinics of the province which reported no change.</p>
              <p>Our initial plan to conduct follow-up visits at both 12 and 24 months had to be modified when the Solomon Islands Ministry of Health and Medical Service paused health research in 2020 to minimise risks and maximise resources directed at the COVID-19 pandemic response. The 21-month procedures were unchanged from the planned for 12 and 24 months, apart from the remote involvement of the Australia-based study coordinator (SL).</p>
              <p>The lack of reduction in scabies prevalence following ivermectin-based MDA in either arm was unexpected. In trials conducted in other provinces in Solomon Islands, we have recorded substantial declines attributed to this intervention and similar findings have been reported from studies in Fiji [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While it is possible that the results of these past studies do not accurately reflect the impact of MDA on scabies prevalence, it is more likely that other factors reduced the apparent impact of ivermectin-based MDA in our study.</p>
              <p>Other studies in the region have shown significant reduction in scabies prevalence 24 and 36 months after MDA so it is unlikely that the follow up period was too long to capture the impact of MDA [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While we did not observe a decline in scabies prevalence at 21 months, there were reductions in both severity of scabies and prevalence of impetigo. One possible explanation is that there was an initial reduction in both scabies and impetigo prevalence, but by the time the delayed follow up assessment took place at 21 months, new cases of scabies had been introduced. These new cases introduced to the participating communities may have been at a milder clinical stage of scabies infestation, thereby providing an explanation for both the reduced scabies severity and the reduced impetigo prevalence. There was a reduction in scabies prevalence among the subset of participants who reported they had been present at baseline, which also suggests that scabies cases may have been introduced into the study villages after MDA.</p>
              <p>Lower numbers of participants at 21 months, combined with a high proportion of participants in both arms reporting they had not been present during the MDA, indicate substantial movement both in and out of villages. As the study was designed to assess change in scabies prevalence at the village level, rather than the individual level, we were unable to link participant data between baseline and 21 months so relied on participants self-reporting if they had participated at baseline. There is evidence that people can accurately recall whether or not they received MDA up to 12 months after treatment, there is not published information on recall accuracy at longer time intervals [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Past studies in similar settings that have shown substantial reductions in scabies prevalence after MDA have treated whole islands, or additionally provided treatment to any new entrants to the community [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An earlier Solomon Islands study found a significant reduction in scabies up to 36 months after MDA treatment was offered to all province residents, reducing the likelihood of transmission through interaction with neighbouring villages in the province [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In 2020, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Solomon Islands Government requested that people return to their villages from urban areas, anecdotally resulting in a substantial influx of people to several study villages [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is unclear what the results would have been if this trial had not coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. In our trial, some village residents regularly attended markets in neighbouring villages to sell produce, and teenage children travelled away to boarding school, returning to the village for holidays. Logging camps established near several study villages between baseline and 21 months employed village residents. Movement of people in and out of study villages may have re-introduced scabies to these communities [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. An important lesson from this trial may be that in settings with very high prevalence of scabies, MDA needs to go beyond individual villages, to encompass whole populations that have interlinked connections via school, work and other forms of engagement.</p>
              <p>The ivermectin and permethrin that we used for this study were from international suppliers and met appropriate international quality standards including Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The study team directly observed participants taking ivermectin. Therefore, it is unlikely that either the quality of the treatments or adherence had any impact on the study outcomes.</p>
              <p>There are a small number of health clinics that service the area of the study villages. We were unable to differentiate presentations by study arm as each clinic services multiple villages and aggregate consultation data at the clinic level. The small reduction in the proportion of scabies presentations in the 12 months after MDA in the clinics that service study villages compared to those that do not may further support the hypothesis that there was an initial decline in scabies prevalence following MDA, but it was undetectable at 21-months due to the unexpected population movement and the presumed re-introduction and transmission of scabies.</p>
              <p>While the timing of trial procedures was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, our procedures remained essentially intact. Beyond our control was the increased population movement which appears to have reduced the effectiveness of the ivermectin-based MDA strategy that has previously worked so well in Solomon Islands and other Pacific Island countries. Despite the challenges of this trial, recent results from a trial in Fiji indicate that single dose ivermectin is highly promising as a more practical means of delivering MDA [<xref rid="pntd.0011207.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite the exceptional circumstances faced by the RISE trial, our observations can serve to inform the design of scabies control programs and trials of MDA strategies.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Ms Lake,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "One versus two doses of ivermectin-based mass drug administration for the control of scabies: A cluster randomised non-inferiority trial" for consideration at PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic. Based on the reviews, we are likely to accept this manuscript for publication, providing that you modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations. </p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting this cluster-randomised non-inferiority trial of one versus two doses of ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) for the control of scabies in Solomon Islands. As a result of the ensuing Covid-19 pandemic, there was a deviation from protocol and a single endpoint assessment was made at 21 months. In contrast to previous studies of MDA with ivermectin, no reduction in prevalence of scabies was found in either study arm. A plausible explanation for this is that there was an influx of new people into the villages during the study period as a result of the pandemic, especially as a reduction in prevalence was found among those who had been present at the baseline assessment. In addition a reduction in the severity of scabies and in the prevalence of impetigo was identified.</p>
              <p>This paper is of interest to a wide readership as scabies is now a WHO-recognized neglected tropical disease and there is improved awareness of its significant disease burden globally, including its association with secondary bacterial infections and immune-mediated complications such as acute glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever. The study is also of interest to a wide readership as it highlights some of the challenges of instituting MDA treatment for scabies under "real world" conditions.</p>
              <p>Before the paper can be considered for publication, the authors should response to each of the Reviewers comments, especially Reviewer 1's comment that in both in the abstract and conclusions the authors should make the exceptional circumstances clearer together with lessons that can be learned. </p>
              <p>Additional minor comment: Line 362. needs rewording</p>
              <p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 30 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email. </p>
              <p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p>
              <p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to all review comments, and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript. </p>
              <p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out</p>
              <p>[2] Two versions of the revised manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p>
              <p>Important additional instructions are given below your reviewer comments. </p>
              <p>Thank you again for your submission to our journal. We hope that our editorial process has been constructive so far, and we welcome your feedback at any time. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.</p>

              <p>Thank you for submitting this cluster-randomised non-inferiority trial of one versus two doses of ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) for the control of scabies in Solomon Islands. As a result of the ensuing Covid-19 pandemic, there was a deviation from protocol and a single endpoint assessment was made at 21 months. In contrast to previous studies of MDA with ivermectin, no reduction in prevalence of scabies was found in either study arm. A plausible explanation for this is that there was an influx of new people into the villages during the study period as a result of the pandemic, especially as a reduction in prevalence was found among those who had been present at the baseline assessment. In addition a reduction in the severity of scabies and in the prevalence of impetigo was identified.</p>
              <p>This paper is of interest to a wide readership as scabies is now a WHO-recognized neglected tropical disease and there is improved awareness of its significant disease burden globally, including its association with secondary bacterial infections and immune-mediated complications such as acute glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever.

              <p>Before the paper can be considered for publication, the authors should response to each of the Reviewers comments, especially Reviewer 1's comment that in both in the abstract and conclusions the authors should make the exceptional circumstances clearer together with lessons that can be learned. </p>

              <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Methods</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
              <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
              <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
              <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
              <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The essential difficulty with this study – which was well planned and conducted - is that both arms of the ivermectin dosing ie one versus two doses failed to produce an effect and therefore cannot be compared. In the case of the two dose regimen, which is that used in previous studies the drug did not produce the anticipated effect in reduction of scabies levels. The study single dose produced similar effects. The authors argue that large movements of populations during the period of the study accounted for the difference. This seems a likely explanation although other possibilities should be considered such as failure of community compliance or a high level of local ivermectin resistance in the Sarcoptes population – both are unlikely. This leaves a problem in that the study failed to achieve its objective and the purpose of publishing is to record reasons for study failure. The study for understandable reasons also failed to follow the study protocol leaving a single evaluation point at 21 months. </p>
              <p>In writing up the study both in the abstract and conclusions the authors should make the exceptional circumstances clearer together with lessons that can be learned. Reintroduction of scabies into mainland treated communities by untreated patients has already been highlighted as a public health challenge. This study should have provided the opportunity to emphasise this. Otherwise it simply reads as a well conducted but failed experiment. Some rewording is required</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: It is regrettably unusual for researchers to submit so called "negative studies", I congratulate this team on putting this together and persevering inspite of the challenges the pandemic brought.</p>
              <p>The study design is clear as are the objectives, population etch. All ethical approval appears to have been sort from host and other countries.</p>
              <p>Local/host country researchers are included in the study (not as first or senior author).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This is a well-written paper with very clear objectives. Though scabies was the main focus disease for the study the opportunities to study impetigo using this same method which was also nested to simulate real population dynamics were undertaken. This brings the results close to the reality on the ground. </p>
              <p>This research paper is also premised on the fact that ivermectin is impactful in the mass treatment of scabies, and for this reason, the WHO has started a program to address scabies elimination. However, this paper set out to explore a more efficacious treatment regimen of twice-a-year treatment as against once-a-year treatment. This in my opinion is novel and opens up for further research, and additionally informs guidelines development for scabies elimination in the field of NTDs. </p>
              <p>The study justification is clear with clear objectives to guide the method. The study methodology is adequate and justifies the results obtained despite the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that led to changes in the timelines and study methodology by deferring the endpoint. Despite the changes made enrollment into the study received adequate sample sizes that produced the results obtained with clear, logical, and convincing discussions. The statistical analyses are simple, easy to follow and understand and yet adequate.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Results</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
              <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Please provide a reference for the case definition of impetigo used .</p>
              <p>Can you provide details of the permethrin treatment regimen followed ?</p>
              <p>Can you comment on the changes in impetigo data – do they provide any support for the view that population movements accounted for the unexpected results recorded.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The analysis presented deviates from the initial plan for reasons detailed in the methodology - the pandemic interupted the second phase of data collection so both post MDA data collections were amalagmated. This seems a reasonable work aroundl.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The analysis was changed to suit the altered methodology, but however, is very acceptable with clear results that were well presented very simple tables of sufficient quality and clarity.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Conclusions</bold>
              </p>
              <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
              <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
              <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p>
              <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: In other studies how significant has been failure to recall receipt of MDA treatment by patients as a factor in producing discordant results ?</p>
              <p>What lessons does this work this provide for future studies or strategies for scabies control teams ?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The conclusions are supported by the data presented. The limitations of the analysis clearly described.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Despite the disruption caused by covid-19 pandemic, the outcomes are valuable to inform further research and decision-making. The research did adhere to all ethical review processes and standards of operation in my opinion.</p>
              <p>The conclusions based on the results are still valuable in spite of the changes in methodology, and well presented in the light of the changing population dynamics having compromised the results but do open up further suitable research questions to be answered in other studies in similar settings and other geographies</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Page 13 line 264 - do you really need both table 2 and figure 3? I think there might be too many tables so suggest considering leaving out 2</p>
              <p>Page 16 line 300 you mention impetigo is reduced post MDA etc referencing table 2 - I think you mean table 3</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: I encountered very few typos requiring editorial work in the paper.</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This RISE studyhas dealt with the challenges the pandemic brought to the execution of the data collection in a constructive way. The work introduces the first experience of an MDA for scabies apparently having little impact on overall scabies levels in the community inlike previous MDA studies - although these were more isolated communities/isolated and did not have the returnees joining midway through sent from the big cities back to thier home villages - which has been effecively explained as an interpretation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The paper is well-written and does not require any significant changes except minimal editorial work as already indicated.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Lake,</p>
              <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'One versus two doses of ivermectin-based mass drug administration for the control of scabies: A cluster randomised non-inferiority trial' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
              <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
              <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
              <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
              <p>Michele Murdoch</p>

              <p>Dear Ms Lake,</p>
              <p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "One versus two doses of ivermectin-based mass drug administration for the control of scabies: A cluster randomised non-inferiority trial," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p>
              <p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial, Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p>
              <p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
