                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Construction workers are at elevated risk of suicide. MATES in Construction (MATES) is one of the few suicide prevention programs that explicitly address this problem. The MATES program includes an integrated system of services that supports prevention, early intervention and recovery (i.e., primary, secondary and tertiary prevention) for mental health problems among construction workers. In this protocol, we describe a proposed evaluation of <italic>MATESmobile</italic>, an electronic platform which will be accessed by workers who have undergone MATES training.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In this protocol, we describe a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) which seeks to assess whether <italic>MATESmobile</italic> results in improved literacy regarding suicide prevention, and improved help-seeking and help-offering attitudes among those who have attended MATES training. Secondary outcomes include changes in suicide ideation, suicide attempt and psychological distress. Workers will be recruited prior to MATES face-to-face training. In total, 295 workers will be randomly assigned to the intervention condition (<italic>MATESmobile</italic> + face-to-face training) and 295 will be randomly allocated to the control (face-to-face training). The intervention will run for 8 weeks. Assessments will be run immediately post intervention, and at 3, 6, and 12 months</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Elevated rates of suicide among construction workers have been identified in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], including Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such elevated rates among construction workers may reflect a range of factors connected to employment in a highly-male dominated workforce, including excessive alcohol consumption, relationship problems, and lack of help-seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Aside from this, workers in construction also face a number of adverse psychosocial working conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], including low job control and high psychological demands (the combination of which produces job strain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], low social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and work-family conflict (when role pressures from the work and family domains are mutually incompatible) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There are constant shifts in the landscape and organisation of construction work, as tasks, colleagues and supervisors change from project to project and job to job, contributing to feelings of job insecurity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Adding to this instability is the fact that many workers are forced to meet short deadlines and experience periods of unemployment between projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The lowest skilled groups may be at most risk, especially during times of economic recession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Mates in Construction (MATES) is a charity established in 2008 by the Building Employees Redundancy Trust to prevent suicide in the construction industry. MATES is an industry-based, multimodal workplace-focused charity, delivered at construction sites or company offices. Significant commitment from building site management to the program has been crucial — both to communicate organisational investment in addressing the issue of suicide, and also allow training to be completed during work hours. MATES is a multi-component prevention and early intervention program, consistent with the Australian National Suicide Prevention Strategy (‘Living Is For Everyone’ or ‘LIFE’) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MATES operates over four states and, to date, training has been delivered to over 135,000 workers. The core component of the MATES training is the General Awareness Training (GAT), a 45-min face-to-face awareness session provided to all construction workers on site. GAT promotes awareness of and risk factors for suicidality. It aims to reduce stigma and encourage help-seeking and help-offering behaviour, and presents suicide as preventable. “Help offering” refers to workers offering active support to co-workers who display any suicide warning signs. Workers completing GAT are provided with a white sticker to wear on their hard hat identifying them as ‘GAT-trained’. For a site to be designated ‘compliant’, all workers on that worksite must receive GAT, with an 80% training level maintained despite staff turnover. GAT is also a component of a training program specifically for apprentices. Other components of MATES that support GAT include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par7">“Connector training” for volunteer “gatekeepers”: Connectors help an at-risk worker access help via a trained worker, MATES Field Officer, Case Manager or other local community supports.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">Suicide First Aid: in which Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) trained workers provide suicide first aid interventions for at-risk workers identified by Connectors.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">Field Officers: Field Officers are employed directly by MATES. Their job is to increase awareness, recruit new construction sites, and provide ongoing support to MATES sites through fortnightly site visits, establishing and maintaining relationships with workers on-site, and debriefing Connectors.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Case managers: Suitably qualified case managers are employed to assist troubled workers with a plan to effectively address their issue(s). This could include connecting workers with such services as their EAP, financial counselling, drug and alcohol services, grief counselling, or family and relationship counselling.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par11">Thus, MATES provides an integrated health service model aimed at prevention, early intervention, and recovery (i.e., primary, secondary and tertiary prevention).</p>
              <p id="Par12">Since its inception, MATES has been committed to evaluation and continual program improvement. A recent evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] compared age-standardised suicide rates among the construction industry to other employed males. There was evidence of a decline in suicide rates among construction workers employed in the state of Queensland (where there has been a high uptake of MATES) compared to other employed males. In 2011, another evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] assessed process related outcomes, for example, how prepared participants felt to deal with someone who was suicidal, and attitudes towards suicide. Compared to 355 workers at two sites who had not completed GAT, those who received the training showed greater improvements in knowledge about suicide.</p>
              <p id="Par13">Several other uncontrolled evaluations have also suggested that MATES is an acceptable and appropriate intervention for workers in the construction industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The main limitations of these evaluations are that they only assessed knowledge immediately before and after training, and therefore could not provide information on whether MATES resulted in greater retention of knowledge in the long term. Thus, this finding may reflect transient “training effects” – where an individual retains knowledge immediately post training but loses it over time. Another problem is that these evaluations were conducted in one state only, and the findings may therefore not be generalisable to other states. Lastly, these evaluations did not assess the extent to which training reduced suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide among construction workers. Thus, several questions remain about the extent to which those who take part in the program experience individual changes in relevant outcomes proximal to suicide death, such as suicide ideation, self-harm or suicide attempt, and psychological distress. Further, and most specific to this project, questions remain about the longer-term impacts of the program, and whether it would achieve better outcomes if strengthened and reinforced by additional elements.</p>
              <p id="Par14">To fill the gaps in knowledge noted above, MATES has recently developed <italic>MATESmobile</italic>, an electronic platform which was designed to follow MATES face-to-face GAT training. <italic>MATESmobile</italic> seeks to enhance and sustain the effectiveness of MATES through a smartphone approach, which we will evaluate in relation to a wider range of outcomes than assessed previously. <italic>MATESmobile</italic> will focus on two main elements: 1) reinforcing face-to-face training messages over time, and; 2) enabling links to mental health support should people need it. The use of a smartphone approach to deliver this program is feasible and appropriate considering the high uptake of smart phones the construction industry, where they are considered a ‘tool of trade’.</p>
              <p id="Par15">In this paper, we describe the randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of <italic>MATESmobile.</italic> The evaluation seeks to evaluate the potential gains of complementing MATES face-to-face training with <italic>MATESmobile</italic>. <italic>MATESmobile</italic> will be implemented by MATES, with support from the research team named in this project.

                <p id="Par19">This ongoing contact will reinforce messages from MATES, aiming to increase knowledge and skills in suicide prevention literacy, as well as more helpful attitudes about the extent to which suicide is preventable. The reinforcement of messages will also flow through to impact help offering (e.g., the message “MATES help other MATES”) and also help-seeking from either formal (e.g., doctors, mental health professionals, case management) or informal sources (e.g., peer support from co-workers, friends and family). At the same time, the <italic>MATESmobile</italic> platform will provide informational resources for those in need or at risk of suicide, including how to access to case management and other health services. It also seeks to encourage social support and community around the MATES program, leading to improvements in psychosocial safety at work. Collectively, all these aspects of the program are hypothesized to lead to improvements in primary and secondary outcomes.</p>

Based on this, a minimum of 295 participants per group will be required to detect this difference at the nominal 0.05 significance level with 90% power. A previous study has shown that 13% of the working population report suicide ideation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We believe it is realistic to expect a change from 13 to 8% prevalence following the trial. Power calculations indicate we will need 267 persons per group to detect this difference at the nominal 0.05 significance level with 90% power. Assuming 30% drop-out, we therefore aimed to recruit a total of 844 participants over a three-month period.</p>

This approach can also accommodate and assess the strength and significance of clustering effects, enabling us to model cohort effects (including training time and location) using random effects within the MMRM models. For binary outcomes (prevalence of suicidal ideation) and skewed outcomes (severity of suicidal thoughts and behaviours), a comparable modelling approach will be used that accounts for binary and ordinal outcomes. Process evaluation will be analysed using descriptive statistics; for example, the average amount of time spent using the app during each session will be assessed.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par41">Suicide among construction workers continues to be unacceptably high in Australia, as in many areas of the world. MATES is one of the few workplace suicide prevention programs attempting to tackle the high burden of suicide in this occupational group. Importantly, it is among the few workplace suicide prevention program for which there is any evidence of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, there are still much to be learned about MATES, including whether training effects persist over time, and whether the program has effects on proximal risk factors for suicide, such as suicide ideation, suicide attempts and psychological distress. We hope that the <italic>MATESmobile</italic> trial will begin to fill some of these gaps in current knowledge, and provide evidence for the effectiveness of a new, highly accessible smartphone app that can be rapidly disseminated throughout the construction industry.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Online and electronic interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing stigmatising attitudes towards depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], enhancing knowledge about evidence-based treatment, promoting help-seeking from family and friends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and improving knowledge about symptoms of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, their effectiveness in enhancing knowledge about suicide prevention, suicide ideation, and self-harm is mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Researchers acknowledge that online interventions are most effective when supported by strategies that: allow users to tailor activities to their context; reduce attrition; and promote ongoing use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This presents a clear rationale for an approach that makes use of both online and face-to-face mechanisms (i.e. a blended approach). In this study, we will assess the potential gains that can be made by supplementing a multi-level workplace suicide prevention program with smartphone technology, which will allow MATES to keep in contact with participants over time and as they move from site to site.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Aside from testing the effectiveness of <italic>MATESmobile</italic>, the Project offers the opportunity for considerable capacity-building between health service provider MATES, and the Partner Organisations who are supporting the project; all of whom view <italic>MATESmobile</italic> as a platform for extending their activities to other aspects of workplace health and wellbeing. <italic>MATESmobile</italic> has a multitude of potential future applications and uses, including being a way of connecting and supporting men and women in the construction industry long term, and thereby creating a community of advocates for suicide prevention.</p>
