                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability globally and its costs exceed those of cancer and diabetes combined. Recent evidence suggests that individualised cognitive and movement rehabilitation combined with lifestyle advice (cognitive functional therapy (CFT)) may produce larger and more sustained effects than traditional approaches, and movement sensor biofeedback may enhance outcomes. Therefore, this three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare the clinical effectiveness and economic efficiency of individualised CFT delivered with or without movement sensor biofeedback, with usual care for patients with chronic, disabling LBP.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Pragmatic, three-arm, randomised, parallel group, superiority RCT comparing usual care (n=164) with CFT (n=164) and CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback (n=164). Inclusion criteria include: adults with a current episode of LBP &gt;3 months; sought primary care ≥6 weeks ago for this episode of LBP; average LBP intensity of ≥4 (0–10 scale); at least moderate pain-related interference with work or daily activities. The CFT-only and CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback participants will receive seven treatment sessions over 12 weeks plus a ‘booster’ session at 26 weeks. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 13, 26, 40 and 52 weeks. The primary outcome is pain-related physical activity limitation (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire). Linear mixed models will be used to assess the effect of treatment on physical activity limitation across all time points, with the primary comparison being a formal test of adjusted mean differences between groups at 13 weeks. For the economic (cost-utility) analysis, the primary outcome of clinical effect will be quality-adjusted life years measured across the 12-month follow-up using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Globally, low back pain (LBP) carries the greatest burden of disease in terms of years lived with disability.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Most people with an episode of LBP improve rapidly; however, many have recurrent pain and some develop chronic LBP (pain lasting &gt;3 months) with high levels of disability.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This group of patients is responsible for most of the cost and burden associated with LBP.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The resultant societal costs of chronic LBP are enormous, exceeding that of cancer and diabetes combined,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> with the majority of these costs being due to loss of work participation and ongoing care-seeking. Current care models are failing, with LBP-related disability increasing 45% from 1990 to 2010.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>LBP guidelines recommend that patients seeking care for LBP are initially offered simple interventions (eg, advice and self-management strategies) and, if they do not improve quickly, then other interventions such as anti-inflammatory medication, exercise therapy and manual therapies.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> For those patients who fail to respond to these interventions, care is often rapidly escalated, to more invasive, expensive and potentially harmful interventions, including opioids,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> injections<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and surgery,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which have limited evidence of effectiveness despite carrying substantial risks. Furthermore, these patients frequently undergo expensive imaging, which does not improve outcomes and may actually be detrimental.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There is an urgent need for effective ‘second line’ primary care interventions for those patients who do not improve with early standard management to reduce chronicity and limit the number of people progressing to secondary care.</p>
              <p>Exercise approaches are the most widely recommended interventions for patients with chronic disabling LBP.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A number of exercise approaches, including graded activity, pilates and motor control exercises, have been shown to produce small to moderate effects but with a variable duration of improvements.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref> One aspect this has been attributed to is a lack of individualised management of known psychological barriers to recovery and inadequate targeting of exercise to each individual’s specific functional movement limitations.</p>
              <p>Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) was developed as a physiotherapist-led, individualised cognitive and behavioural self-management approach to chronic disabling LBP that helps people to: (1) reconceptualise their pain from a biopsychosocial perspective, while dispelling unhelpful beliefs and identifying new cognitive and behavioural responses to pain; (2) build confidence to engage in functional activities related to their goals through functional movement training and (3) adopt a healthy lifestyle by targeting activity avoidance, poor sleep habits, stress management and dietary advice.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A Norwegian study of patients with chronic LBP (N=121) found CFT resulted in large sustained effect sizes (12-month standardised effect sizes from 0.7 to 0.9) compared with guideline-recommended manual therapy and exercise.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These findings suggest a large, high-quality study is now required.</p>
              <p>With advances in technology, movement sensors enable accurate measurement and monitoring of lumbar spine movements outside the research laboratory.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Wearable movement sensors enable clinicians to precisely measure movement patterns, postures (functional movements) and their relationship to pain, both in the clinical setting but more importantly, during patients’ normal activities (work, rest and play) outside the clinic. In addition, movement sensors could help patients to develop an awareness of how they move and the postures they use during normal activities, where changes to these habituated functional movement behaviours are most important. This technology has the potential to increase the effectiveness of therapies aimed at correcting functional movement behaviours. A recent pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT; N=112) of patients with chronic LBP showed that individualised rehabilitation, based on addressing functional movement behaviours, combined with biofeedback from wearing wireless movement sensors, resulted in large and sustained clinical improvements compared with guideline-recommended treatment (12-month effect sizes from 0.5 to 1.0).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>Therefore, this three-arm RCT aims to compare the clinical effectiveness and economic efficiency of individualised CFT, delivered with or without movement sensor biofeedback, with usual care for patients with chronic, disabling LBP.</p>

              <title>Methods and analysis</title>
              <p>The RESTORE study is a pragmatic, three-arm, parallel group, superiority RCT comparing usual care with CFT only and CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback in patients with chronic LBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The trial will be conducted in Perth and Sydney, Australia. Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study (HRE2018-0062, 6 February 2018). The protocol follows the guidelines described in the ‘Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials’ Statement.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>

                <p>Trial participants will be recruited via clinicians (eg, general medical practitioners, physiotherapists, pain clinics, surgeons) or directly from the community (eg, via print media and social media). Clinicians will conduct a preliminary screening of patients with LBP and inform potential trial participants about the study. Those patients who request further information about the study will be provided with a flyer, which directs them to the study website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.restorebackpain.com/">https://www.restorebackpain.com/</ext-link>) where greater study detail, including the participant information sheet and consent form, are provided. Potential participants can opt to have the research team contact them or can simply take the study flyer and contact the research team directly.</p>
                <p>Participants will also be recruited directly from the community, without a health practitioner referral. Information about the trial will be disseminated via social media (including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) and print media (including flyers and newsletters) which will direct to the website and the research team.</p>
                <p>All potential participants will be screened for eligibility over the phone by a researcher prior to inclusion. The researcher will also note in the trial database any reasons for excluding a referred patient but not any identifying details of that person. Recruitment into RESTORE commenced on 23 October 2018.</p>

                <title>Consent process</title>
                <p>Consent will be sought from potential participants who meet the inclusion criteria. A researcher will discuss the trial protocol and offer participants the opportunity to provide consent electronically or by mail (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 1</xref>). Electronic consent for the trial will be via a weblink to an electronic version of the consent form. The consent form also asks patients to indicate whether they are comfortable or not with videos being taken of some treatment sessions. Videos are used to monitor fidelity of the physiotherapist in delivering the individualised rehabilitation as per the study protocol. Participants can withdraw for any reason at any time.</p>

                  <p>Both CFT treatment groups will have the same treatment frequency of seven treatment sessions over 12 weeks plus a ‘booster’ session at 26 weeks (initial consultation 60 min, follow ups 30–40 min) in physiotherapy clinics. In both groups, clinicians will use a structured approach to address the relevant cognitive, emotional and behavioural (functional and lifestyle) factors deemed relevant to the individual’s presentation.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
                  <p>Based on prior screening (Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire and the Patient-Specific Functional Scale) combined with a comprehensive interview and functional examination, the clinician will identify the multidimensional contributors to pain, distress and disability. This will enable the physiotherapist to design a management plan that is tailored to the person’s unique clinical presentation and context.</p>
                  <p>There are three broad components to the intervention:</p>
                  <p>Making sense of pain: a reflective process that combines the person’s own narrative (interview) and experience (during guided behavioural experiments) to develop a personally relevant, multidimensional understanding of pain for the patient. In this process, unhelpful beliefs and responses to pain are disconfirmed, and new helpful cognitive and behavioural responses (functional and lifestyle) to pain are identified that are linked to their personally relevant goals.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
                  <p>Exposure with ‘control’: a process of behavioural change through experiential learning following a ‘graded exposure’ model, designed to challenge expectations of pain and damage consequences via guided behavioural experiments. Specifically, sympathetic nervous system responses (rapid upper chest breathing and body tension) and safety-seeking behaviours (protective muscle guarding, breath holding, movement avoidance and propping of the hand) that manifest during exposure to painful, feared or avoided functional tasks are explicitly targeted and controlled. This provides patients with strategies to relax, control respiration, normalise postural and movement behaviours that they nominate as painful, feared or avoided. The new strategies are immediately integrated into goal-orientated daily activities to build self-efficacy and body conditioning.</p>
                  <p>Lifestyle change: behavioural modification addressing unhelpful lifestyle factors aimed at increasing physical activity levels based on preference, sleep habits, regulation of stress (via relaxation techniques) and/or dietary advice, where relevant.</p>
                  <p>CFT is underpinned by a strong therapeutic alliance and motivational interviewing style (open, non-judgmental, reflective)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> providing validation and facilitating disclosure.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> An individualised progressive self-management programme will be provided, monitored and progressed that includes cognitive restructuring, progressive functional exercises and lifestyle changes, tailored to the individual’s goals.</p>
                  <p>All participants in the CFT-only and CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback groups will wear the movement sensors for the same duration and frequency, but for the CFT-only group, the movement sensors will be a placebo, meaning that the sensors will collect data, but neither the patient nor the clinician will have access to it (only the researchers have access). The ViMove2 device (DorsaVi P/L, Melbourne, Australia) consists of miniaturised sensors attached to the lumbar spine with hypoallergenic tape and communicate wirelessly with a tablet or mobile phone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). At all treatment sessions, patients in both CFT groups will perform forward bending in standing and two other clinically relevant functional movements selected by the physiotherapist based in the patient specific functional scale. All three movements will be repeated three times and data recorded via the movement sensors.</p>

                  <p>Clinicians in this group will treat patients with the same CFT approach as in the CFT-only group except that in addition, these clinicians will have access to data measured by the movement sensors and be able to use these data for assessment, movement retraining and providing biofeedback. The identification of clinically relevant functional movement behaviours in this particular treatment group will also be informed by data from the movement sensors that are graphically analysed and displayed by the ViMove2 software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>).</p>

                  <p>This additional information could assist in guiding individualised movement retraining incorporating the following strategies. First, ‘live assessment’ can assist in identifying unusual kinematic parameters or movement patterns.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Second, ‘live training’ in the clinic, allows visual interaction by observing real-time kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) on-screen data to facilitate changing functional movement behaviours. Third, using the ViMove2 software, clinicians can programme movement sensor biofeedback alerts (audio ‘beeps’ and messages via a trial-supplied iPhone) that will reinforce key principles from the treatment session while the participant goes about their normal daily activities for the rest of the day. The device will prompt the patient when they ‘break a movement rule’ that has been programmed for them by the clinician. Individualised movement ‘prompts’ may be time based, such as reducing long periods of sitting without getting up and moving, or may be kinematically based, such as reducing sitting in an excessively upright position.</p>

                <title>Clinician recruitment and training</title>
                <p>Depending on recruitment and training success, approximately 16 physiotherapists (8 in each city) will deliver the interventions at private physiotherapy clinics. Each physiotherapist will deliver only one CFT treatment arm to prevent learning (contamination) from experience using the movement sensor output being applied to the CFT-only patients. Physiotherapists will be randomised into either the CFT-only group or CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback group. Up to four additional physiotherapists will be recruited and trained in each city to act as reserves if required. For physiotherapists to be considered for inclusion in the training programme, they will need to have: at least 2 years clinical experience postgraduation; experience treating people with chronic LBP; an interest in applying biopsychosocial management principles via CFT; a willingness to use movement sensors clinically; less than 4 days of prior exposure to CFT training and a willingness to be observed and videoed for mentoring and feedback purposes while treating a non-trial patient with disabling LBP.</p>
                <p>The clinician training for both the CFT-only group and CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback group will consist of three components: (1) clinical workshops including live patient demonstrations and mentoring of the physiotherapists while treating patients, (2) online resources (eg, e-book and training videos) and (3) Facebook private support group pages.</p>

                  <title>CFT training</title>
                  <p>Six clinical workshops will be conducted (a 2-day workshop every month for 6 months) in each city where both CFT-only and CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback groups will train together. A final single day workshop will be held for each group separately when clinicians will need to demonstrate a predefined level of competency, as evaluated by the CFT and movement sensor clinical trainers using a structured competency checklist before being eligible to deliver the relevant intervention in the trial. The training workshops will include an initial introductory workshop about CFT with patient involvement, a workshop to build skills regarding communication and behavioural experiments and four workshops involving observation of each physiotherapist examining and treating people with disabling LBP using CFT. The later four sessions will be observed by the clinical trainers who will provide personalised feedback using a competency checklist developed for the training. The CFT training will be conducted by physiotherapists (POS and JPC) who developed the CFT approach and have extensive experience using and teaching CFT. Clinical competency will be assessed in a final 1-day workshop or by ongoing videos of patients if required.</p>

                  <title>Movement sensor training</title>
                  <p>Because the ViMove2 movement sensors are worn by participants in both CFT groups, all participating clinicians will attend a 2-hour technical workshop on setting up and using the ViMove2 devices. This workshop will focus on sensor placement, how to test they are working and how to troubleshoot technical issues. The training will occur after the sixth training workshop and at least 2 weeks before the final single-day workshop. The clinicians in the CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback group will attend a second 4-hour workshop on accessing and interpreting the movement data (kinematic and EMG) and programming biofeedback. These movement sensor workshops will be conducted by a physiotherapist (RL) with extensive experience using these movement sensors clinically and teaching clinicians in their use. Personalised mentoring by RL will be available over the phone to each physiotherapist for up to five post hoc reviews of treatment sessions of trial participants.</p>

This process is recommended in the Spillane <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> framework for implementation fidelity in trials.

Based on our pilot study results,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 20</xref> we hypothesise that the CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback group would have an average score of 7.5 points on the RMDQ and the usual care group would have a score of 11.5 points. Pragmatically and arbitrarily, we assume the CFT-only group will have a mean outcome that is halfway (9.5) between the other two groups and so we will power the trial to detect this as the smallest likely between-group difference (11.5–9.5=2.0).</p>
