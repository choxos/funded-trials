                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>People with spinal cord injuries in low-income and middle-income countries are highly vulnerable to life-threatening complications in the period immediately after discharge from hospital. We are conducting a randomised controlled trial in Bangladesh to determine whether all-cause mortality at 2 years can be reduced if health professionals regularly ring and visit participants in their homes following discharge. We will conduct a process evaluation alongside the trial to explain the trial results and determine the feasibility of scaling this intervention up in low-income and middle-income countries if it is found to be effective.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Our process evaluation is based on the Realist and Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance frameworks. We will use a mixed methods approach that uses both qualitative and quantitative data. For example, we will audit a sample of telephone interactions between intervention participants and the healthcare professionals, and we will conduct semistructured interviews with people reflective of various interest groups. Quantitative data will also be collected to determine the number and length of interactions between the healthcare professionals and participants, the types of issues identified during each interaction and the nature of the support and advice provided by the healthcare professionals. All quantitative and qualitative data will be analysed iteratively before the final analysis of the trial results. These data will then be triangulated with the final results of the primary outcome.</p>

The study will be conducted in compliance with all stipulations of its protocol, the conditions of ethics committee approval and the relevant regulatory bodies. The results of the trial will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presentations at scientific conferences.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There are no accurate data on the incidence of spinal cord injuries (SCI) in low-income countries such as Bangladesh but most working in the area believe that it could be as high as 70 per million.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> That is, three to four times that of high-income countries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Similarly, there are few accurate data about survival following SCI in these countries.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> However, our own estimates from one specialised service in Bangladesh indicate that 19% of people with SCI who are wheelchair-dependent and survive until discharge, die within 2 years.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Most are young males dying from complications such as sepsis due to pressure ulcers.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref> There is therefore a pressing need to find sustainable ways of supporting people with SCI in the community following discharge, particularly those at high risk of complications.</p>
              <p>The Community-based InterVentions to prevent serIous Complications following spinal cord injury in Bangladesh (CIVIC) trial was designed to test the effectiveness of an inexpensive and sustainable model of community-based care that could be rolled out in Bangladesh and other low-income countries to support people with SCI following discharge. The model of care was developed over a number of years and over the course of a preliminary pilot study.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It involves assigning healthcare professionals for 2 years to people with SCI as they are discharged from hospital. The healthcare professionals act like case managers and are in regular telephone contact with participants, and responsible for monitoring for complications, providing advice and support, and being a familiar point of contact for participants and their families. The assigned healthcare professionals also visit participants in their homes and provide participants with a small amount of financial assistance ($AU80). The healthcare professionals are thus responsible for proactively supporting participants and their families on discharge and providing them with regular support and advice, as well as monitoring for early signs of complications.</p>
              <p>The primary outcome of CIVIC trial is all-cause mortality at 2 years. Recruitment to the study commenced in July 2015 and finished in March 2018 with the final follow-up assessment due in March 2020. The process evaluation described in this paper will help explain the results of the trial and determine the feasibility of scaling up this intervention in Bangladesh and other low-income and middle-income countries if it is found to be effective.</p>

                <title>Summary of CIVIC trial</title>
                <p>An investigator-initiated pragmatic randomised controlled trial is being undertaken. The trial was prospectively registered with the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and the trial protocol has been published.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In brief, 410 people with recent SCI who are wheelchair dependent and about to be discharged home from the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed in Bangladesh are randomised to either an intervention or control group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Participants in the intervention group receive our model of community-based care for2 years in which they are assigned a healthcare professional who rings them every 2 weeks in the first year and every month in the second year, and visits them in their homes on three occasions over the 2 years. At each point of contact, the healthcare professional screens participants for early signs of complications, and provides them and their families with advice and support. In contrast, participants in the control group receive the care that is currently provided by the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed. That is, at discharge participants are encouraged to ring the hospital if they develop any problems, and some are rung or visited on one occasion by hospital staff as part of the hospital’s limited follow-up service.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at 2 years determined by blinded assessors interviewing next of kin (Bangladesh does not have a death registry). There are also a number of secondary outcomes including complications, depression, independence, quality of life and ability to participate in community activities.</p>
                <p>The trial is powered to have a 80% probability of detecting an increase in survival from 83%<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> to 93% at 2 years with a two-sided log-rank test, uniform follow-up time of 2 years, loss to follow-up in both groups of 15% at 2 years and an alpha of 0.05. A trial-based economic evaluation will be conducted based on differences observed between groups in costs, overall survival and quality-adjusted survival at 2 years. This will enable an estimate of an incremental cost per quality adjusted life year of the intervention over standard care.</p>

                <p>Our process evaluation is based on the Realist<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> frameworks. The Realist framework is a social science method of examining the relationships between the context, mechanisms and outcomes of trials involving complex interventions to better explain the possible causal pathways through which the different components of the intervention might work. It includes consideration of whom the intervention is most likely to work for and within what context along with consideration of which aspects of the intervention are most important and for what reasons. Consideration and exploration of these factors is believed to ultimately increase the uptake of research results into clinical practice.</p>
                <p>The RE-AIM framework<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) uses qualitative and quantitative data to develop the intervention, and to then evaluate and disseminate trial findings. It covers five domains according to its acronym, namely: the <italic>reach</italic> of the intervention which can in part be examined by looking at those included and excluded from the trial, the <italic>effectiveness</italic> of the intervention which is reflected in the trial outcomes, the likely <italic>adoption</italic> of the intervention which can be determined by looking at how representative the site and country is of other settings, the <italic>implementation</italic> of the intervention as part of the trial which includes aspects of trial fidelity and cost containment and the <italic>maintenance</italic> of the intervention after the trial ceases. Not all aspects of the RE-AIM framework are relevant to this process evaluation but are being broadly used to guide the trial and process evaluation.</p>

Only participants who are currently in the trial at the time of data collection will be sampled. The selection of the telephone interactions will be made prior to recording and selected to ensure maximal representation of the different types of participants including: those living in rural locations versus living in urban locations; those with paraplegia versus tetraplegia; and those with minimal problems since discharge versus multiple problems since discharge. The telephone interactions will be in Bangla and will be recorded and then translated ad verbatim into English.</p>

                <p>At the time of protocol development, usual care was minimal. Most patients were discharged home with no formal follow-up from the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed although sometimes patients were rung or visited on one occasion. If the results of the trial are negative then it will be important to explore whether this level of care increased since the commencement of the trial leading to contamination, and if so, whether control participants were receiving more contact from hospital staff as part of usual care than intervention participants. We will do this by tallying the number of times control and intervention participants had contact with non-trial staff from the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed over the course of the study. These data are being collected as part of the 2-year assessments. Participants are asked how many times they have had contact with trial staff from the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed in the preceding 2 years since discharge.

These staff ring approximately 30 patients per month from a list of patients discharged over the last 30 years. Staff do not know which patients are part of the trial and whether those involved are control or intervention participants.

                <p>The interviews will be conducted by the first author (SH). He lives in Bangladesh, is fluent in Bangla and English, is a principal investigator and has worked at the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed for over 15 years (initially as a clinical physiotherapist and then as the head of medical services). All interviews will be conducted and recorded in Bangla, and then translated ad verbatim into English (unless the healthcare professional and participant are fluent in English). The interviews will follow an interview guide which outlines broad topics to be discussed. The topics address the various purposes of the process evaluation (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix 1</xref> for types of questions that will be asked). The interviews will be conducted on a one-to-one basis and are expected to take 1–2 hours each.</p>

                <p>Purposeful sampling will be used to select 20 participants and 14 healthcare professionals. The participants will not be the same as those used to capture the telephone interactions. Instead, they will be a mix of control and intervention participants who are either currently on the trial or have recently completed the trial, and will be selected to ensure best possible representation from a combination of the various interest groups including: living in a rural location versus living in an urban location, paraplegia versus tetraplegia, minimal problems since discharge versus multiple problems since discharge. The 14 healthcare professionals will include four staff members working on CIVIC trial who are either responsible for delivering the intervention or overall management of the trial. The remaining 10 healthcare professionals will be people not directly involved in CIVIC trial but with extensive experience or understanding of the management of people with SCI in Bangladesh. It will include people working at the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed and working in rehabilitation in the community; and people who are in daily contact with people with SCI as well as those in managerial roles likely to have insight into the barriers and facilitators of scaling the intervention up in the future.</p>

                <p>People with SCI in Bangladesh were not directly involved in prioritising the research question underpinning CIVIC trial, although it is perhaps reasonable to assume that an intervention which aims to reduce mortality would be considered a priority for this group of people. As part of the process evaluation, participants in the intervention group will be asked about their experiences and perceptions of the intervention, and in particular whether they found the regular contact with healthcare professionals burdensome. We will ensure that participants of the trial are informed about the results. We will achieve this by sending them a one-page summary of the main findings in Bangla on completion of the trial.</p>

                <p>CIVIC trial will provide unbiased and precise estimates of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an inexpensive and sustainable model of community-based care for people with SCI in Bangladesh. Evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will have widespread implications for provision of health services for people with SCI and other conditions that cause serious disability in low-income and middle-income countries.</p>
                <p>Process evaluations conducted alongside trials involving complex interventions such as that provided in CIVIC are widely advocated because the causal links between the different components of the intervention and outcomes of the trial are not always clear. The intervention provided as part of CIVIC is a complex community-based rehabilitation intervention that is based on similar services provided in high-income countries and studies which have advocated the benefits of telephone-based support for people with SCI.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> The intervention is complex because it involves repeated interactions between healthcare professionals and intervention participants over a 2-year period as well as the provision of a small amount of financial support. Details about the intervention have been described in our trial protocol according to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Importantly, attention has been directed at ensuring the intervention is delivered as intended. For this reason, trial staff are regularly trained and provided with standard forms and screening logs which are completed each time they have contact with an intervention participant. However, it is not possible nor is it desirable to ensure that all interactions between trial staff and intervention participants are exactly the same. The trial is pragmatic and hence trial staff are expected to individualise their interactions with intervention participants according to their many diverse needs. The nature of each interaction will also depend on the personalities of both the trial staff and the intervention participants. Some interactions may be largely social and the trial staff may not obviously provide any advice or support. However, regular contact with a concerned and supportive healthcare professional may be important for people who otherwise have very little contact with healthcare professionals and may be socially isolated. The skills of staff may also differ in keeping with the pragmatic nature of the trial and reflecting the realities of how this intervention would be provided in the future, if successful. Some staff may be very skilled at providing advice and support while others may not be as skilled. It is important to explore the nature of the interactions to better understand how the skill of staff may or may not influence outcomes and how the intervention may or may not work. As such, our process evaluation will look at some of these key contextual factors that both contribute to and hinder the potential benefit of the intervention and that are important for understanding different aspects of the intervention.</p>
                <p>The intervention includes the allocation of a small amount of money for each participant to spend on services and goods such as dressings for pressure ulcers, catheters for bladder management, mattresses for beds and transport for medical attention. It will be important to determine how this money was spent as part of the process evaluation and whether it was considered an essential and important aspect of the intervention. These data will also provide insight into the economic implications of living with SCI in a country like Bangladesh and the role poverty plays in complications, mortality, depression and quality of life. Answers to these questions will help us better understand whether financial assistance is an essential aspect of the intervention and needs to be included when scaling up the intervention.</p>
                <p>An important barrier to scaling the intervention up in the future if it is found to be effective will be cost. While a formal economic analysis from the healthcare provider perspective will be performed as part of the trial, the results of this process evaluation will also provide insight into economic barriers to scaling up of the intervention. So, interviews with healthcare professionals involved in management will explore their perspectives on the financial constraints and implications of rolling out the intervention. We will combine this information with the results of the formal economic analysis to make recommendations on the overall financial implications of scaling up the intervention across Bangladesh and other low-income and middle-income countries. We have done similar for a trial designed to determine the effectiveness of family-led rehabilitation following stroke in India (ATTEND trial).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> The process evaluation that formed part of the ATTEND trial has guided the process evaluation for CIVIC trial.</p>
                <p>In all, our process evaluation will be an important aspect of CIVIC trial. It will explore facilitators and barriers to rolling this intervention out in the future if it is found to be effective. Regardless of CIVIC trial results, our process evaluation will help guide future research in this much-neglected area.</p>
