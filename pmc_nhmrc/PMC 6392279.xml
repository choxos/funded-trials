              <abstract>
                <p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that resistance training has been ineffective for improving walking outcomes in adults with neurological conditions. However, evidence suggests that previous studies have not aligned resistance exercise prescription to muscle function when walking. The main aim of this study was to determine whether a training seminar for clinicians could improve knowledge of gait and align resistance exercise prescription to the biomechanics of gait and muscle function for walking. A training seminar was conducted at 12 rehabilitation facilities with 178 clinicians. Current practice, knowledge and barriers to exercise were assessed by observation and questionnaire prior to and immediately after the seminar, and at three-month follow-up. Additionally, post-seminar support and mentoring was randomly provided to half of the rehabilitation facilities using a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The seminar led to significant improvements in clinician knowledge of the biomechanics of gait and resistance training, the amount of ballistic (<italic>t</italic> = -2.38; <italic>p</italic> = .04) and conventional (<italic>t</italic> = -2.30; <italic>p</italic> = .04) resistance training being prescribed. However, ongoing post-seminar support and mentoring was not associated with any additional benefits <italic>F</italic>(1, 9) = .05, <italic>p</italic> = .83, partial eta squared = .01. Further, improved exercise prescription occurred in the absence of any change to perceived barriers. The training seminar led to significant improvements in the time spent in ballistic and conventional resistance training. There was no further benefit obtained from the additional post-seminar support. The seminar led to improved knowledge and significantly greater time spent prescribing task-specific resistance exercises.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The primary cause of reduced ability to walk for many people with neurological conditions is muscle weakness [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212168.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the field of stroke rehabilitation, where evidence is most advanced, clinical guidelines state a ‘strong’ recommendation for resistance training for the lower limb to improve walking [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212168.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, despite the strong recommendation, the guidelines state ‘the optimal strengthening protocol is not known’ [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite a large body of evidence that muscle weakness is the primary impairment causing walking limitations, and guidelines recommending resistance training during rehabilitation, systematic reviews demonstrate that resistance training has little impact on walking outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212168.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Further, observational studies have identified that clinicians are devoting a reasonable proportion of time to resistance training during rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but the exercises prescribed may not necessarily be specific to the goal of walking [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Task-specific resistance training is a term used to describe exercises specifically prescribed to replicate muscle performance for function, with the expectation that resistance gains will more likely lead to improved function, in this case walking. With respect to walking, a key aspect of task-specific resistance training is the speed at which exercises are performed. The main lower-limb joints move quickly at high angular velocities during walking [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], indicating that resistance exercises should be performed ballistically [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ballistic, or fast, resistance exercises are prescribed to improve power generation [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ‘Power’ is a term that describes how quickly force is generated during a movement or exercise, and is important for walking when the joints are required to move quickly [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is possible that significant improvements in leg resistance have not translated to greater walking outcomes because the resistance exercises prescribed have not been specific to training the muscles responsible for power production during walking [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], guidelines for specificity of resistance training are not commonly followed [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and resistance exercises have been prescribed at slow speeds [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>The limited impact of guideline adherence on mobility outcomes may relate to the guidelines themselves. The AGREE II statement is a 23-item tool that outlines guideline development, reporting and evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It states what is required of a guideline for clinical implementation. In the case of the Stroke Foundation guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the recommendation for resistance training programs, especially for the lower extremity, is not supported by any further tools or advice on how to implement resistance training. This means that clinicians who do follow clinical guidelines are not provided with instructions or strategies for how to perform resistance training, which exercises they should be performing, how they should be progressed or how often they should be performed.</p>
              <p>The biomechanics of, and muscle function for, walking are well established [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is possible that the knowledge of biomechanics of gait and muscle function during walking, coupled with the application of resistance training guidelines in people with lower limb muscle weakness have not been readily applied in adult neurological rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To improve mobility outcomes for adults with neurological conditions, a range of therapist-related implementation factors may need to be considered [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. If clinicians are devoting a reasonable proportion of time to resistance training during rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], then education regarding the application of task-specific resistance exercises may be sufficient to improve patient outcomes. However, implementing change in clinician behaviour, or in this case resistance exercise prescription, is complex and multi-factorial [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and there is wide-spread agreement amongst researchers that education alone is not usually sufficient to lead to change in clinical practice.</p>
              <p>There are a number of task-specific criteria outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine which are important to consider when prescribing resistance exercises. They relate to factors such as appropriate targeting, duration, and load etc [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the overall aim of this project was to determine the effectiveness of a seminar (including education, demonstration and practical application) on improving the proportion of ballistic resistance exercise prescription for treating muscle weakness in people with neurological conditions who were receiving therapy to improve their ability to walk. Specifically, the four main aims were to;</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This project was approved by the Human Research and Ethics Committee of The University of Melbourne (Ethics ID: 1647064). The individuals pictured in the video summary of the training seminar provided written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to publish their image alongside the manuscript. A training seminar was developed to improve the knowledge and exercise prescription of clinicians working with people with neurological conditions who had leg weakness and walking limitations. The training seminar was piloted at four rehabilitation facilities prior to the commencement of this project. Feedback was incorporated into the final version of the program, and delivered by the primary author.</p>
              <p>The seminar was conducted at 12 separate rehabilitation facilities comprising 3.5 hours of education, training, practical demonstration and modelling, and participant practice. The education content included information regarding current guidelines for muscle weakness in neurological conditions, the evidence contributing to the development of these guidelines, the evidence for resistance training in adult neurological rehabilitation, the biomechanics of walking, muscle function for walking, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for task-specific (ballistic) resistance training [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], case presentations, modelling and demonstration of exercise prescription, and clinician practice of exercise application. The seminar utilised a lecture format, practical demonstration and clinician practice. A video recording of the training seminar is available by contacting the lead author. All clinicians (physiotherapists and exercise physiologists) at each rehabilitation facility were approached prior to the seminar and provided with written plain language statements. Those who agreed to participate in this project provided written informed consent. Attendance was free and voluntary. Signed informed consent forms were collected separately from the questionnaires to ensure anonymity.</p>
              <p>Questionnaires and direct observation at three timepoints were used to collect outcome data. Timepoint 1 was prior to the seminar, Timepoint 2 was immediately following the seminar and Timepoint 3 was three months after the seminar. Questionnaires were completed at all three timepoints. The questionnaires were used to collect participant demographic data and to evaluate 1) baseline knowledge (Timepoint 1); 2) knowledge gained during the seminar (Timepoint 2); and 3) how knowledge was retained (Timepoint 3). Bespoke questionnaires were designed by the authors given the novel nature of this study, and pilot tested on six clinicians working in neurological rehabilitation. Feedback from the clinicians, in relation to clarity, wording and meaning, was incorporated into the final versions provided to the clinicians who participated in this study. The direct observation sessions occurred at Timepoints 1 and 3 to evaluate change in exercise prescription. Each observation session was conducted over one full working day.</p>
              <p>Since the need for additional implementation and behaviour change strategies and support after the seminar was unclear, the rehabilitation facilities were randomised to either receive additional mentoring and support or none. A matched cluster design was piloted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212168.g001">Fig 1</xref>) to determine whether ongoing support and mentoring after the seminar was associated with higher levels of change in exercise prescription (Aim 4). Twelve rehabilitation facilities were identified, from a list of 14, and consented to participate in the observational stage of this project, representing the public and private sectors, and metropolitan and rural areas. The four public, four private and four rural rehabilitation facilities were each selected as they employed the largest number of therapists in their respective sector. Two facilities were not approached to participate due to resistance training trials that were concurrently being conducted. The four rehabilitation facilities within each cluster were randomised by an independent biostatistician, using consecutively-numbered opaque envelopes. Each rehabilitation facility was classified as public or private, and metropolitan or rural, matched and then randomly assigned to receive ongoing support and mentoring, or no support. The design of the matched cluster RCT conformed to the Consort 2010 statement: extension to cluster randomised trials [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, as this was a pilot project, the trial was not registered.</p>

                <p>Half of the rehabilitation facilities were matched cluster randomised to receive ongoing mentoring and support for three months. The ongoing support was provided by the lead investigator. The lead investigator liaised with a locally nominated ‘change champion’ at the rehabilitation facility weekly for the first four weeks, and then fortnightly after that. Strategies were provided to address potential barriers identified in the pilot study, in previous rehabilitation studies, and any further barriers identified by the local change champion. Identification of barriers to change in professional behaviours is important as targeting strategies may be effective if barriers have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The potential barriers identified were grouped into six domains which included 1) leadership, 2) variations in staffing, 3) patient safety, 4) therapist beliefs about resistance training, 5) therapist confidence, motivation and engagement, and 6) resources (time and equipment). The specific strategies employed to facilitate uptake were;</p>

                <p><xref rid="pone.0212168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that there were 68 patients with neurologically related gait disorders observed across the 12 sites initially, and a further 81 patients observed three months later. The greater number of patients observed during the second session was unintended, and simply reflects that more patients with mobility limitations attended on those particular days. Overall, there were only 30.5 minutes of ballistic exercise initially performed by the 68 patients from a total 2188 minutes (1.4%) spent exercising. Three months later, 122 minutes (4 times greater) of ballistic exercise was performed by the 81 patients during 3288 minutes (3.7%) spent exercising. Compared to ballistic resistance training, a greater amount of conventional resistance training was initially performed, totalling 200 minutes (9.1%). Time spent performing conventional resistance training also increased at follow-up to 340 minutes (10.3%). At each rehabilitation facility, the average time spent performing ballistic exercise per site was only 2.5 (±5.4) min initially. The amount of time spent performing ballistic exercise increased significantly to 10.2 (±9.7) min at follow up (<italic>t</italic> = -2.38; <italic>p</italic> = .04). The eta squared statistic (0.08) indicates a moderate effect size [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Average time spent engaged in conventional exercise also increased significantly from 16.7 (±14.4) min initially to 28.3 (±22.7) min at follow-up (<italic>t</italic> = -2.30; <italic>p</italic> = .04).

                <p>When comparing the perceived barriers to implementing ballistic resistance training after the seminar and at three-month follow-up, there was little change. The same three barriers were most commonly reported by therapists (<xref rid="pone.0212168.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). They were 1) their perception of the patients’ capacity to engage in ballistic resistance training, 2) the therapists’ confidence and capacity to provide ballistic resistance training to patients and 3) access to equipment. Although the barriers did not change, therapists did engage in more ballistic and resistance training, and reported they were more confident to do so.</p>

              <p>The training seminar led to significant improvements in the time spent in ballistic and conventional resistance training. Further, improved exercise prescription occurred in the absence of any change to perceived barriers. However, there was no additional benefit associated with ongoing mentoring and support.</p>
              <p>The results indicate that the primary barrier to therapists prescribing more ballistic resistance exercises was knowledge. As knowledge improved, so too did the amount of ballistic and conventional resistance training prescribed. Although the improvements in task-specific resistance training were significant, they were obtained from a low baseline, and were small in magnitude. This finding is consistent with a recent Cochrane review that reported tailored implementation can be effective but effects tend to be small to moderate [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Large improvements in clinician knowledge were obtained, demonstrated by the number of clinicians responding correctly (<xref rid="pone.0212168.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Improved exercise prescription occurring in the absence of any change to perceived barriers may be due to the inclusion of strategies for implementation, clinical examples, clinician practical application, and discussion of approaches to address potential barriers and utilize facilitators to exercise prescription. The inclusion of these additional tailored strategies, generated from the earlier pilot study, to the traditional lecture style format of post-graduate education may also be the reason why significant increases in ballistic exercise prescription were observed [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Reasons for the finding of no additional benefit associated with the ongoing mentoring and support may be that the seminar content was sufficient for this initial stage of implementation [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Alternatively, ongoing support may be required over a longer time period than that measured in this study to embed changes in work practices [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Improvements in the provision of ballistic resistance training were also obtained even though the barriers reported by therapists were unchanged. Prior to, and following the seminar the three mostly commonly reported barriers were beliefs about patient capacity to perform ballistic exercises, therapist confidence in delivering them, and access to appropriate equipment. Three months is a short period of time to change therapist confidence and their beliefs about patient capacity to engage in new exercises, when nearly half of the clinicians had more than five years of experience. Although confidence was a commonly reported barrier initially, it had improved by three-month follow-up, and was also one of the most commonly reported enablers. This indicates that therapists are in the early stages of behaviour change, as they begin to implement new exercises but are yet to establish a skill for a novel application [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>A greater proportion of therapist time was spent performing conventional rather than ballistic resistance training before and after the seminar. This finding is in line with ACSM guidelines which suggest that a base of resistance training is required prior to ballistic resistance training [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ballistic resistance training is novel to neurological rehabilitation, with few studies reporting its application in people with neurological conditions [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212168.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Consequently, clinicians may remain cautious with regard to its application. Nevertheless, the ballistic application of exercise prescription was highlighted in this seminar due to the task-specificity of resistance training required to improve walking and was effective at linking established knowledge bases and facilitating some clinicians to implement these novel ballistic resistance exercises. Clinicians reported greater knowledge of the principles of resistance training, biomechanics of walking and muscle function, and increased their patients time spent performing resistance exercises including ballistic exercises. Not all lower-limb resistance and mobility related goals, such as sit to stand or transfers, require such fast or ballistic contractions. Overall, the significantly greater time spent performing ballistic and conventional resistance training indicates a greater appreciation of muscle weakness as the physical impairment for many people with neurologically related walking limitations.</p>
              <sec id="sec015">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The significant increase in ballistic resistance training is encouraging, but that does not necessarily indicate that all the ballistic exercises prescribed were task-specific. Speed of muscle contraction is only one aspect of task specificity. For a resistance exercise to be task specific, other factors such as type of contraction, segmental alignment, and load need to be considered [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and evidence at this stage suggests task specificity of resistance exercises in neurological rehabilitation is poor [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The impact of task-specific lower limb leg resistance on walking outcomes is yet to be reported.</p>
                <p>The seminars led to a significant increase in total time spent engaged in ballistic and conventional resistance training, and improved therapist knowledge and confidence, but care must be taken in interpreting these results. There was an increase in the number of people observed at Timepoint 2, and therefore the total number of minutes spend exercising, which may have influenced the results. However, in relation to resistance training, the proportion of time spent on ballistic and conventional resistance exercise increased at Timepoint 2. Further, it is unknown whether the patients benefitted. It is possible that the response options in the post-seminar questionnaire may have biased results towards more positive answers as several of the questions were not neutrally formatted (for example ‘Do you have a better understanding’). The questions were specifically worded this way to determine whether participants perceived that the training seminar had an effect on their knowledge, and although the questions are not neutrally formatted, the response categories were. Further research needs to determine whether the application of task-specific ballistic resistance training for walking is more effective than conventional resistance training. If task-specific ballistic resistance training is more effective than current resistance training practices, then the Stroke Foundation (and other) guidelines can be further developed [<xref rid="pone.0212168.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and include advice and tools for clinical implementation.</p>
                <p>The improved rates of conventional and ballistic resistance training three-months following the seminar may be due to an observer or Hawthorne effect. Clinicians were unaware of the purpose of the initial observation sessions, other than a general quantification of the types of exercises routinely performed in physiotherapy. However, at three-month follow-up, clinicians would have had a greater awareness of the purpose of the observation session. We are unable to determine whether the amount of time spent performing ballistic resistance training during the observation sessions is an accurate reflection of usual practice, or partly due to an observer effect.</p>
                <p>Finally, although post-seminar support was provided to half of the rehabilitation facilities, this support was not prescribed, controlled or measured. We took this pragmatic approach so that each site’s change champion was able to tailor the ongoing support to their facility’s needs. We found no difference in the amount of ballistic exercise prescribed between the sites randomised to receive post-seminar support, and those who received none, but we are unable to determine whether greater amounts of post-seminar support, or types of support, were associated with greater ballistic resistance training prescription at each site.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The seminar led to improved knowledge and significantly greater time spent prescribing ballistic and conventional resistance training. Whilst significant, these improvements were small and achieved from a low baseline. There was no further benefit obtained at the sites randomised to receive additional post-seminar support. However, the seminar did include strategies for implementation, and addressed potential barriers and facilitators to exercise prescription.</p>
