                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Skin is important in Australian Aboriginal culture informing kinship and identity. In many remote Aboriginal communities, scabies and impetigo are very common. Untreated skin infections are painful, itchy and frequently go untreated due to under-recognition and lack of awareness of their potential serious complications. We hypothesise that the skin infection burden in remote Aboriginal communities can be reduced by implementing streamlined training and treatment pathways integrated with environmental health and health promotion activities, tested in the See, Treat, Prevent (SToP skin sores and scabies) trial.</p>

                  <p>SToP will evaluate a skin control programme using a stepped-wedge, cluster randomised trial design with three intervention components (the â€˜SToP activitiesâ€™): (1) seeing skin infections (development of training resources implemented within a community dermatology model); (2) treating skin infections (employing the latest evidence for impetigo, and scabies treatment); and (3) preventing skin infections (embedded, culturally informed health promotion and environmental health activities). Four community clusters in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia will participate. Following baseline data collection, two clusters will be randomly allocated to the SToP activities. At 12 months, the remaining two clusters will transition to the SToP activities. The primary outcome is the diagnosis of impetigo in children (5â€“9 years) at school-based surveillance. Secondary outcome measures include scabies diagnosis, other child health indicators, resistance to cotrimoxazole in circulating pathogenic bacteria, determining the economic burden of skin disease and evaluating the cost effectiveness of SToP activities.</p>

              <p>Skin is important in Aboriginal culture as it is central to identity, determines kinship, connection to country and creates belonging.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Maintaining healthy skin is important for maintaining overall physical and cultural health and well-being. However, environmental, social and demographic factors place Australian Aboriginal people living in remote communities at risk of skin infections including impetigo,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> scabies<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and crusted scabies,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> and their sequelae. These skin infections have a high burden and contribute to sustaining the health disparities experienced by Australian Aboriginal people.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Australian Aboriginal children living in remote communities have the highest burden of impetigo in the world, with a median prevalence of 45% (IQR 34%â€“49%), surpassing Africa (7% (IQR 4%â€“12%)), Asia (7% (IQR 3%â€“16%)) and Oceania (30% (IQR 15%â€“42%)).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Scabies has a similarly high burden, with the prevalence reported at 5%â€“35% in remote Australian contexts.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8</xref> Australian Aboriginal children have the third highest global prevalence of infestation by scabies, behind only Panama and Fiji (at 78% and 44% children infested, respectively).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Skin infections are not benign. Untreated skin infections may lead to group A streptococcal (GAS)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> and staphylococcal sepsis,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> skeletal infection,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13â€“16</xref> and postinfectious complications of GAS, which include chronic kidney disease<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> and potentially rheumatic heart disease (RHD).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> GAS-related kidney disease and RHD occur in Australian Aboriginal people at among the highest rates in the world.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Skin infections are potentially the most remediable cause of serious disease in remote living Australian Aboriginal people.</p>
              <p>In remote Western Australian communities, skin infections are the second most common cause for primary care presentations<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and account for approximately 1% of all hospitalisations in childhood, with 15% of Aboriginal infants admitted to hospital with a skin infection before their first birthday.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Aboriginal children are almost 15 times more likely to be hospitalised with skin infections than their non-Aboriginal peers and Aboriginal children living in the Kimberley region suffer from the highest hospitalisation rate for skin infections in Western Australia.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite the burden and serious consequences, skin infections have become â€˜normalisedâ€™ and frequently go untreated due to under-recognition, lack of awareness of their importance and inadequate knowledge of evidence-based, effective treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 23</xref> Comprehensive and sustainable skin disease control in remote Aboriginal contexts is urgently needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a combination of improved training, provision of evidence-based treatment in a treatment as prevention framework, environmental health and health promotion activities will result in a sustained reduction in skin infection in remote Western Australian Aboriginal communities.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>The See, Treat, Prevent (SToP skin sores and scabies) trial is a pragmatic, cluster randomised trial involving four community clusters with an open-cohort stepped-wedge design.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24â€“26</xref> The clusters receive the intervention at different timepoints. The order in which the clusters start the intervention is randomised and data are collected from the clusters over time. During a lead-in period (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, shaded whiteâ€”visits 1 and 2), baseline skin infection data will be collected from school-based surveillance study visits. The school-based surveillance will be augmented with routinely available clinic data from electronic records, hospital records and baseline skin health Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice surveys collected as part of a process evaluation of the trial (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary file 1</xref>). At the start of visit 3, the SToP interventions (â€˜SToP activitiesâ€™) will commence in two of the clusters. The remaining two clusters will transition to the interventions 12 months later (at visit 6). By the end of the trial, all four clusters will be receiving the SToP activities. The final school-based surveillance measurement will be completed at visit 9, and maintenance activities will commence (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>â€”shaded yellow). Maintenance activities will be an enhanced business as usual approach, where we expect that the communities will continue to use the SToP trial resources and processes but without further education and input from the trial team. During the 12-month maintenance period (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>â€”year 4), routinely available clinic/hospital data will continue to be collected to investigate the longer term impact of the intervention in the absence of regular school-based surveillance and to evaluate the intervention effectiveness on indicators of chronic disease. No data will be collected at timepoints 4 nor 8 because the communities are inaccessible at that time of year (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>The four clusters in this trial are single remote Australian Aboriginal communities, or groups of communities in close proximity, within distinct geographical areas in the Kimberley region of far north Western Australia. The populations range from approximately 450 people in the smallest discrete community to approximately 1000 in the largest clusters. The distance from the communities to the nearest major regional town ranges from 200 to 1200â€‰km. The Kimberley region is one of the most remote and sparsely populated in Australia, with an estimated population of approximately 35â€‰000 people, 47% of whom are Aboriginal, spread over 421â€‰000 km<sup>2</sup>.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Service and Western Australian Country Health Services (Kimberley) administer the community clinics, staffed by remote area nurses, general practitioner and Aboriginal health practitioners. The planned trial period is between April 2019 and December 2021 with the intervention planned for delivery between September 2019 and September 2021. Maintenance will commence in October 2021 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) and continue to December 2022.</p>

                <p>Trial participants will be recruited from four community clusters. All members of the participating communities may be exposed to the SToP activities. Community clusters were chosen based on the following pragmatic criteria: a population of approximately 1000 people, access to a health clinic staffed full time by nurses, practical accessibility for research staff and with advice from local Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal health and environmental health service leaders from the Kimberley Aboriginal Health Planning Forum. The Kimberley Aboriginal Health Planning Forum is a state government endorsed committee that meets monthly to discuss strategic priorities for delivery of healthcare for Aboriginal people throughout the Kimberley region. With advice from the Chief Investigator on the criteria for community clusters, the leaders of the Kimberley Aboriginal Health Planning Forum recommended the most appropriate communities for inclusion, prior to contact with community elders. During the 12-month period of community engagement that preceded ethics submissions, consultation with leaders of the Kimberley Aboriginal Health Planning Forum and community elders in the nine communities confirmed the appropriateness of these selections. Communities were excluded if community leaders declined to participate.</p>

                <title>Definitions</title>
                <p>Impetigo (commonly referred to as â€˜skin soresâ€™ or â€˜school soresâ€™) is the result of a bacterial infection usually caused by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus and/or</italic> GAS.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Clinically, impetigo typically presents as three subclassifications that generally follow the progression from initial infection as the sore healsâ€”(1) â€˜purulentâ€™ where the sores start as round/oval pus-filled bumps that may progress into blisters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>); (2) â€˜crustedâ€™ where the sore produces a clear honey-coloured fluid that forms a crust on the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>); (3) â€˜flat/dryâ€™ when the crust resolves and the healing skin beneath the preceding crust may initially be pink and flat as the sore heals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). Early on, the flat dry sores may have resolving peeling of the edges. Later, this becomes a rounded, flat scarâ€”evidence of preceding impetigo. Scabies is an infection of the skin as a result of an infestation by the mite <italic>Sarcoptes scabiei</italic> var. <italic>hominis</italic>.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It results in small papules (1â€“2â€‰mm) that are intensely itchy. Scratching due to scabies can break the skin barrier resulting in secondary bacterial infection. Crusted scabies is a severe form of scabies (hyperinfestation) where the personâ€™s immune system cannot control the infestation and the mites rapidly multiply. The skin reacts to the infestation by crusting and shedding.</p>

                  <p>School-based surveillance activities hold a dual purpose for this study: measurement of the primary outcome, and completion of skin identification training activities as per the community dermatology model (see the Training section). School-aged children have a high burden of disease and are an established cohort for surveillance purposes. School-based surveillance for all children (3â€“15 years old), and early childhood centres where feasible (for children &lt;5 years of age), will occur in all four community clusters to establish baseline prevalence data for impetigo and scabies (study visits 1â€“2, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). School (and early childhood centres) surveillance will continue in all four community clusters during study visits 3â€“9 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), irrespective of intervention or control status of the community. During surveillance, impetigo, scabies and crusted scabies will be assessed via a visual diagnosis for each participant; impetigo meeting the definitions of purulent, crusted or flat/dry features, scabies being the presence of papules, burrows and itch, and infected scabies defined as itch, papules/burrows with secondary evidence of crust or purulence. Suspected crusted scabies will be assessed in conjunction with local clinic health professionals as recommended by current local clinical guidelines. Surveillance data will be augmented with data from clinic presentations for skin infections to develop dashboard reporting of skin infections for each community cluster. Deidentified clinic level data on the number of school referrals received and type of treatment administered/dispensed will also be collected from the electronic clinical record.</p>

                  <p>Health promotion and environmental health activities will supplement the well-established activities led by the research partner organisations, Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services, Western Australia Country Health Services (Kimberley) and the Nirrumbuk Environmental Health and Services. All prevention research activities will be integrated with usual service delivery and enhanced where possible to improve the delivery of health promotion and environmental health activities at the time of the study surveillance visits.</p>
                  <p>Commencing during the consultation phase and continuing through the trial, community participatory action research<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> will be used to engage community members and service providers in defining the format (including online, social media, posters, flipcharts, mobile phone messaging, music videos, public service announcements) and content of health promotion materials. The messages will focus on the importance of seeking healthcare for skin infections as well as appropriate prevention strategies (including good skin hygiene, insect bite prevention, care of minor trauma and maintenance of skin integrity).<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In addition, a music video that aims to improve community awareness of the importance of environmental health on skin and overall health will be produced during step 1 for ongoing health promotion.</p>
                  <p>Other environmental health activities aim to strengthen the relationships between clinic and environmental health services. Wherever possible, environmental health service staff will complete training and surveillance activities in partnership with the study team. Children identified with skin infections during surveillance will receive two referrals: one to the clinic for treatment and one to environmental health services for a home assessment.</p>

This will evaluate whether implementation was delivered as intended and provide insights into the practice changes necessary to translate this trial more broadly (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary file 1</xref>). A prespecified evaluation and monitoring framework was developed for the SToP trial using programme theory<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary file 1</xref>). These measures will determine whether any outcomes arise as a result of the SToP activities and what intervention elements contributed to its success or failure. The monitoring and evaluation framework developed for the trial will collect evaluative data using mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) concurrently with the trial outcome measures, and where possible, use existing sources of data and/or be paired with other study data collection procedures.</p>
                <p>Quantitative evaluation data sources include case report forms from school surveillance, regional level data from the electronic health records, cluster-level environmental health service records, trial records and laboratory testing of skin swabs. Qualitative data will be derived from project officer reports, semistructured interviews, staff reflection logs, and Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice surveys. For qualitative analysis, codes will be developed de novo from the data without prespecified questions or assumptions.

These methods use both the within-cluster and between-cluster information to estimate the treatment effect. The reduction in prevalence will be estimated as a weighted average of the treatment effect calculated across all communities. Community-level effects will also be reported. The model will include the presence/absence of impetigo as the dependent variable, fixed effects for time since start of study, transition to intervention (indicator variable) and, if appropriate, interactions between community and time, and between community and intervention. The analysis will include random effects for clusters and repeat measures of individuals. Using this model, it will be possible to investigate whether the intervention effect and secular trends are common across communities. In the event of convergence issues, we will adopt analogous methods such as generalised estimating equations (GEE) that have fewer assumptions compared with GLMMs or Bayesian hierarchical models with sensible priors on variance components.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> However, GEEs provide only population-level inference and, as per a GLMM, will require small-sample correction.</p>
                <p>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise the secondary outcomes and the economic evaluation will be conducted from the health system perspective. Cost-effective analysis of adopting the SToP trial activities in an ongoing programme will be compared with the status quo. The inclusion of activities carried out by environmental health teams will depend on their uptake and ability of the statistical analysis to separate their effects from the other SToP activities. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of all variables will be used in the cost-effective analysis.</p>

              <p>Healthy skin is a shared priority between Aboriginal community members and researchers in this research trial. The SToP trial has been designed to facilitate better skin and overall health for children and their families. There are many obstacles to achieving this goal, including underdiagnosis and underdetection (normalisation),<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> population mobility,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> high burden,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> effective but poorly tolerated treatment,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 51</xref> lack of sustained community engagement,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> high workforce turnover,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> high acute healthcare needs and ongoing social determinants of health. The combination of these factors and the legacy of colonisation have left the Australian Aboriginal community with intergenerational trauma,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54 55</xref> a high burden of chronic disease and a myriad of competing priorities.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Despite these challenges, the SToP trial is taking a comprehensive and strengths-based approach<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> to overcome the combination of these many obstacles through health promotion, improved access to the best available treatments and engaging health professionals in a better understanding of the importance of healthy skin.</p>
              <p>Skin infections in remote Aboriginal communities have been well described and have remained relatively static over more than two decades.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Several skin infection control programme have been trialled in remote communities, both in Australia<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5 51 57</xref> and internationally.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 58</xref> Regrettably, the initial benefits of these interventions in remote communities have not been sustained over the longer term, likely due to the need for an external workforce driving the change.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>
</p>
              <p>The SToP trial design extends previous research programme<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> that demonstrated the importance of sustainability, respect, beneficence and partnership as key priorities. In this large, comprehensive trial, considerable investment has been made, consistent with Australian government guidelines concerning the ethical conduct of Indigenous research,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> in developing the partnerships necessary to ensure the study resources and outcomes can be translated beyond the life of the trial. Using the latest evidence-based treatments in a â€˜treatment as preventionâ€™ framework, the SToP trial will be supported by the development of enhanced training materials and improved knowledge of activities to maintain healthy skin. The community engagement and consultation process of the SToP trial began more than 2â€‰years prior to the start of the trial in an iterative way to inform cluster selection and study design, particularly the prevention activities. Building trust between the research team and the communities involved is critical to success of studies like this, particularly through partnering with primary healthcare providers and remote Aboriginal communities.</p>
              <p>The cluster randomised trial with stepped-wedge design was chosen to limit research burden and improve research feasibility, while allowing for rapid translation of findings into clinical care. Due to the high risk that untreated skin infection poses for this population, this trial design provides the most ethical approach, with no participating community cluster missing out on the potential benefits of the SToP activities, while also allowing robust statistical methods (randomisation to intervention timing and hierarchical modelling) to be applied and maximising efficiency (project staff can provide support for each community cluster as they transition to the intervention phase). We have designed this trial with sustainability and transferability in mind so that the SToP activities can be delivered within existing healthcare structures that will require few additional resources. If successful, results of this trial could be rapidly translated to other communities throughout the region, as well as remote Aboriginal communities in other parts of Australia.</p>
              <p>The evidence base to inform the treatment as prevention strategies has been developed over the last decade by several of the lead authors. Specifically, cotrimoxazole has been shown to be non-inferior to intramuscular benzathine benzyl penicillin for impetigo with fewer side effects<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>; ivermectin mass drug administration was more effective than either permethrin mass administration or standard of care,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and the work of the non-profit organisation One Disease has advanced our understanding of crusted scabies.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We recently released the first edition of the National Healthy Skin Guideline for Aboriginal Australians<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> in May 2018. The guideline will aid in diagnosis and streamline treatment decisions for patients throughout in Australia. The results of this trial will inform subsequent editions of the National Healthy Skin Guideline, environmental health activities and their impact on human health and other primordial prevention strategies where current evidence is limited.</p>
              <p>The limitations of the SToP trial include the inability to assign a specific intervention to a specific outcome due to the complex, multimodal activities rolled out concurrently throughout the course of the study. The SToP trial may also be limited by small number of clusters and fewer visits than planned due to community inaccessibility during the long, northern Australian wet season (Novemberâ€“April) when several communities will not be accessible by road. There is potential for cross over with implementation of study interventions, and within clusters prior to commencement. Population mobility is high in this region, such that infection transmission may be increased along with permeability of the interventions between clusters. We are unable to measure population mobility formally and as such this is a limitation that may impact on trial outcomes. Finally, the high turnover of clinical staff reported in remote communities<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> will make the ongoing education plans challenging for the study to sustain.</p>
