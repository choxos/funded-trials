                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">In an attempt to improve children’s physical activity levels governments have introduced policies specifying the minimum time schools are to schedule physical activity each week. Despite this, the majority of schools in many jurisdictions fail to implement these policies. This study will assess the effectiveness of a multi-component implementation strategy on increasing the minutes of planned physical activity scheduled by primary school teachers each week.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 62 primary schools in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Schools will be randomly allocated to receive either a multi-component implementation strategy that includes; obtaining executive support, training in-school champions, provision of tools and resources, implementation prompts, reminders and feedback; or usual practice. The study will employ an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, assessing both policy implementation and individual (student) behavioural outcomes. The primary trial outcome of mean minutes of physical activity scheduled by classroom teachers across the school week will be measured via teacher log-book at baseline and approximately 12 and 18 months post baseline. A nested evaluation of the impact of policy implementation on child physical activity will be undertaken of students in Grades 2 and 3. Analyses will be performed using an intention to treat framework. Linear mixed effects regression models will be used to assess intervention effects on the primary outcome at both follow-up periods.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study will be the one of the first well powered randomised trials internationally to examine the impact of an implementation strategy for a physical activity policy in primary schools and will address a fundamental research translation gap. Given the dearth of research, the findings will be important in informing future implementation efforts in this setting.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par11">Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and is estimated to be responsible for approximately 6–10% of all non-communicable deaths or 5·7 million deaths globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. International physical activity guidelines recommend that children aged 5–17 years accumulate at least 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, data from the United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (U.K.) and Australia suggest only a third of primary school aged children meet these guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As child physical activity patterns track into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], ensuring children are sufficiently physically active has been identified as a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Schools are a key setting for the promotion of physical activity in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] as they provide convenient access to the majority of young people and possess the necessary facilities, personnel and ethos to engage children in activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore systematic reviews have found that interventions that increase opportunities to be physically active during the school day through regular quality physical education (PE), sport or physical activity in the classroom are effective in increasing children’s MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, reviews of school sport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and other structured activities in class such as energisers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have been shown to provide students with potentially 30mins of activity per day. As such, many governments have released guidelines or policy mandating minimum accumulated periods each week that primary schools are to schedule structured activity for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Despite the benefits of implementing such policies, research suggests that internationally most schools fail to implement physical activity policies at scale. For example, the 2014 physical activity report card for Ireland found that, based upon an audit of timetabled weekly PE of 419 schools, only 17% were providing the compulsory 2 h of PE per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similarly, a 2011 U.S. study that undertook observations of 154 PE lessons found that only 5% of schools were compliant with mandated state policies that require 100 min of PE be taught each week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A 2011 study found that only 43% of Canadian primary school teachers reported implementing the mandatory daily 30-min physical activity policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore a 2013 study, using 64 independent observers placed within Australian primary school classes for 9 weeks found only 13% of classes routinely engaged in physical activity during class time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">A recently published systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] of 17 qualitative and quantitative studies identified that primary schools face a number of barriers to the implementation of planned physical activities which relate to ‘environmental context and resources’ (e.g., availability of equipment, time or staff), ‘goals’ (e.g., the perceived priority of the policy in the school), ‘social influences’ (e.g., support from school boards), and ‘skills’ (e.g., teachers’ ability to implement the policy). Without the provision of implementation support to schools to overcome these barriers, the potential benefits of school-based physical activity policies on children’s health will not be realised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, there is little evidence regarding the most effective strategies to overcome these barriers and enhance implementation of physical activity policies in schools. A recent Cochrane review of the impact of implementation interventions in schools identified only one controlled trial in primary schools of a strategy to support the implementation of school physical activity policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The randomised trial undertaken in seven U.S. schools in 1994 aimed to enhance the quantity and quality of PE lessons by comparing the training of classroom teachers (whom received on-site training, intensive on-going technical assistance, modelling, audit and feedback, resources and coalition building support) to specialist PE teachers to control to improve teaching practices in PE lessons. Based on observational data of PE lessons, the study reported a significant improvement in implementation compared to control during the 3-year intervention period, however this was not sustained once the intensive support was removed.</p>
              <p id="Par15">The lack of evidence of effective strategies and their relative cost to support the implementation of physical activity policies represents a significant impediment to translation. Therefore, the primary aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component implementation strategy in increasing the minutes of planned weekly physical activity scheduled by classroom teachers consistent with the New South Wales (NSW) Government School Sport and Physical Activity Policy. As a secondary outcome of the trial, the study will assess the effectiveness of scheduled physical activity on children’s activity levels.</p>

                <title>Context</title>
                <p id="Par17">In 2015 the NSW Department of Education (DoE) amended its Sport and Physical Activity Policy (here after “policy”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], requiring students from Kindergarten to Year 10 to participate in a minimum of 150 min (increased from 120 min) of planned moderate with some vigorous physical activity across the school week. Planned physical activity includes time spent in PE, sport and other structured activities that is inclusive of all children and is part of their regular programming and planning. To support primary school teachers meet the policy requirements, the research team will target increases in planned physical activity across the three areas identified by the policy, that is; i) <bold><italic>PE-</italic></bold> teachers will be supported to programme PE throughout the school week by developing a scope and sequence for each school stage (K-2; 3–4; 5–6) and deliver active, effective and enjoyable PE. ii) <bold><italic>Sport-</italic></bold> teachers will be supported to programme sufficient time for sport and maximise student activity via strategies to improve student participation and enjoyment. iii) <bold><italic>Other structured activities-</italic></bold> teachers will be supported to integrate short-bouts of activity into class routines e.g. energisers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or active lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Energisers are short classroom-based physical activities that break-up sitting time by getting students to engage in short bursts i.e. 3–5 min of MVPA involving no equipment. Active lessons integrate physical activity into another subject area by making the traditional lesson more active, for example, getting students to skip as they recite their times tables.</p>

                <p id="Par18">This study will employ a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Sixty-two primary schools, in the Hunter New England (HNE) region, of NSW will be randomised to receive either a multi-component implementation strategy to support policy implementation or ‘usual practice’. The trial will assess between-group differences in the mean minutes of scheduled weekly physical activity with data collected at baseline (Oct 2017- Feb 2018), and immediately following the delivery of the implementation strategy (Oct-Dec 2018). To determine the longer-term sustainability data will be collected approximately 6-months following completion of the implementation strategy (April–June 2019) (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Time schedule of participant enrolment, data collection and intervention delivery</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2019_6492_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

An information package will be sent to parents of students in participating schools encouraging them to discuss the study procedures with their child and to invite study participation. Two weeks following distribution of the information packages, parents who have not returned a consent form will be telephoned by staff employed through the school and asked if they would like to consent to child participation.</p>

Allocation will follow baseline data collection. Due to the nature of the intervention school staff will be aware of school group allocation.

Following extensive formative research which included i) literature reviews; ii) interviews using an adapted form of the validated TDF survey with 76 primary school teachers and iii) observations of teachers’ delivery of PE, sport and the school environment, the recommended process described by Michie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] was undertaken to map the identified barriers to the BCW and TDF. Potential behaviour change techniques and implementation strategies were then identified. Following consultation with an advisory group consisting of, implementation and health behaviour scientists, physical activity experts, teachers, principals and senior government policy makers (who will oversee delivery of the study) the proposed implementation strategies were presented and discussed.

Accelerometers have displayed acceptable intra-and inter-instrumental reliability and provide a valid and reliable estimate of physical activity in young people.32–34 Accelerometers will be attached to a watch band and students will be asked by trained research assistants to wear the accelerometers on their non-dominant hand from Monday through to Friday, during school hours only (i.e. 9 am-3 pm). Accelerometers will be worn by children as soon as they enter their class for the day and removed when the bell for finishing school rings. Teachers will be responsible for distributing and collecting the accelerometers on a daily basis. Students will be asked to wear the accelerometers for the whole school day except for water-based activities. Student data will be analysed if accelerometers are worn for ≥80% of the school day on ≥3 days. Accelerometer non-wear time will be calculated by summing the number of consecutive zero counts accumulated in strings ≥20 min. Wear time will be estimated by subtracting non-wear time from the total monitoring time for the school day. For each valid school day, counts per minute (cpm) will be calculated by dividing the total accelerometer counts by the minutes of wear time. Accelerometer counts will be classified as sedentary, light-intensity PA, and MVPA using the vertical axis wrist cut-points developed by Chandler et al.

              <p id="Par48">Australian physical activity guidelines recommend children accumulate at least 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, similar to other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], statistics indicate only 1 in 4 (23%) of Australian primary school children meet the recommended level of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Improvements in scheduled physical activity in schools has the potential to increase child physical activity and hence should be embedded into a schools culture to maximise public health benefits.</p>
              <p id="Par49">This protocol comprehensively outlines the methodology to be undertaken to assess the effectiveness of a multi-component implementation support strategy to improve the implementation of the NSW Sport and Physical Activity Policy of 150 min of scheduled physical activity during a school week. Given the limited evidence base the trial will provide rigorous and theory informed methods to generate new knowledge regarding implementation of evidence-based policies and guidelines in schools.</p>
