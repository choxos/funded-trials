                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There is increasing demand for colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance, but healthcare capacity is limited. The burden on colonoscopy resources could be reduced by personalizing surveillance frequency using the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). This study will determine the safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient acceptance of using FIT to extend surveillance colonoscopy intervals for individuals at elevated risk of CRC.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial will invite participants who are scheduled for surveillance colonoscopy (due to a personal history of adenomas or a family history of CRC) and who have returned a low fecal hemoglobin (&lt;â2Â Î¼g Hb/g feces; F-Hb) using a two-sample FIT (OC Sensor, Eiken Chemical Company) in the prior 3Â years. A total of 1344 individuals will be randomized to either surveillance colonoscopy as scheduled or delayed by 1 or 2Â years for individuals originally recommended a 3- or 5-year surveillance interval, respectively. The primary endpoint is incidence of advanced neoplasia (advanced adenoma and/or CRC). Secondary endpoints include cost-effectiveness and consumer acceptability of extending surveillance intervals, determined using surveys and discrete choice experiments.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This study will establish the safety, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of utilizing a low FIT Hb result to extend colonoscopy surveillance intervals in a cohort at elevated risk for CRC. This personalized approach to CRC surveillance will lead to a reduction in unnecessary colonoscopies, increases in healthcare savings, and a better patient experience.Â </p>

              <p id="Par5">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common non-cutaneous solid cancer worldwide accounting for 1.9 million newly diagnosed cases in 2020 and is the second leading cause of cancer related death, with almost 1 million deaths reported in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These numbers are only set to rise, with an estimated 3.2 million cases of CRC globally in the year 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the USA alone, CRC is estimated to rise from approximately 150â160,000 cases in 2020 to between 180 and 210,000 cases by 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been well established that early detection and removal of colorectal neoplasia, including CRC and pre-cursor lesions called adenomatous polyps (adenomas), can prevent many deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for detection and/or removal of such lesions. Following the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasia, ongoing regular surveillance colonoscopy is recommended. However, with expected large increases in the rates of CRC diagnoses, the workload demand on hospitals to perform the associated increase in surveillance colonoscopies will only become more cumbersome in what are already strained health care systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, although uncommon, the procedure carries an element of risk to the patient, with adverse events from anesthesia, bleeding or perforation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Most importantly, over 85% of individuals at elevated risk of CRC undergoing surveillance colonoscopy due to prior neoplasia or a family history of CRC have no significant findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], demonstrating the potential overutilization of colonoscopy in this population. There is clearly a need to identify those individuals who do not need such intensive colonoscopy surveillance.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Screening using the non-invasive fecal immunochemical occult blood tests (FITs) for detection of fecal hemoglobin (F-Hb) shed from neoplastic lesions, with colonoscopy follow-up for those testing positive, can effectively reduce CRC incidence, severity, and mortality. This is through diagnosing cancers earlier and by detecting and removing the pre-cursor lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. FIT has a good sensitivity for detection of CRC at 65â87% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the concentration of Hb in the feces is positively associated with risk of advanced neoplasia (advanced adenoma or CRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This association has also been observed in individuals with Hb concentrations below the positivity threshold. In the Dutch national screening program, the risk of advanced neoplasia was significantly higher for individuals with fecal Hb concentrations just below the positivity threshold, compared to those returning a fecal Hb of 0Â Âµg Hb/g feces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This was also supported in their follow-up findings that analyzed multiple rounds of screening, where individuals with undetectable and low (&lt;â2Â Âµg Hb/g feces) concentrations of Hb in the feces had the lowest risk for advanced neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although these studies were performed in an average risk screening population, the FIT sensitivity for CRC in an elevated risk population is 80% with a specificity of 89% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that fecal Hb concentrations from FIT completed before surveillance colonoscopy could be a suitable tool to inform postponement of colonoscopies in those who return a very low fecal Hb concentration, thereby reducing the demand on colonoscopy resources.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Optimizing surveillance colonoscopy frequency is challenging, evident by the changing guidelines implemented in Australia for CRC prevention in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as well as the different recommendations around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While there are studies supporting the benefits of CRC screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the benefits and cost-effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy are less clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], due to limited prospective data. A study using simulation models in the USA suggested that a 10-year colonoscopy interval was more cost-effective than a 5-year interval, whereas an intensive surveillance of 3-yearly intervals was more harmful and resulted in reduced quality-adjusted life years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It may be possible to guide optimal surveillance intervals using quantitative FIT, to balance cancer prevention and overutilization of colonoscopy procedures. When modelling surveillance strategies to compare annual FIT to 5-yearly colonoscopy, FIT was deemed to be as effective and less costly than colonoscopy; it reduced the number of colonoscopies by 45% and was associated with a lower rate of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Personalizing surveillance based on FIT Hb concentration would lead to a reduction in the number of colonoscopies. Determining the cost savings of extending surveillance intervals in this context is now needed to justify such changes to clinical care.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Any changes to clinical policy that involves a change to the interval between colonoscopies based on FIT Hb concentration could result in distress amongst consumers. Participants may experience reservations about the efficacy of FIT in detecting abnormalities (i.e., lower response efficacy for FIT than colonoscopy) and have, as a result, greater anxiety and fear of cancer, resulting in decreased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Alternatively, it may be the colonoscopy procedure itself causing distress. Preference for different surveillance strategies is likely to be, at least in part, dependent on perceived or anticipated participant burden, which influences uptake in CRC screening programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Perceived inconvenience is a significant predictor of compliance with healthcare recommendations, particularly among some under-served groups in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is therefore possible that individuals at increased risk for CRC will accept changes to surveillance strategies if they perceive the change to be less onerous and as effective. This could also be related to health activation, which describes the skills, confidence, and knowledge a person has in managing their own health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recent small studies have explored participantsâ responses to a possible change to the surveillance process. Participants varied in level of CRC risk but, regardless of risk level, it was reported that an annual FIT was preferred over three yearly colonoscopies in those with no experience of surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Conversely, those with a surveillance history believed that colonoscopy would be more accurate than FIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This suggests differences in either perceived response efficacy for the two approaches, or a reluctance to change usual practice, or both. It is therefore important to evaluate participant response to actual change in surveillance practice.</p>
              <p id="Par9">The use of FIT Hb concentrations could be a simple and effective way to personalize surveillance colonoscopy frequency. To our knowledge, there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCT) to determine if colonoscopy surveillance intervals can be safely extended in elevated risk CRC surveillance cohorts based on prior low FIT Hb concentration. Based on this, we have designed a randomized controlled trial in a cohort of individuals undergoing regular surveillance colonoscopy, to assess the safety, acceptance, and cost-effectiveness of extending the frequency of colonoscopy based on FIT Hb concentration.</p>

The participant will be scheduled a new procedure date within 6Â months of the study colonoscopy procedure date. If the repeat procedure is not completed within 6Â months of the study colonoscopy date, the data are excluded from the outcome analysis. The rate of poor bowel preparation (a quantitative BBPS score of less than 2 in any segment, or a qualitative bowel preparation report of âpoorâ) in the SCOOP program is approximately 5%, which is within the Australian National Health and Medical Research council recommendation of 10% for colonoscopy key performance indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. If more than 10% of colonoscopy procedures are being excluded due to poor bowel prep, recruitment of participants will continue until the minimum required sample size has been met. The colonoscopy will be performed by trained endoscopists and under anesthesia or sedation. After informed consent is documented, the scope is passed under direct vision with the patientâs pulse and oxygen saturations monitored throughout. The colonoscope is introduced through the anus and advanced to the cecum, which can be identified by the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. Scope withdrawal time is recorded from cecum to rectum. Polyp findings from the colonoscopy are recorded including the Paris classification, location, size, and resection type.</p>

High-risk sessile serrated lesions are defined as those with dysplasia and/orââ¥â10Â mm in size. Non-advanced adenomas and low-risk sessile serrated lesions will be defined as precursor adenomas that do not fit the advanced adenoma or high-risk sessile serrated lesion criteria. Non-neoplastic findings will include hyperplastic polyps, diverticular disease, hemorrhoids, and angiodysplasia, and absence of pathology will be defined as a normal outcome.</p>

The lifetime estimates of effect on survival, quality of life, and costs will be estimated from a comprehensive literature review. Both costs and benefits will be discounted at 5% in the base model, in line with government policy.</p>

                  <title>Consumer acceptability</title>
                  <p id="Par48">Overall preference for and satisfaction with surveillance type and frequency scenarios will be assessed by direct questions and the DCEs, giving different scenarios of methodology (colonoscopy with or without FIT), frequency, and effectiveness. Themes analyzed include (1) how acceptable they find a modified protocol, (2) how likely they would be to comply with it, and (3) how anxious the changes would make them. The collected demographic and clinical variables will be used to determine if there are any associations with surveillance preferences, and these will include: sex, age, number of previous colonoscopies, number of previous FITs, risk level for CRC (i.e., family history or previous adenoma), time since previous colonoscopy, or FIT. Individual differences in psychological measures will be collected to identify any measures that are likely to predict surveillance preferences: fear of cancer, quality of life, trust in healthcare, perceived convenience of FIT versus colonoscopy, dissatisfaction with previous procedures, relative differences in perceived response efficacy between the two, anxiety about change, and consumer health activation, and self-efficacy for FIT and colonoscopy. Health activation measurement will be with the Consumer Health Activation index (CHAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] which comprises 10 items designed to assess a consumerâs health activation level, where high health activation is positively associated with health self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test will compare satisfaction between subjects offered the extended or standard surveillance protocol. A multivariable logistic regression analysis will be applied to determine predictors of preferences for surveillance type and frequency. Independent variables that are not linear on the log-odds scale will be categorized or transformed.</p>

              <p id="Par49">This RCT has been designed to evaluate the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and consumer acceptability of using FIT to extend colonoscopy surveillance intervals for individuals who are considered at elevated risk of CRC. The design process was implemented to minimize introduction of bias and to ensure the safety of all participants involved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT of its kind to utilize the FIT to personalize surveillance intervals in an elevated risk cohort.</p>
              <p id="Par50">The primary outcome of this study will be to assess incidence of advanced neoplasia in those individuals with a low FIT Hb concentration who have an on-time colonoscopy dictated by current guidelines versus those with a delayed colonoscopy procedure. Prospective studies in average and elevated risk cohorts have shown that the incidence of advanced neoplasia in those with low or undetectable fecal Hb are low. A study by Digby et al. showed that participants with a personal history of adenoma or a family of CRC (elevated CRC risk) who returned a fecal Hb levelââ¤â2Â Âµg Hb/g had a 7.3% rate of advanced neoplasia at colonoscopy, and for those with undetectable fecal Hb (0 Hb/g), the rate was only 2.8%, which is equivalent to an overall relative risk reduction of 59.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Senore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] demonstrated that in a population-wide screening program of average-risk individuals, a combined undetectable fecal Hb from multiple previous rounds of FIT (about 50% of the participants) led to a 1.4% risk of finding an advanced neoplasia over the subsequent two rounds of colonoscopy compared to those with a FIT Hb levelââ¥â20Â Âµg/g (about 0.7% of the population) who had an 18-fold increase in their cumulative advanced neoplasia risk over the same time interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The Dutch CRC screening work group conducted a large-scale prognostic model that used Hb concentrations from two biennial FIT rounds to predict colonoscopy outcomes (advanced neoplasia) after a third round of a positive FIT (â¥â47Â Âµg Hb/g feces) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Their data showed that only 1.8% of individuals with low Hb in the feces in the first FIT round were diagnosed with advanced neoplasia after a third round positive FIT, and only 3.9% were diagnosed with advanced neoplasia after a low Hb at FIT round 2. Collectively, these data report a low risk for advanced neoplasia in individuals with a low FIT Hb concentration, which supports the plan to extend surveillance colonoscopy intervals in individuals with low fecal Hb. However, a limitation of these studies was that outcomes were only measured in those that eventually had a positive FIT with colonoscopy follow-up or in those incidentally diagnosed with interval cancer. Those with a negative FIT result were not followed up with colonoscopy to determine the actual incidence of advanced neoplasia. RCTs are now needed to validate these findings in an unbiased manner to provide evidence to support changing current surveillance colonoscopy guidelines.</p>
              <p id="Par51">While assessing the risk of developing advanced neoplasia is crucial to the outcome of this study, one of the secondary outcomes from this study will be to determine what costs might be saved with the proposed changes to surveillance guidelines. In Australia, the use of colonoscopy has been rising for over two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], but the capacity for this costly and invasive procedure in a strained public healthcare system is limited. The impact that colonoscopy has on the environment is also significant, in part due to the sheer case load of patients every year, carbon heavy travel required for patients and their support person to attend appointments, various waste streams that use copious amounts of water, high consumption of single-use consumables, and resource-heavy decontamination processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The procedure also requires a time commitment of at least 3Â days away from normal activities to allow the completion of bowel preparation the day before, sedation/anesthesia on the day of the procedure, and followed by a recovery day. This time away from normal duties can have a significant impact on economic productivity due to the required absences. An RCT that demonstrates the actual cost savings in reducing the number of colonoscopies each year, while minimizing the impact of incidence of advanced colorectal neoplasia, will provide the evidence needed to support implementing changes to policy guidelines on CRC surveillance.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Another key secondary outcome of the planned study will investigate preferences for surveillance strategies, as well as the associated influencing variables within a large cohort from the SCOOP program, in order to identify whether the proposed changes to colonoscopy surveillance guidelines using FIT are acceptable. The strength in surveying this group is that they have undergone surveillance colonoscopy as well as being offered interval screening with FIT as part of the SCOOP program already. Earlier studies have shown that the regardless of an individualâs risk for developing CRC (i.e. average or elevated), a FIT offered to participants annually was preferred over a 3-yearly colonoscopy in individuals who had never undergone surveillance colonoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, those individuals who had already participated in CRC surveillance colonoscopy believed that colonoscopy would be more accurate than FIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These studies suggest that there are not only differences in response efficacy (i.e., whether they believe the recommended surveillance strategy will detect the neoplasia) between colonoscopy and FIT, but that there may be hesitancy for individuals to change standard practice based on these beliefs. The reported RCT study design presented here will provide the evidence needed to answer these questions in an unbiased approach.</p>
              <p id="Par53">There are some limitations to this study. There is uncertainty around consent and participation rates in a cohort of individuals who are already aware that they are at above-average risk for developing CRC and whom have already been informed by their primary care physicians and proceduralists that they are required to perform these colonoscopies regularly and on time. This may lead to only individuals who are personally comfortable to delay their colonoscopy procedure enrolling in the study, thereby creating a bias in the population. Furthermore, potential reluctance of eligible participants in delaying their procedure could also lead to lower than anticipated sample size, which may impact data analysis. Finally, although this study will be limited to an Australian population at elevated risk of CRC due to a personal history of adenomas and/or a significant family history of CRC, findings could be interpreted to support implementing the same strategy to those who undergo colonoscopy only and are at average risk for CRC, as is the case in the USA.</p>
              <p id="Par54">In conclusion, we report the study design of an RCT that is expected to determine the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and consumer acceptability of personalizing colonoscopy surveillance intervals using FIT. The results from this study will create an evidence-base for recommendations that would be implementable in clinical practice and practice changing with national guidelines. Such outcomes have the capacity to reduce the burden placed on hospital resources and provide an overall improved patient experience, without increasing the incidence rate of advanced colorectal neoplasia.</p>
