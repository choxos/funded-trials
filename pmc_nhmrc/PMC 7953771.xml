                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Successful implementation and long-term maintenance of healthy supermarkets initiatives are crucial to achieving potential population health benefits. Understanding barriers and enablers of implementation of real-world trials will enhance wide-scale implementation. This process evaluation of a healthy supermarket intervention sought to describe (i) customer, retailer and stakeholder perspectives on the intervention; (ii) intervention implementation; and (iii) implementation barriers and enablers.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2"><italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> was a 12-month randomised controlled trial conducted in 11 Independent Grocers of Australia (IGA) chain supermarkets in regional Victoria, Australia (5 intervention and 6 wait-listed control stores). Intervention components included trolley and basket signage, local area and in-store promotion, and shelf tags highlighting the healthiest packaged foods. A sequential mixed-methods process evaluation was undertaken. Customer exit surveys investigated demographics, and intervention recall and perceptions. Logistic mixed-models estimated associations between customer responses and demographics, with store as random effect. Supermarket staff surveys investigated staff demographics, interactions with customers, and intervention component feedback. Semi-structured stakeholder interviews with local government, retail and academic partners explored intervention perceptions, and factors which enabled or inhibited implementation, maintenance and scalability. Interviews were inductively coded to identify key themes.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Of 500 customers surveyed, 33%[95%CI:23,44] recalled the <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> brand and 97%[95%CI:93,99] agreed that IGA should continue its efforts to encourage healthy eating. The 82 staff surveyed demonstrated very favourable intervention perceptions. Themes from 19 interviews included that business models favour sales of unhealthy foods, and that stakeholder collaboration was crucial to intervention design and implementation. Staff surveys and interviews highlighted the need to minimise staff time for project maintenance and to regularly refresh intervention materials to increase and maintain salience among customers.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This process evaluation found that interventions to promote healthy diets in supermarkets can be perceived as beneficial by retailers, customers, and government partners provided that barriers including staff time and intervention salience are addressed. Collaborative partnerships in intervention design and implementation, including retailers, governments, and academics, show potential for encouraging long-term sustainability of interventions.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">Supermarkets are the leading source of food and beverage purchases globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and are therefore a major influence on population diet and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The small number of in-store supermarket interventions designed to promote healthier diets (‘healthy supermarket initiatives’) conducted to date have demonstrated short-term potential to improve the healthiness of consumer purchases by changing aspects of the ‘4Ps’ of marketing: Product, Promotion, Place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and/or Price [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to favour healthier foods and beverages. Population health benefits require such changes to be maintained in the long-term. Understanding the barriers and enablers of successful implementation and maintenance can provide useful information for wide-scale implementation of healthy supermarket initiatives and therefore should be a research priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">The sustainability of healthy supermarket interventions refers to both the maintenance of the intervention and capacity to sustain intervention effects into the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This may depend on a number of interrelated factors associated with the interventions themselves and the context within which they are implemented. Process evaluations of previous supermarket and grocery store interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have identified barriers to implementation and sustainability that include excessive retailer staff time and resource requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], whereas enablers included perceived high customer satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and improved retail brand image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">We are not aware of any mixed-methods process evaluations of supermarket initiatives that have considered the perspectives of customers, staff and other key stakeholders together. Critically, previous supermarket interventions and related process evaluations have generally been conducted 3 to 6 months into a project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Process evaluations of supermarket interventions over the longer-term are essential to determine the potential for real-world sustainability and scalability, which relies on changes being maintained and adapted at scale over many months or years.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Here, we conduct an evaluation during and following a 12-month supermarket healthy eating intervention, ‘<italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic>’ which aimed to improve the healthiness of customer purchases and increase sales of healthier packaged products and fresh produce. The process evaluation sought to investigate the experiences of customers, staff and stakeholders involved in <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> development and implementation. The objectives were to (i) describe customer, retailer and stakeholder perspectives of the <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> intervention; (ii) describe intervention implementation and any variation across intervention sites; and (iii) explore barriers and enablers of implementation.</p>

                <title>Overview</title>
                <p id="Par16">An overview of the development, timelines, and methods used in the <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The timeline specific to the process evaluation is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Timeline of <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> randomised controlled trial and process evaluation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12966_2021_1104_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par17">Briefly, the <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> project began in 2015 as a series of three short-term retailer-conceived healthy supermarket trials, implemented and evaluated in collaboration with local government and academic partners. The <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was a 12-month, multi-component intervention conducted between May 2017 and May 2018 in 11 Independent Grocers of Australia (IGA) supermarket stores in regional Victoria, Australia (5 intervention and 6 wait-listed control stores). Stores were recruited for RCT participation via the supermarket advertising collective of seven store owners (total 11 stores), which included the supermarkets that participated in the initial short-term trials. All stores agreed to participate in the intervention and evaluation.</p>
                <p id="Par18">The intervention included three components: (i) signage (trolley and basket signs, floor signs, aisle fins, healthy food posters, and shelf signs (“wobblers”)); (ii) local area and in-store promotion (flyers (mailers and in-store), social media, and launch event and related media); and (iii) shelf tags highlighting (healthiest) packaged foods store-wide (defined as all products with 4.5 or 5 stars according to the voluntary government-endorsed Australian and New Zealand front-of-pack Health Star Rating (HSR) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). The process evaluation of the multi-component intervention is the focus of the current paper. A summary of the results of the <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> RCT on supermarket sales has been published separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Briefly, preliminary results based on multi-level modelling show that the <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> intervention was associated with slight significant increases in the sales of products with a Health Star Rating of 4.5 or higher, and in sales of fruits and vegetables, but had no significant effect on overall sales of healthy ‘core’ food according to the Australian Dietary Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Retailers reported that there was no overall effect of the intervention on profit.</p>
                <p id="Par19">In addition, researchers collected intervention monitoring data to establish the fidelity of implementation (findings to be published in a separate paper alongside changes in supermarket sales). In summary, initial dose of intervention components varied across stores, mainly due to variation in store size. HSR shelf tags and trolley and basket signs were maintained at close to 100% fidelity throughout the intervention period. Display of posters, aisle fins and shelf wobblers initially increased as store staff gradually implemented all the signage, and then decreased from October 2017 to the end of the official intervention period in May 2018.</p>
                <p id="Par20">A sequential mixed-methods process evaluation was undertaken that included customer surveys (October 2017), staff surveys (August 2018) and qualitative stakeholder interviews (August to October 2018) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par21">Customer surveys were conducted in the five intervention stores during the trial period, and staff surveys and stakeholder interviews were conducted in both the five intervention stores and the six wait-listed control stores after completion of the trial (May 2018) when both intervention and wait-listed control stores were self-maintaining the intervention. We used findings from customer surveys to develop methods for subsequent staff surveys, and then used customer and staff survey findings to develop interviews (explained in detail below).</p>
                <p id="Par22">Constructs for investigation and selection of measurement tools were informed by: established process evaluation frameworks including RE-AIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; the Diffusion of Innovations theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] which describes how an idea or innovation is spread and adopted within a social system and characteristics of interventions likely to spread; Baranowski and Stables’ methodological guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] to assessment of key process evaluation constructs; as well as the intervention’s program logic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par23">Customer exit surveys were conducted at all five intervention stores approximately 6 months into the intervention (October 2017) to collect self-reported data on (i) intervention reach including customer demographics; (ii) recall of the intervention; (iii) perceptions of overall intervention, specific intervention components, and potential alternate or additional interventions (measured on seven-point Likert scales; 1 = ‘strongly dislike’, 7 = ‘strongly like’); and (iv) perceptions of overall intervention and individual component effectiveness in promoting healthier choices. Survey questions were developed based on constructs relevant to the specific intervention components, informed by previous retail customer surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and adapted from questions successfully piloted in the three previous <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> short-term trials.

                  <p id="Par24">Exiting customers at the five stores who were aged 18 years or older and the main grocery buyer in their household were invited to self-complete the approximately 10-min, anonymous, paper-based survey. Sample size was decided based on pragmatic considerations and considering the primary purpose of the survey that was to provide feedback to the retailers on customer satisfaction and intervention component recall. A sample of 100 customers per intervention store was considered large enough to estimate the prevalence of binary outcomes with 95% confidence intervals which in the worst case (50% prevalence) would have a 20% total width.</p>

                  <title>Analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par25">Customer perceptions of intervention components and suggestions for additional healthy food initiatives at the survey store were dichotomised for analysis due to extreme skewness of the distribution of the responses to many questions (1 to 4 = unfavourable or neutral impression/ unsupportive or neutral support; 5 to 7 = favourable impression/ supportive). Customer demographics were also dichotomised: age (18 to 54 years; 55 years and older), gender (male; female), area-based socioeconomic status according to postcode (Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (lower half of SEIFA percentiles; upper half of SEIFA percentiles), educational attainment (less than university degree; university degree or higher), and frequency of customer visits (never, rarely or sometimes shop at survey store; always or usually shop at store). Heterogeneity of customer demographics across stores was assessed using the Chi-squared test. Overall proportion of customers in each demographic group (and 95% CI), and associations between customers’ perceptions and customer demographic variables were estimated using mixed-effects logistic models with the demographic variable as a fixed effect and store as random effect to account for the clustering induced by store. The intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is reported as a measure of variability of customer recall across stores.</p>

Of those who said that trolley and/or basket signs had influenced their purchases, 69%[95%CI:49,84] reported that signs increased purchases of foods which corresponded to the core food groups from The Australian Dietary Guidelines (grains; vegetables and legumes/ beans; fruit; lean meats and alternatives; and dairy and alternatives) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

                <p id="Par40">A total of 82 staff from 11 stores completed surveys in August to September 2018 (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, Table S4 for respondent demographics). No differences were found in staff characteristics between intervention and wait-listed control store surveys, hence we present overall results. The most frequent respondent role was department manager (29%). Eighty percent of staff had been employed in their particular store for 2 years or more, meaning that they had been employed prior to the implementation of <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic>. Most respondents (84%) reported that they had not been directly involved with installation or maintenance of <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic>.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Staff had very favourable perceptions of <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> overall (median 6 [5, 7] on 7-point Likert scale) and specific intervention components (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, Table S5). The most frequently cited components that “worked well” were trolley/ basket signs (27% respondents), followed by HSR shelf tags (11%) and floor sign (11%), which staff reported to be the most noticeable by customers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, Table S6). The most frequently cited components that “did not work well” were the HSR shelf tags (17% respondents), followed by shelf signs (10%). The tags were noted to fall off easily. The shelf signs were noted to both fall off easily and get in the way of other products and signage (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, Table S7). Most staff (78%) had rarely or never received feedback from customers relating to <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> or its components (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, Table S8). The majority of feedback received, however, was very or slightly positive (e.g. “sending a positive message to customers”), or otherwise neutral (e.g. “[customer surprised] at the low star rating of products”). Only one respondent reported receiving “slightly negative” customer feedback, and none reported “very negative” feedback.</p>
                <p id="Par42">The majority of staff (93%) thought <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> would be maintained at their store in the future. Reasons for thinking the intervention would not be maintained varied but comments included “It’s not maintained now either”, and that profit would be the main driver of supermarket strategies (e.g. “[price] specials sell first”). Respondents were asked to rank seven additional healthy eating strategies from least to most effective in terms of whether they would help customers make healthy choices (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, Table S9). The highest median ranked option was “Price discounts on healthy foods and drinks” (2 [1, 3] out of 7). The lowest ranked was “One checkout that doesn’t display unhealthy food” (7 [6, 7]).</p>

                  <p id="Par44">Interviewees described multiple contextual factors that influenced the implementation of <italic>Eat Well @ IGA </italic>– namely, the broader supermarket industry context (defined as traditional business operations focused around sales and profitability) and the public health context (defined as the current health issues experienced by the target communities).

                  <p id="Par45">From an industry perspective, standard <italic>Supermarket operations</italic> were generally seen as a hindrance to implementing and sustaining healthy changes as business models tend to favour promoting sales of unhealthy foods and beverages because of perceived consumer demand and supplier contract agreements (e.g. <italic>Status quo is unhealthy; Power of conglomerates</italic>). However, broader <italic>Industry change</italic> was occurring in response to <italic>Customer trend</italic>s towards healthy eating, particularly by health-conscious consumers and those with children; this increased the retailers’ interest in implementing <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic>.<disp-quote><p id="Par46">“I think the whole market's starting to change… people gravitating towards all those healthier type products.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par60">This process evaluation of the complex supermarket intervention <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> demonstrated that it had high support from customers, staff and broader stakeholders. Key learnings included barriers around staff time required for intervention maintenance and perceptions of reduced salience of the intervention over time among customers due to the ubiquitous marketing noise in the modern retail environment. The collaborative partnership and co-participation between stakeholders – what we have termed “co-design” – was a key enabler of planning, implementation and future directions of the project.</p>
              <p id="Par61">Findings from this study align with previous evaluations of supermarket and grocery store interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], including the identification of staff time as a key barrier to sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our stakeholder interviews have extended these previous studies by revealing that these concerns persisted at 12 months. Key concerns related to the opportunity cost of staff time (i.e. staff time spent on <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> instead of other projects) and the expected return on investment of the time and effort involved in intervention implementation, rather than the financial cost or number of staff hours required per se, which was estimated around 1–4 h per month.</p>
              <p id="Par62">Our use of the Diffusion of Innovations theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Baranowski and Stables’ process evaluation guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] in survey and interview question design helped to provide insights into whether or not <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> embodied the usual characteristics of scalable innovations. For example, interviewees expressed conflicting views on the Diffusion of Innovation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] characteristic of “compatibility” of the intervention with status quo supermarket operations. On the one hand, most stakeholders acknowledged that status quo operations tend to favour unhealthy foods and beverages. On the other hand, some stakeholders including retailers expressed hope that it might address perceived increasing consumer demand for healthier supermarket offerings. Senior IGA stakeholders discussed advantages (e.g. potential profit increases) and disadvantages (e.g. increased staff time) of the intervention in relation to current practice (described by the Diffusion of Innovations theory as “Relative advantage” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). Future monitoring of IGA networks will be required to determine whether <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> does in fact diffuse to other IGA stores.</p>
              <p id="Par63">Low customer recall of the <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> brand (33% [95%CI:23, 44]) and project components was indicated by both customer surveys and noted in some stakeholder interviews. Staff survey results suggested that salience of the intervention decreased over time. As such, promotional material may need to be periodically refreshed to remain effective and to cut-through the visual noise in the supermarket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The issue of salience decreasing over time has not been a key finding of other relevant process evaluations, perhaps due to the shorter timeframe of previous evaluations, and the modest size of the current merchandising-based intervention. Alternatively, the effectiveness of the intervention may not just depend on recall, but rather the intervention may work by a variety of psychological mechanisms. For example, many of the trolley and shelf signs targeted social norms around healthy eating. Future healthy food retail interventions that utilise marketing messages should plan for regularly refreshing campaign materials, while considering intervention cost and sustainability, and targeting different psychological pathways of effect.</p>
              <p id="Par64">Another novel component of our evaluation was examination of variation in customer recall and perceptions of components across stores. We found moderate variation in recall across stores, which may reflect extent of implementation. Higher recall of HSR shelf-tags, posters and shelf-signs was found among younger compared to older respondents in the customer survey. This may be related to age-related cognitive declines in attention, and aligns with stakeholder interviews which suggested that younger, health-conscious consumers (especially those with young families) engaged more with the project.</p>
              <p id="Par65">We found customers demonstrated extremely high self-reported support for <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> and further changes to improve the healthiness of the in-store supermarket environment; however, staff and stakeholders reported limited customer feedback (positive or negative). A recent review of business outcomes in healthy food retail initiatives found that 65% of measured customer perception outcomes were favourable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. While customer perceptions were not a focus of stakeholder interviews, positive impacts on brand image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] were central to supermarket stakeholder’s assessment of commercial viability. This was aligned with the IGA chain brand slogan “how the locals like it” and supermarket stakeholders’ references to industry growth in healthy food sales in Australia, which has also been recently identified in interviews with US supermarket retailers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par66">Customers expressed support for other potential changes to encourage healthier purchases, including healthier end of aisle displays and the availability of healthy recipes. This is consistent with other evaluations of similar interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Accordingly, these intervention components should be considered as part of future initiatives. Nonetheless, there are likely to be important barriers to implementing these suggestions as end of aisle displays are frequently dictated by contractual agreements with manufacturers, as highlighted by several interviewees.</p>
              <p id="Par67">The most important intervention outcomes specified by interviewees varied according to retailer role, with store staff focusing on staff resourcing needed for day-to-day intervention maintenance, and store managers and executives focused on community health outcomes and brand image. The strongest support for <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> was expressed by stakeholders who prioritised the value of the intervention on community health outcomes. Whether the staff from smaller, community-based supermarkets such as IGA rate community health and goodwill more highly than staff from larger chain supermarkets (who often have less direct relationships with their local community) could not be determined in the current study. Moreover, suppliers were not identified by interviewees as a key barrier to implementation, despite being raised in previous interviews with supermarket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and small grocery store managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This was likely because the current intervention did not involve changes in product placement or availability.</p>
              <p id="Par68">Considerable emphasis was placed on the value of the co-design approach between retailers, government and academic partners by those directly involved in the project development. Perceived advantages included the diverse attributes that different partners brought to the project including the credibility provided by local government and university participation, government funding, nutrition and research skills, and supermarket operations knowledge. Consistent with other community health promotion partnerships, our stakeholders identified challenges of academic and funding timelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but also the dividends including sustainability brought by time investment in partnerships. Our findings were also in line with other supermarket-academic partnerships which have noted that co-design elements in planning, implementation and evaluation have been essential to programme sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par69">There was strong support among the three main stakeholder groups (local government, supermarket, academic partners) for the partnership and <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> to continue, provided modifications were made regarding HSR tags and refreshing of the materials, which could otherwise hinder intervention uptake. Some supermarket senior stakeholders required a profit increase directly attributable to the intervention to continue to support the project, while for most a neutral sales effect was sufficient given the perceived benefits to brand image and community wellbeing. There was uncertainty among interviewees about what the next steps should be, noting organisational and resourcing difficulties with scale-up to other IGAs. A 2016 systematic review found no evidence examining the scale-up of a supermarket intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; addressing this gap will be critical to increasing the population impact of healthy food retail initiatives, which must be maintained long-term across many settings to drive meaningful population health changes.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par70">This research used a theory-driven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] sequential mixed-methods design to examine a complex supermarket intervention from the complementary perspectives of different stakeholders. Demonstrating the value of the mixed-methods approach, qualitative and quantitative data sources were sometimes concordant (e.g. customer intervention recall), and at other times discordant (e.g. customer intervention support in customer surveys was not reflected in staff surveys). The 12-month time frame of the intervention provided a longer-term perspective on maintenance and sustainability of supermarket initiatives. Views of customers and staff surveyed may not be representative of the target population groups, as it is possible those who had more extreme views (positive or negative) were more likely to respond to surveys. Although we did not have data on all customer demographics, we found that surveyed customers tended to be older and to have a higher socioeconomic position than the general population (and therefore likely customers overall). The views of stakeholders may also change over time, noting that some stakeholders (retail and other) had been involved in healthy eating initiatives for up to 4 years prior to this evaluation. Repeated longitudinal assessment of the opinions of retail stakeholders throughout all phases of the intervention process would be of interest in future initiatives.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par71">This process evaluation of the 12-month <italic>Eat Well @ IGA</italic> supermarket RCT found that the retailer-academic-government partnership and co-design process was critical for the development and maintenance of this intervention. These findings are an important accompaniment to the outcome data on the effectiveness of the intervention, and will aid in interpretation of those findings. Our learnings emphasised the importance of limiting retailer time and costs and the need for periodic refreshment of point-of-sale marketing materials to maintain customer salience. Identifying and implementing factors that lead to long-term sustainable and widespread healthy supermarket initiatives is critical to realising the potential population health benefits of healthy supermarket initiatives.</p>
