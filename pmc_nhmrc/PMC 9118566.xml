                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Kidney failure prevalence is increasing worldwide. Haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation are undertaken to extend life with kidney failure. People receiving haemodialysis commonly experience fatigue, pain, nausea, cramping, itching, sleeping difficulties, anxiety and depression. This symptom burden contributes to poor health-related quality of life (QOL) and is a major reason for treatment withdrawal and death. The Symptom monitoring WIth Feedback Trial (SWIFT) will test the hypothesis that regular symptom monitoring with feedback to people receiving haemodialysis and their treating clinical team can improve QOL.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We are conducting an Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry-based cluster randomised controlled trial to determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness at 12 months, of 3-monthly symptom monitoring using the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale-Renal (IPOS-Renal) survey with clinician feedback, compared with usual care among adults treated with haemodialysis. Participants complete symptom scoring using a tablet, which are provided to participants and to clinicians. The trial aims to recruit 143 satellite haemodialysis centres, (up to 2400 participants). The primary outcome is change in health-related QOL, as measured by EuroQol 5-Dimension, 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, symptom severity (including haemodialysis-associated fatigue), healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">SWIFT is the first registry-based trial in the Australian haemodialysis population to investigate whether regular symptom monitoring with feedback to participants and clinicians improves QOL. SWIFT is embedded in the ANZDATA Registry facilitating pragmatic recruitment from public and private dialysis clinics, throughout Australia. SWIFT will inform future collection, storage and reporting of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) within a clinical quality registry. As the first trial to rigorously estimate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of routine PROMs collection and reporting in haemodialysis units, SWIFT will provide invaluable information to health services, clinicians and researchers working to improve the lives of those with kidney failure.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par20">Kidney disease, consisting of chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI) and kidney failure, affects 850 million people globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. People with kidney failure can receive kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in the form of either dialysis or kidney transplantation to extend life. It is predicted that by the year 2030, the need for KRT will reach approximately 5.4 million people, the majority in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Dialysis, the most common KRT worldwide, has significant costs yet results in only 51% survival at 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], lower than all cancers combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Australia in 2020, 13,931 people were receiving dialysis; 10,470 (75%) in haemodialysis facilities (non-hospital or hospital) with 9% undertaking haemodialysis at home and a further 16% performing peritoneal dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par21">Facility-based haemodialysis typically requires three treatment sessions per week for 3 to 5 h per session. This treatment removes solutes and fluid directly from the blood; however, people receiving this therapy frequently report symptoms of fatigue, pain, nausea, cramping, hypotension, itching, sleeping difficulties, anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is reflected in the low quality of life (QOL) of people receiving facility-based haemodialysis, with self-reported QOL at 59% of full health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This is lower than the self-reported QOL of people with metastatic prostate cancer or spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par22">Overwhelming symptoms and poor QOL can lead to dialysis withdrawal and death. In 2020, the ANZDATA Registry reported 575 deaths (34% of all haemodialysis deaths) attributed to withdrawal of haemodialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Of these, 202 (35%) were due to psychosocial reasons, including symptom burden and poor QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More frequent or longer dialysis sessions may reduce some symptoms; however, this strategy may only result in small improvements in QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Symptom management improves QOL and survival in other disease conditions. In cancer care, symptom monitoring during routine chemotherapy improved survival compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Symptom management in palliative care improved QOL, reduced symptoms and increased functional wellbeing compared with standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) including symptom monitoring is recommended to guide clinical care for many conditions; however, few trials have assessed the effectiveness of this intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In haemodialysis populations, although effective targeted management of symptoms is associated with improved QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], evidence is lacking from randomised controlled trials (RCT).</p>
                <p id="Par23">In 2020, we completed a SWIFT pilot study among four dialysis units in South Australia and Queensland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Both patients and clinicians found the tablet computers easy to use and felt that electronic collection of PROMs was useful and important for patients’ QOL. The pilot concluded that electronic symptom monitoring in adults on haemodialysis with feedback to clinicians was feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Lessons learned from the pilot have shaped the design of the main trial.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par24">SWIFT evaluates the hypothesis that regular symptom monitoring with feedback to people receiving haemodialysis and their clinicians improves QOL at 12 months. SWIFT is a registry-based cluster RCT to determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of 3-monthly symptom monitoring using the validated Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale – Renal (IPOS-Renal) survey. The intervention includes symptom score feedback to adult haemodialysis participants and clinicians with links to evidence-based symptom management also sent to clinicians. Secondary outcomes include survival, frequency and severity of symptoms (including haemodialysis-associated fatigue), biochemical measures of dialysis adequacy, dialysis duration and frequency, dialysis withdrawal and healthcare utilisation. In addition, the trial is investigating whether electronic capture of patient-reported outcomes within a clinical quality registry at a national level is feasible and cost-effective.</p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par25">The trial is a prospective registry-based cluster randomised controlled trial of 3-monthly electronic symptom collection using IPOS-Renal with feedback to clinicians and participants versus usual care for adults managed with centre haemodialysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This trial followed the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (see Supplementary Material). Haemodialysis centres (the clusters) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio with linked parent/satellite centres forced to the same allocated intervention to account for patient movement between centres. The trial will be conducted and reported according to the CONSORT 2010 checklist for reporting a cluster randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and patient-reported outcomes in trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The CHEERS guidelines will guide reporting of cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial schema for SWIFT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6355_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par26">SWIFT is being conducted in both public and private haemodialysis centres across Australia. These are centres that are predominantly nurse-managed with visiting on-site physician attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Haemodialysis is covered by publicly funded healthcare coverage and is primarily provided by state-run health networks. Some networks have contracted private providers for some or all satellite dialysis services. Regardless of provider, all dialysis care is free to the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and all dialysis units send patient data to the ANZDATA Registry.</p>

                  <p id="Par27">All centres contributing to the ANZDATA Registry (a bi-national registry which covers all chronic dialysis providers) with a minimum of 10 patients are eligible for participation. Within these centres, adults aged 18 years and older, who are willing and able to adhere to all trial requirements and able to provide informed consent, will be invited to participate. In order to encourage participation of those from a culturally and linguistically diverse background, SWIFT has translated survey materials for adults who read simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Arabic, Greek or Italian text. Centres currently using the IPOS-Renal questionnaire for symptom assessment are still eligible to participate if they agree to use the tablet-based SWIFT data collection and follow the protocol as per their allocation during the trial period.</p>

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par31">As SWIFT is a pragmatic trial, usual care in the dialysis unit (the control arm) is the comparison to symptom monitoring and feedback. Participants in the control arm will not complete electronic 3-monthly IPOS-Renal measures, and the participants and clinicians in the control arm will not receive symptom scores with evidence-based recommendations for their management. Both arms will collect health-related quality of life through the EQ-5D-5L instrument, and these scores will not be fed back to clinicians or participants. Usual care will consist of the dialysis centre’s standard practice for measuring or monitoring symptoms and may constitute no symptom monitoring, ad hoc monitoring and monitoring using other mechanisms, (e.g. questions in a nursing assessment when a dialysis session is commenced, or medical history within a nephrology consultation). The ANZDATA audit of PROMs in haemodialysis centres revealed only around 12% of centres used symptom measures in a routine and systematic way during haemodialysis care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>

                <sec id="Sec15">
                  <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                  <p id="Par32">The intervention comprises regular measurement of symptom burden with feedback of these results to participants and clinicians. Participants in the intervention arm will complete the IPOS-Renal at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months, within a 2-week window (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The individual participant’s IPOS-Renal results will be emailed to the centre nurse unit manager or delegate, and the participant’s treating nephrologist. Within the email will be a link to evidence-based guidelines for symptom management. The evidence-based guidelines were created by SWIFT Investigators (RLM and AKV) and are updated regularly (SWIFT Investigator BS) to ensure new evidence is incorporated. Any symptom score of 3 (severe symptoms) or 4 (overwhelming symptoms) on a scale of 0–4, on the IPOS-Renal instrument will be flagged for prompting clinical review. All subsequent medical treatments are at the discretion of the treating clinicians. Participants receive a copy of the completed survey emailed to them in real-time if they provide an email address at commencement of the survey. Based on our previous work, we anticipate about 30–40% of participants will provide an email address [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

We also hypothesise that symptom monitoring and management may reduce overall and cause-specific mortality (including withdrawal from dialysis).

Of these, 202 (35%) of withdrawals were linked to psycho-social reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

                <p id="Par40">EQ-5D-5L, SONG-HD Fatigue measure and the IPOS-Renal responses will be collected from participants during their haemodialysis sessions. They will be completed electronically on an Android tablet provided to the centres by the trial. The data will be stored in Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Utah, 2021) survey platform, securely transferred daily to the SWIFT module within the ANZDATA Registry. Health-related QOL for both groups will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L (5 domains assessing mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), each with 5 levels of severity, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) on a 0 to 100 scale (0=worst imaginable health, 100= best imaginable health). QOL will be self-reported at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The EQ-5D-5L takes approximately 3 min to complete and is the most widely used and validated preference-based health-related QOL measure among dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is sensitive to poor health states and high symptom burden associated with haemodialysis treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The EQ-5D-5L is the measure that achieves the highest amount of complete data, making it the preferred choice for repeated measures collected within a registry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

                <p id="Par42">SWIFT will recruit 143 haemodialysis centres (or clusters) in Australia. Recruitment data from the SWIFT pilot study confirmed the assumptions of over 50% patient participation in each centre, and 80% completion of EQ-5D-5L at 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Sites are grouped into clusters (see 16a) of approximately 2 sites/cluster. Approximately seventy-one clusters in each arm (equating to 2422 total participants) will enable us to identify a clinically significant mean (0.07) 7% increase in health-related quality of life (from 0.59 [59%] to 0.66 [66%]) with 90% power. This minimum clinically important difference was determined through review of EQ-5D-5L studies that showed a change in overall utility of between 0.03 and 0.07 across a range of chronic conditions was associated with meaningful and observable improvements in QOL. This minimum effect of 0.07 was considered feasible and is supported by an observational study in New South Wales (NSW) that demonstrated improvement in EQ-5D-5L utility of 0.11 could be achieved with a focus on symptom management (internal publication). The power calculation is based on a two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test with alpha=0.05 and assumes a modest intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1 and a design effect of 3.5 (to account for clustering, allowing for uneven cluster sizes) creating an effective sample size of 692. We assume a standard deviation (SD) of the change between baseline and 12 months of 0.281. The 7% represents a conservative estimate in effect however one which demonstrates a clinically meaningful improvement in QOL and translates to a societal benefit of 640 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per year.</p>

                <p id="Par43">Contact details of all potential dialysis centres have been sourced from the ANZDATA registry. Centres are invited via email to complete a pre-trial feasibility survey, exploring existing PROMs use and symptom management strategies. Eligible centres that agree to participate will be randomised. All patients attending that site over a 2-week period are invited to participate in the trial. New patients who may be in their first year of dialysis and who are not yet registered with the ANZDATA registry can be added to the Registry (and trial) before the baseline data collection commences. The ANZDATA Registry operates under an “opt out” model of consent; therefore, if a patient is in a participating centre and chooses not to be a part of the Registry, they are not able to join the trial as secondary outcomes will not be able to be collected for them.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Each patient will be provided with a Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and the opportunity to read the document and ask questions. The PIS was prepared with input from an ANZDATA consumer representative, Mr Shyamsundar Muthuramalingam (SM), and trialled by patients in the Royal Adelaide Hospital haemodialysis unit. Both the PIS and the PIS summary have been translated into the seven language translations used for SWIFT and are presented to patients in the unit. A screening log records any patients who decline participation in SWIFT and representativeness of the included sample will be reported. At the participant’s next dialysis session (at least 2 days later), the participant is asked to complete the online survey(s) specific to their trial allocation (intervention or control). The consent form is embedded into the baseline survey of the trial and will be completed electronically. Participants in both groups will be informed to raise any health concerns with their doctor or nurse.</p>

Centres (clusters) may consist of more than one site if frequent patient movement or otherwise close institutional linkages between sites prohibit distinction into multiple functionally distinct clusters. The randomisation will be stratified based upon location (state), metropolitan or regional, private or public unit or prior or current use of the IPOS-Renal questionnaire for symptom monitoring within each centre and cluster size.

                  <p id="Par62">Data from this trial will be monitored by the Clinical Trials Program staff from the NHMRC CTC and ANZDATA (SWIFT team). Monitoring will include centralised review of electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and other trial documents for protocol compliance, data accuracy and completeness. Monitoring may include monitoring visits to investigational sites during the trial for source data verification and review of the investigator’s site file. The delegated staff will be given direct access to source documents, eCRFs and other trial-related documents. As detailed in the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form, the participant gives authorised staff direct access to their medical records and the trial data. SWIFT is a low-risk trial with no drug or device being tested, therefore a specific, formal data monitoring committee is not required.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par67">SWIFT is the first registry-based trial in the Australian haemodialysis population investigating whether regular symptom monitoring with feedback to participants and clinicians assists in improving QOL. This is significant because people receiving haemodialysis experience a multitude of symptoms related to their treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which in turn is associated with poorer quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par68">We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of this study confirming that 72% of Australian and New Zealand haemodialysis centres indicated that they wished to participate in SWIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This high rate of participation is likely to be associated with recognition of the importance of PROMs and ability of a registry-based trial to be inclusive of all centres regardless of whether they are a small rural facility, a large metropolitan hospital or a private dialysis centre.</p>
              <p id="Par69">The significance of SWIFT as an ANZDATA Registry embedded trial will facilitate the registry to expand on the outcomes collected to include PROMs if the trial determines this to be beneficial. This will complement haemodialysis services that currently have existing infrastructure of regional, national and international registries for collecting and reporting information on all patients receiving treatment (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par70">A limitation of SWIFT is the dependence on the clinician engagement with both participants receiving haemodialysis, and other health care professionals, such as dietitians, social workers and pharmacists once the symptom feedback is delivered to the nurse unit manager and nephrologist. Additionally, patients in the intervention arm who do not have access to email may not be able to access the feedback. Feedback emails can be sent to the email address of a nominated family member or friend or be sent to the generic email of the centre where it can be printed for the patients. In the centres where emails can be sent and oriented in the centre, this adds extra time involvement to an already busy centre. Not all patients will have access to these options which could make it harder to obtain the feedback. The major strength of this trial is the ability to report PROMs alongside standard clinical and biochemical measures in a clinical quality registry. Secondly, trials often are exclusive of non-English participants; therefore, another strength of this trial is that materials have been translated in to 7 languages other than English. This will ensure the trial’s ability to include a broader number of participants and thus ensure better representation of some of Australia’s diverse cultures.</p>
              <p id="Par71">By measuring and determining the effect of collecting and the feeding back of PROMs, SWIFT will draw attention and raise awareness of symptom burden and quality of life, which should drive research and quality improvement efforts in this area. Additionally, SWIFT will increase PROMs as a priority for service investment and improvement with the ultimate aim of measuring what is important to the people that matter—those living with kidney failure.</p>
