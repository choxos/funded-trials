                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Low cardiorespiratory fitness is an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and interventions that increase fitness reduce risk. Water-walking decreases musculoskeletal impact and risk of falls in older individuals, but it is unclear whether water-walking improves aerobic fitness in the same way as weight-dependent land-walking. This randomized controlled trial involved 3 intervention groups—a no-exercise control group (CG), a land-walking (LW) group, and a water-walking (WW) group—to investigate the comparative impacts of LW and WW to CG on fitness.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Both exercise groups attended individually tailored, center-based, intensity-matched 3 × weekly sessions for 24 weeks, which progressed to 150 min of exercise per week. This was followed by a 24-week no-intervention period. Maximal graded exercise tests were performed on a treadmill at Weeks 0, 24, and 48.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Maximal oxygen uptake increased from Week 0 to Week 24 in both exercise groups (0.57 ± 0.62 mL/kg/min, 0.03 ± 0.04 L/min for LW; 0.93 ± 0.75 mL/kg/min, 0.06 ± 0.06 L/min for WW, mean ± SE) compared to the CG (–1.75 ± 0.78 mL/kg/min, –0.16 ± 0.05 L/min) (group × time, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Time to exhaustion increased significantly following LW only (123.4 ± 25.5 s), which was significantly greater (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) than the CG (24.3 ± 18.5 s). By Week 48, the training-induced adaptations in the exercise groups returned to near baseline levels.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Our study supports current physical-activity recommendations that 150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise produces improvements in fitness in previously sedentary older individuals. Also, LW and WW elicit similar improvements in fitness if conducted at the same relative intensities. Exercise-naïve older individuals can benefit from the lower impact forces and decreased risk of falls associated with WW without compromising improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness.</p>

              <p id="para0005">Low cardiorespiratory fitness is a potent independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in apparently healthy individuals and those with established cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The optimal measure of cardiorespiratory fitness is maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>), the integrative capacity to transport and utilize O<sub>2</sub> for the provision of cellular energy, usually determined in response to a graded exercise test (GXT). An increase in VO<sub>2max</sub> of 3.5 mL/kg/min (1 metabolic equivalent) translates to a 13% decrease in all-cause mortality and a 15% reduction in mortality due to cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para0006">Historically, exercise science research has focused on the impact of interventions involving bouts of large-muscle-group dynamic exercise such as walking, running, and cycling,<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> the outcomes of which have driven health guideline development such as the recommendation that individuals accrue 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) per week.<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Such studies have also fostered the notion that a dose-response relationship exists between the intensity (or volume) of exercise undertaken and the consequent fitness gain.<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> At the same time, an appropriate clinical exercise prescription recognizes individual differences in the capability to undertake exercise, with improved adherence and adaptation in older individuals resulting from exercise that is progressively titrated to avoid musculoskeletal injury and cardiovascular risk.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In essence, an optimal exercise prescription in older individuals maximizes the beneficial adaptation whilst minimizing potential risk.</p>
              <p id="para0007">Water-based exercise performed in the upright posture is often used for older populations<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and those at elevated injury risk,<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> recognizing the decreased gravitational forces and musculoskeletal impact on bone and soft tissue structures.<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> To date, the majority of water-based exercise training interventions have focused on water-aerobics, which involve a range of distinct movement patterns, sometimes with the inclusion of some resistance exercises, and usually performed whilst stationary.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In contrast, walking in water (WW) is associated with drag force and resistance and induces distinct gait patterns comparable to land walking (LW) (i.e., shorter stride length, slower walking speed, and smaller range of motion in the knees), particularly in older individuals.<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We recently reported changes in body composition favoring increased lower limb lean body mass as a consequence of WW compared to LW, suggesting that the greater resistance during WW could be responsible for muscle mass adaptations that are at least as beneficial as LW, if not more so.<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> This is of particular importance for older adults vulnerable to age-related muscle wasting;<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and WW also provides some benefit in terms of reduced skeletal loading and joint stress,<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> in addition to reducing potential injury as a result of falls. However, to our knowledge, a direct comparison of the impact of LW <italic>vs.</italic> WW conducted at the same relative intensity (% heart rate reserve (HRR)) over a 6-month intervention period concerning cardiorespiratory fitness has not previously been undertaken in older adults. We, therefore, designed a randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of a 24-week supervised, monitored, and center-based LW or WW intervention in previously sedentary older participants, followed by an additional 24-week no-intervention period for all groups. Maximal cardiorespiratory fitness was measured at Weeks 0, 24, and 48. We hypothesized that both forms of exercise would enhance aerobic capacity relative to a nonintervention control group (Week 0 <italic>vs.</italic> Week 24) and that the adaptation would be reversed following cessation of exercise (Week 24 <italic>vs.</italic> Week 48).</p>

              <p id="para0009">A variety of recruitment strategies, including flyers and advertisements in local newspapers and on local radio broadcasts, was utilized to encourage community-dwelling individuals aged 50 years and over (females must have been post-menopausal) to contact the research team for study details. An initial phone screening session by questionnaire was conducted to ascertain whether potential participants met the predetermined inclusion criteria.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> These inclusion criteria required individuals to be relatively physically inactive (less than 60 min/week of purposeful physical activity); nonsmokers (&gt; 12 months); alcohol intake lower than 280 g/week (and/or drinking &lt; 40 g ethanol in 1 session); no injuries or illnesses that would prohibit participation in exercise; no current or previous disease, such as cardiovascular disease, inclusive of diabetes, heart attack, or stroke; and no associated medical procedures such as stenting. The use of medications such as beta-blockers, blood pressure drugs, or lipid-lowering drugs were permitted, provided that they had been taken regularly for at least 6 months prior to entering the study. Individuals meeting these criteria attended the university laboratory to undergo a physical examination to further determine suitability for inclusion in the study. This included height and body mass (body mass index &lt; 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), resting blood pressure (systolic blood press &lt; 160 mmHg, diastolic blood press &lt; 100 mmHg), fasting blood tests (total cholesterol &lt; 7.0 mmol/L), and urea and creatinine to rule out the presence of abnormal kidney function (&lt;11 mmol/L in men and &lt;9 mmol/L in women). Individuals satisfying all of these criteria were entered into the study and attended a session that familiarized them with the fitness-testing equipment and treadmill walking.</p>
              <p id="para0010">As part of the study, all participants took part in a maximal exercise test on a treadmill at 3 time points: Week 0 (baseline), after Week 24 (immediately post-intervention), and after Week 48 (24 weeks post-intervention). Following the baseline test at Week 0, participants were randomized to one of 3 groups for interventions that were 24 weeks in duration: LW, WW, or control group (CG). Participants in the CG were asked to maintain their usual level of physical activity and daily living habits across the 24 weeks. Following the initial 24-week intervention period and repeated GXT, participants in all groups were thanked for their involvement and had no contact with the university or researchers for an additional 24 weeks (Weeks 24–48). Participants were provided with no deliberate instruction to either continue or desist from exercise.</p>

Mean HR over the exercise session was used to determine the intensity (%HRR) achieved for each individual at every session. Participants were given the opportunity to make up any missed sessions in order to maximize adherence by attending extra sessions in the following 2 weeks of exercise. Apart from the addition of the exercise sessions as part of the intervention, the LW and WW groups were asked to maintain their usual lifestyle behaviors throughout the study. After the 24-week exercise intervention and subsequent assessments, the study continued for an additional 24-week period. During this phase, the LW and WW groups were free to exercise or not, of their own volition.</p>

This measurement was included to determine whether our results were caused by the intervention or whether changes in daily physical activity may have been a contributing factor. Participants were instructed to wear the device during waking hours, but the devices were removed during participation in the exercise sessions that were part of the intervention. Monitors were worn at Weeks 0, 24, and 48 to determine whether any changes in lifestyle physical activity occurred around the prescribed center-based activities. Participants were also asked to complete a continuous 8-day diary at each time point to record hours of wear. Data were downloaded using ActiLife software (Version 6.13.1; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA), and a member of the research team, who was blinded to group allocation, processed the data using a customized Excel macro (Version 2013; Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA, USA). Nonwear time was defined as 60 min of consecutive zeros. Freedson adult cut-points were used to quantify time spent in light-intensity physical activity (LPA), moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA), and vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA) per day.

Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Unadjusted means, SDs, and confidence intervals were calculated for the fitness outcome variables at Weeks 0, 24, and 48. Due to the correlated and repeated-measure nature of the data, separate linear mixed models were used to investigate the relationship between the fitness variables (VO<sub>2</sub> data at max, treadmill time to exhaustion, and peak HR), groups (CG, LW, and WW), and time (baseline and Week 24) using 2-tailed tests. These analyses accounted for time invariant covariates, including age and sex, and an interaction between group and time. A random intercept was included in each model to account for the repeated nature of the data. These analyses were repeated to test the maintenance of the intervention (Week 24 to Week 48). Analyses were also conducted with daily physical activity data by Actigraph (LPA, MPA, MVPA, and VPA) because these outcomes would examine whether any changes in fitness might be attributable to changes in habitual and incidental physical activity.

              <p id="para0027">Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related mortality, and increases in fitness are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The aim of the current study was to investigate the impacts of walking exercise, conducted either in water (WW) or on land (LW) at identical relative HR-based intensities, on aerobic fitness. We found that VO<sub>2max</sub> improved following both of the 24-week, supervised, and center-based walking interventions, compared to a no-exercise CG. The volume of exercise undertaken was intentionally prescribed to meet current exercise guidelines.<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Our investigation supports these recommendations because improvements in fitness were observed in our previously sedentary cohort. Our study also indicates that walking on land or in water elicits similar improvements in aerobic fitness if conducted at the same relative intensities. This may be particularly relevant for individuals who are older and/or new to exercise, given that these participants may benefit from the lower impact forces associated with WW. Our findings also suggest that these modalities could potentially be used independently, or interchangeably, to induce similar cardiovascular adaptations.</p>
              <p id="para0028">Recent reviews indicate that the majority of previous water-based exercise studies are of relatively short duration (e.g., 8 weeks) and have included a variety of exercises performed in water as opposed to WW, which is directly comparable to LW.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Some studies involving water-based exercise did not assess changes in cardiorespiratory fitness<xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> or did not include a comparison to a land-based exercise group.<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> In 1 study, 8 weeks of interval running in water whilst wearing a buoyancy vest increased maximal exercise performance measured on a bicycle ergometer in older women, but land-based exercise was not included in the study.<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Treadmill walking in water and on land for 12 weeks improved aerobic fitness similarly in middle-aged obese adults,<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> and we confirm these findings in our longer study in an older cohort. It is pertinent that stationary WW (i.e., treadmill in water or aqua aerobics) may have distinct effects compared to walking forward against water resistance, although some effort has been made to address this issue through the use of resistance jets.<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> A study involving older women found that 12 weeks of LW for 60 min, 5 times/week increased VO<sub>2max</sub>, but 60 min of water-based exercise, including aerobic and resistance-based movements 3 times/week, induced additional improvements in fitness.<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The apparent superior results from water-based exercise in the latter study<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> may be due to differences in the frequency and/or modality of exercise between the land and water groups, as opposed to the influence of the exercise being performed in water or on land. We have previously shown that, at matched HRs, there is a similar oxygen cost during WW relative to LW,<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and this supports our approach in the present study to using HR to prescribe and match exercise intensity. Our study is novel and translatable to the general public, in that we included only WW, as opposed to treadmill WW, which has been previously utilized in other studies reported in the scientific literature.<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Our results suggest that, although there are distinctions between LW and WW, aerobic fitness improvements can occur in inactive older adults with both forms of training, and both forms preserve functional capacity compared to doing no level of exercise training.</p>
              <p id="para0029">An interesting aspect of the fitness adaptation to LW and WW in the present study relates to the changes observed in the LW group <italic>vs.</italic> the WW group in time to exhaustion and VO<sub>2max</sub>. The LW group increased exercise duration by an average of 50 s more than the WW group, whereas the larger improvement in VO<sub>2max</sub> was evident in the WW group. This apparent discrepancy may be due to the specificity of training on land. Walking efficiency may have improved in the LW group, reflected by the enhanced time to exhaustion, whereas the VO<sub>2max</sub> gains were not different and, indeed, tended to be larger in the WW group.<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The trend for enhanced VO<sub>2max</sub> in WW compared to LW may, in turn, reflect the larger impact of the WW modality on lower limb lean body mass (i.e., skeletal muscle mass). In fact, in our recent companion paper pertaining to the body composition impacts of this study, we observed greater increases in lean mass of the lower limbs following WW compared to both LW and CG.<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Indeed, WW may represent a form of combined aerobic and resistance exercise. In this regard, the benefits of WW in older exercise-naive individuals may exceed those associated with land-based training, notwithstanding the apparent weight support of exercising in the water.</p>
              <p id="para0030">It may be expected that the improvements in aerobic fitness in response to engagement in 3 bouts of 50 min of walking per week (150 min/week) would be associated with more substantive fitness gain than we observed. The intensity of exercise conducted by participants was approximately 55%–65% HRR and is, therefore, considered to be of moderate intensity.<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Moderate-intensity exercise is associated with better compliance compared to vigorous exercise,<xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and our findings indicate that moderate-intensity exercise is capable of having some positive impact on fitness. A larger benefit in this older cohort might have been observed if the training had continued in the longer term. There is a well-established dose-response curve relating exercise volume to health and fitness benefits,<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and a volume of exercise that exceeded the minimum recommendation for exercise would, therefore, likely incur additional benefit.<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> We chose our exercise interventions carefully to represent those recommended in current guidelines, and our aim was to compare the impacts of distinct modalities (WW <italic>vs.</italic> LW) when both were matched. Although it may appear that the benefits in the 2 exercise groups were relatively modest in absolute terms, it is important to emphasize that, on average, the net difference between the changes we observed in the 2 intervention groups (LW and WW) and the CG was ∼2.5–3 mL/kg/min, which translates to an approximately 13% reduction in cardiovascular mortality.<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para0031">Our study design allows some inference to be drawn regarding the maintenance of exercise-training effects. Across the 24- to 48-week time period, participants were no longer in contact with the study staff and no longer attended the supervised exercise sessions. No specific direction was given to the participants in relation to this follow-up stage; they were free to exercise or not. It was of interest to see whether these formerly inactive participants maintained the change in activity levels associated with the supervised training interventions, particularly as we observed excellent adherence during the interventional phase. However, the fitness adaptations measured at Week 24 were completely reversed following the subsequent 24-week no-intervention period (Week 48). This reversal strongly supports the causal link between our exercise interventions and the fitness changes we observed between Week 0 and Week 24. It also confirms that exercise must be continued to maintain fitness levels and, by extension, health benefits. Interestingly, the objective physical activity data we collected suggested that there were no systematic changes in free-living physical activity over the intervention and postintervention phases of the study. Hence, the decreases in fitness we observed between Week 24 and Week 48 were likely due to cessation of the exercise interventions <italic>per se</italic>, with no evidence for systematic alteration or carry-over of volitional exercise. These data suggest that the maintenance of benefits associated with fitness gain requires ongoing exposure to the stimulus of exercise.</p>
              <p id="para0032">A strength of this study was that it included supervised, center-based exercise training tailored for each individual based on HRR, which ensures strict adherence to the intervention and documentation of nonadherence. A potential limitation of this study is that we focused only on the impact of exercise and did not assess other factors such as diet that may have changed during the intervention. This limitation is mitigated, to some degree, by the fact that participants were randomized to 2 exercise interventions and CG, which assumes some similarity in the nonexercise behaviors. Our study supports existing data showing that adherence to exercise is greater when conducted in a group setting and progresses gradually to support exercise self-efficacy.<xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Future research might incorporate psychological methods for promoting behavior change and exercise adherence. Our study included the minimum dose of exercise recommended to induce some health benefit,<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> but a greater volume of exercise, achieved by a higher frequency, intensity or duration, may have resulted in more pronounced adaptations in the exercise groups, and this may be the subject of future investigations. Due to the nature of the exercise interventions, it was not possible for the exercise physiologists to be blinded to group allocation during the time of the intervention, and this may also be a limitation of the study. However, each participant was provided with a de-identifying code, so that the person subsequently collating, processing, and analyzing the data output from the GXT indirect calorimetry output file was blinded to group allocation, eliminating bias in the analysis. We arranged for the CG participants to attend seminars once every 6 weeks (a strength of the study), but this did not equal the number of exercise sessions undertaken by the 2 exercise groups, so this discrepancy in contact hours may represent a limitation in our methodology.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="para0033">In summary, we found that 24 weeks of walking increases aerobic capacity, a strong predictor of overall health, compared to remaining inactive. The adaptations were similar regardless of whether walking was conducted in water or on land. Because fitness returned to baseline levels following a subsequent 6-month nonintervention period, it is important that exercise adherence be maintained if the positive adaptations derived from exercise are to be preserved. This study has particular implications for the elderly and for those who may benefit from low-impact musculoskeletal exercise. Older individuals who are not regular exercisers can benefit from the lower impact forces and decreased risk from falls associated with WW, without compromising improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness.</p>
