                <title>7. Background and rationale for trial</title>
                <p id="Par28">Endotracheal intubation is an essential but potentially destabilising procedure for neonates. With an increased focus on avoiding mechanical ventilation, particularly in preterm infants, there are fewer opportunities for clinicians to gain proficiency in this important emergency skill. Rates of successful intubation at the first attempt are relatively low, and adverse event rates including desaturation and bradycardia are high, when compared with intubations in paediatric and adult populations. Interventions to improve operator success and patient stability during neonatal endotracheal intubation are needed. Using nasal high flow therapy during apnoea extends the safe apnoeica time of adults undergoing upper airway surgery and during endotracheal intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This technique is untested in neonates.</p>
                <p id="Par29">The SHINE (Stabilisation with nasal High flow during Intubation of NEonates) trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing the use of nasal high flow (nHF) during neonatal intubation with standard care (no nHF). Intubations are randomised individually and stratified by site, use of premedications, and postmenstrual age of the infant (≤ 28 weeks’ gestation; &gt; 28 weeks’ gestation). The primary outcome is the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability of the infant. Physiological instability is defined as an absolute decrease in peripheral oxygen saturation &gt; 20% from pre-intubation baseline and/or bradycardia (&lt; 100 beats per minute).</p>

                  <p id="Par30">In neonates undergoing emergent or elective (with premedication) endotracheal intubation, does the use of nHF during laryngoscopy increase the likelihood of successful intubation on the first attempt without physiological instability, compared with no nHF?</p>

                <p id="Par31">The primary objective of the SHINE trial is to investigate the efficacy of nHF in improving first attempt intubation success without physiological instability in neonates.</p>

                <title>9. Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par32">The SHINE trial is a multicentre, unblinded, randomised controlled trial investigating the efficacy of nHF to improve success and stability during neonatal endotracheal intubation. Intubations performed in the delivery room (DR) or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) will be randomised, with a 1:1 ratio.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Infants will receive either:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par34">Nasal HF during the endotracheal intubation attempt, or</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Standard care (no nHF during the endotracheal intubation attempt)</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par36">Full explanation of the trial design is included in the trial protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Study protocol development and conduct</title>
                  <p id="Par37">The SHINE trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN126128001498280) on 6 September 2018. The trial was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of The Royal Women’s Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) on 8 November 2018 and by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Monash Health (Melbourne, Australia) on 1 March 2019.</p>
                  <p id="Par38">The consent process involves written, prospective consent wherever possible from parents for inclusion of their infant in the study. However, in the event of an emergency intubation in the DR or within the first 24 h after admission to NICU, the study has approval to use a retrospective consent process at both study sites. The infant will be included in the study, then consent to continue (retrospective consent) will be sought from the parent or guardian as soon as possible after the procedure. This consent process was pursued due to the known safety and efficacy of nHF use in neonates and the lack of any anticipated risk compared with standard clinical practice.</p>
                  <p id="Par39">An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) is monitoring the study progress. The trial will be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

                <title>10. Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par42">Each intubation episode is randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either nHF or control, stratified by:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par43">Centre (Royal Women’s Hospital or Monash Newborn),</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Postmenstrual age (≤ 28 weeks' gestation; &gt; 28 weeks' gestation)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Use of premedication for intubation.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par46">The randomisation sequence uses random permuted blocks with varying block sizes. To enable rapid randomisation following the decision to intubate by the clinical team, the randomisation is performed at the cot-side using a smartphone or computer with online access to the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] randomisation tool. Randomisation is web-based, using a password-protected, secure sockets layer (SSL)-encrypted website. The randomisation sequence was developed by an independent statistician at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia. The group allocations are unblinded, due to the nature of the intervention. Intubation episodes, rather than infants, are randomised. An infant who has previously had an intubation episode randomised within the study can have subsequent intubation episodes randomised if (1) the premedication randomisation stratum differs between the studied intubations or (2) there is at least 1 week between the studied intubations for intubations where premedications are used.</p>

                <title>11. Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par47">The sample size of 246 intubation episodes is based on a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which examined 206 neonatal intubations by junior medical staff. This study found a 29% successful intubation rate at the first attempt without peripheral oxygen desaturation &gt; 20% or bradycardia &lt; 100 beats per minute. With a power of 90% to detect an increase in the incidence of successful intubation without physiological instability from 30 to 50%, and two-sided alpha 0.05, at least 123 intubation episodes in each group (246 total) are required.</p>

                <title>13. Statistical interim analysis and stopping guidance</title>
                <p id="Par50">An external DSMB has been convened and is chaired by Dr Chris McKinlay (Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, New Zealand). The DSMB consists of two consultant neonatologists (Dr Chris McKinlay and Dr Peter Dargaville) and an independent statistician (Dr Myra McGuinness). The terms of reference of the DSMB were outlined in the SHINE trial DSMB charter (version 4, 25 June 2019) and ratified by the Trial Steering Committee and all members of the DSMB during the first DSMB meeting.</p>
                <p id="Par51">Safety analyses, including of pre-defined significant adverse events (SAEs), were planned and performed after recruitment of:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par52">60 patients (~ 25% total)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">125 patients (~ 50% total) and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">180 patients (~ 75% total).</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par55">The defined SAEs were:

                <p id="Par59">After 125 patients were recruited (~ 50% total), an interim efficacy analysis was undertaken, comparing the two treatment groups (blinded) for the primary endpoint and its components:

                <p id="Par64">The information was presented by pseudo-labelled treatment arm (e.g. ‘A’ and ‘B’); the key to identify the treatment arms was able to be supplied by the independent statistician if requested by the DSMB.</p>
                <p id="Par65">As per the DSMB charter, the DSMB could recommend stopping the trial on the basis of <italic>safety</italic> using clinical judgement informed by statistical comparison of adverse event rates. Accumulating signals of harm did not necessarily require statistically significant differences to warrant an alert and recommendation from the DSMB. The DSMB were also able to consider recommending stopping the trial if there was a very strong statistically significant difference (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) in the primary outcome between groups at the interim efficacy analysis. There was no planned adjustment of the significance level due to interim analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par66">At each time-point, the DSMB recommended continuation of the trial, with an unchanged protocol.</p>

Each intubation episode is video recorded using a GoPro camera (GoPro, San Mateo, California), placed in a location that provides a clear overhead view of the intubation procedure, the infant’s face and the Masimo (Irvine, CA, USA) pulse oximeter. Each video recording is reviewed by an investigator to determine primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome is also recorded on the Case Report Form in real time, in case of video failure. Outcomes are then entered into an secure, password-protected, online electronic database (REDCap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]) by an investigator at each hospital.</p>

                <p id="Par78">On October 29, 2020, the Trial Steering Committee sought advice from the independent DSMB regarding post-randomisation exclusion criteria, with three deidentified randomisation episodes presented for discussion. These DSMB were blinded to trial data regarding the treatment arm and outcomes of the infants discussed.</p>
                <p id="Par79">Based on advice from the DSMB, the Trial Steering Committee reached consensus agreement regarding the following criteria for post-randomisation exclusions on 19 February 2021.

                <title>27. Analysis methods</title>
                <p id="Par128">For all outcomes, the difference between the 2 treatment groups will be estimated using multivariable regression, with the outcome as the dependent variable, the group allocation as the predictor, and the stratification factors used during randomisation (gestational age group, premedication use and trial centre) as covariates.</p>
                <p id="Par129">For binary outcome variables, including the primary outcome, the number and percentage of intubation attempts with the outcome will be presented separately for the 2 treatment groups. Binary regression (fitting a generalised linear model) will be used to estimate the difference between the treatment groups. The results will be reported as the difference in risk between the 2 treatment groups, with the 95% CI for the risk difference.</p>
                <p id="Par130">For continuous outcomes, the distribution of each outcome will be assessed visually using graphical methods (histogram and dotplot). If the distribution is considered to be so skewed that the mean is an inappropriate summary measure, the outcome will be summarised using the median, otherwise the outcome will be summarised by the mean.</p>
                <p id="Par131">Where the summary measure is the mean, the mean and SD will be presented separately for the 2 treatment groups. Linear regression will be used to estimate the difference between the treatment groups. The results will be reported as the difference of means between the 2 treatment groups, with the 95% CI for the difference of means.</p>
                <p id="Par132">Where the summary measure is the median, the median and IQR will be presented separately for the 2 treatment groups. Quantile regression will be used to estimate the difference between the treatment groups. The results will be reported as the difference of medians between the 2 treatment groups, with the 95% CI for the difference of medians.</p>

                  <p id="Par133">The primary analysis will be a modified intention to treat analysis, using the exclusion criteria outlined above. The primary outcome is a binary outcome, so as described above, the number and percentage of intubation attempts where there was successful intubation at the first attempt without physiological instability will be presented separately for the 2 treatment groups. Binary regression (a generalised linear multivariable model, with the primary outcome as the dependent variable, the group allocation as the predictor, and the stratification factors used during randomisation as covariates) will be used to estimate the difference between the treatment groups. The results will be reported as the difference in risk between the 2 treatment groups, with the 95% CI for the risk difference.</p>

                  <p id="Par134">As some infants will be randomised more than once, the difference in risk of the primary outcome between the 2 treatment groups, with the 95% CI for the risk difference, adjusted for repeated measures, will also be reported. The model used for this analysis will be a multivariable binary regression as described above, with standard errors estimated allowing for intragroup correlation (using the vce(cluster) option in Stata).</p>
                  <p id="Par135">If an imbalance in demographics known to affect intubation success (e.g. postmenstrual age, weight, videolaryngoscope use, operator experience) is detected, a further sensitivity analysis adjusting for the relevant demographics will be conducted for the primary outcome.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome—subgroup analyses</title>
                  <p id="Par136">We will perform pre-specified subgroup analyses for the primary outcome. The prespecified subgroup analyses included in the protocol are:

                  <p id="Par145">As the study is not powered for subgroup analysis, these analyses are considered exploratory. Three additional adjusted models will be estimated to explore potential heterogeneity of the effect of the intervention. Each model will include as covariates the stratification factors used in randomisation and an interaction term estimating the interaction between the intervention and the subgroup variable (listed above). Specific subgroup estimates and confidence intervals will be presented obtained from the adjusted model. If there is no evidence of interaction (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), any differences between subgroups will be regarded as due to chance.</p>

The primary outcome is recorded on a paper CRF by the investigator at the cot-side, to provide a backup to the video recording and time stamped downloadable oximetry recording. We therefore expect there to be very few instances in which the primary outcome cannot be determined and therefore do not anticipate needing to use multiple imputation to deal with missing data. Imputation will not be used for missing physiological data, for example in the event of loss of pulse oximetry signal or failure of video recording.</p>
