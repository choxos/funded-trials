                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Depression is highly prevalent and the leading contributor to the burden of disease in young people worldwide, making it an ongoing priority for early intervention. As the current evidence-based interventions of medication and psychological therapy are only modestly effective, there is an urgent need for additional treatment strategies. This paper describes the rationale of the Improving Mood with Physical ACTivity (IMPACT) trial. The primary aim of the IMPACT trial is to determine the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention compared with psychoeducation, in addition to routine clinical care, on depressive symptoms in young people. Additional aims are to evaluate the intervention effects on anxiety and functional outcomes and examine whether changes in physical activity mediate improvements in depressive symptoms.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The study is being conducted in six youth mental health services across Australia and is using a parallel-group, two-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial design, with randomisation occurring at the clinician level. Participants aged between 12 years and 25 years with moderate to severe levels of depression are randomised to receive, in addition to routine clinical care, either: (1) a physical activity behaviour change intervention or (2) psychoeducation about physical activity. The primary outcome will be change in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, with assessments occurring at baseline, postintervention (end-point) and 6-month follow-up from end-point. Secondary outcome measures will address additional clinical outcomes, functioning and quality of life. IMPACT is to be conducted between May 2014 and December 2019.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Depression is highly prevalent<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and is the leading cause of disability in young people worldwide.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Associated adverse consequences include impairments in academic attainment and achievement,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> unemployment or underemployment,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and increased risk of self-harm and suicide.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Effective treatments have the potential to improve the health and functioning of young people and prevent the entrenchment of problems with relationships, education and health.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The current international evidence-based clinical practice guideline for treating depression in children and young people recommends cognitiveâ€“behavioural therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment for moderate to severe depression, with or without the antidepressant medication, fluoxetine.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Recent evidence from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the effect sizes of both CBT and antidepressant medication are smaller than previously reported.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7â€“9</xref> This suggests that many young people either fail to respond or do not show a clinically significant change even after receiving the best available guideline-recommended treatment delivered in controlled trials.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10</xref>
</p>
              <p>With such modest effects of first-line treatments, there is a need for additional therapeutic strategies. One such strategy with an emerging evidence base is exercise or physical activity as an augmentation or adjunct treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Large cross-sectional and cohort studies show that less physically active young people are currently more likely to be depressed and are at greater risk of developing future depression.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> While insufficient physical activity places all young people at greater risk of poor physical health, including higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and premature death,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> young people with depression are far more likely to be physically inactive than the general population, placing them at higher risk of long-term poorer physical health.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> In addition to mental and physical health benefits, physical activity is a low-stigma intervention that has few side effects.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Both of these factors are important to help-seeking young people.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
              <p>There is strong evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses that physical activity is an effective intervention for depression in adults (standard mean difference (SMD)=1.135, p&lt;0.001)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and reduces the risk of suicidal ideation.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although not as robust as the evidence base for adults,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> physical activity interventions for young people with depression show similar findings.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23â€“25</xref> A recent meta-analysis, conducted by members of our investigator team, of RCTs in young people aged 12â€“25 years established that physical activity is effective in reducing depression symptoms.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Data from 771 participants across 16 trials showed a large effect of supervised physical activity interventions on depression symptoms compared with controls in subthreshold samples (SMD=âˆ’0.82, p&lt;0.01). The effect remained robust in five trials of young people with a diagnosis of depression (SMD=âˆ’0.72, p&lt;0.01). However, clinical applications are hindered by the majority of studies being of low quality, lack of longer term follow-up and inadequate consideration of real-world implementation factors.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p>
              <p>Our group developed an intervention and evaluated it in the first RCT examining the potential benefits of low-intensity, simple psychological and unsupervised physical activity interventions for young people (n=176) with high prevalence mental health problems,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> implemented within community-based youth mental health services. Conducted in two such services in the western region of Melbourne, Australia, the trial used a factorial design to compare the effects of a psychological intervention (problem solving therapy vs supportive counselling) and a physical activity intervention (behavioural change vs psychoeducation) delivered in up six sessions (an average of 4.3 sessions were completed). Importantly, we recruited men and women, making this the first physical activity study to be conducted with young men with depression or anxiety symptoms. The physical activity intervention focused on addressing barriers to engaging in physical activity and creating individualised activity plans. Postintervention data showed the main effect of the physical activity intervention was significant when compared with the control condition (psychoeducation), resulting in a clinically meaningful reduction in depression symptoms with a medium effect size (<italic>d</italic>=0.41; (95% CI 0.07 to 0.76)), measured by the Beck Depression Inventory.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Those in the physical activity intervention group reported the greatest improvement regardless of the type of psychological intervention received.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, it is important to note that the physical activity intervention was delivered in conjunction with manualised psychological therapies by research therapists rather than as part of routine clinical care.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Study rationale</title>
                <p>Current first-line treatments for depression in young people are, at best, modestly effective. Augmentation with an additional intervention such as physical activity is a strong candidate to improve response to treatment. The results from our earlier study indicate that physical activity in combination with psychological treatment is effective in reducing depression symptoms in young people.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, as clinicians do not routinely include physical activity interventions in standard care,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the opportunity to improve depression and functional outcomes and prevent poor physical health for young people with depression may be missed.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 28</xref> This lack of integration likely occurs because clinicians are not aware of the evidence, are unsure how to implement physical activity interventions or lack the time and resources.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> By providing training and clinical resources, the objective of the current study is to determine the effectiveness of a physical activity behaviour change intervention when used as an adjunct to routine clinical care, delivered in real-world mental health contexts.</p>

                <p>The aims of this study are to test the effectiveness of a physical activity behaviour change intervention, compared with psychoeducation about physical activity, in addition to routine clinical care in improving depressive symptoms (primary outcome) in young help-seekers with depression. Secondary outcomes include the effect of the intervention on anxiety symptoms and functioning and to examine whether changes in physical activity mediate improvements in depressive symptoms.</p>

                  <p>Primary quantitative analyses will be undertaken on an intent-to-treat basis, including all participants as randomised, regardless of treatment received or withdrawal from the study. Linear mixed models will be used to analyse change in the primary outcome measure (QIDS-A17-C). Models will include a random â€˜clinicianâ€™ factor. Correlation of repeated outcome measures will be accommodated using an unstructured varianceâ€“covariance matrix. An a priori planned comparison of change from baseline to the postintervention assessment will be used to test the primary hypothesis. Comparison of change from baseline to follow-up between arms will be undertaken as a secondary outcome analysis. Factors used in assignment by minimisation (clinician gender, discipline and <italic>headspace</italic> centre) will be introduced in models as covariates and retained if significant. Variables associated with participant missingness or found to be substantially inbalanced between groups will be included in models on an exploratory basis.<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
</p>
                  <p>Mathematical transformation or categorisation of raw scores will be undertaken to meet distributional assumptions and address any violation of assumptions required in mixed models. When transformations have been undertaken to better meet distribution assumptions, models using the transformed data will be considered the main test of the primary hypotheses. Mixed models use all available data and do not involve any substitution of missing values with supposed or estimated values. The assumptions underlying mixed modelling allow â€˜missingnessâ€™ to be related to observed variables in the analysis but not to unobserved values (termed â€˜missing at randomâ€™).<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>
</p>
                  <p>Similar analyses of scaled secondary measures will assess differential change due to intervention arm. For dichotomous outcomes such as diagnoses and ordinal or count outcomes, comparable generalised mixed modelling approach will be used. Relative and reduction in risk of depression based on SCID diagnostic status will be estimated at the trial end-point and follow-up. Numbers needed to treat will be derived from these values. All analyses will use two-sided tests, with an alpha value set at 0.05. In the event of substantial missingness, sensitivity analyses based on identified clinically plausible mechanisms may be undertaken to determine the robustness of findings.</p>
                  <p>Qualitative analyses of the semistructured interviews included within the process and implementation measures will be undertaken on audio-recorded interviews that will be transcribed verbatim, with data analysed using thematic analysis.<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>

                <title>Power analysis</title>
                <p>Calculations of required sample size were based on detecting a postintervention effect size of 0.34, which is at the lower boundary of utility and also reflects the adjunctive status of the intervention. Power was set at 0.90, alpha=0.05 (two tailed) and correlation of 0.5 assumed between pretreatment and post-treatment scores. To allow for possible clustering effects (participants with the same therapist having characteristics and outcomes more alike than between therapists), a design effect<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> was calculated assuming an intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.05 and the number of clients per therapist up to 24. The estimate of the ICC is at the upper range of therapist effects and is conservative given the prescribed, manualised nature of the intervention. It is anticipated that 6â€“8 clinicians per <italic>headspace</italic> centre will be involved in the study. The resultant design effect of 2.15 reflects the possible non-independence of cluster-sampled participants and was used to inflate the calculated sample size, which assumes independence. The estimated required sample size was 784. To accommodate a potential attrition/withdrawal rate of up to 20%, the target sample size was set at 960 or 480 participants per condition.</p>

                <title>Safety procedures and oversight</title>
                <p>Each participating <italic>headspace</italic> centre will have a principal site investigator and will also be required to nominate a lead clinician who will be responsible for the oversight of participant safety during the course of the trial. Withdrawal from the study can be at the request of the participant or if the participant meets discontinuation criteria. Once withdrawn, the young person will be reviewed using the <italic>headspace</italic> centreâ€™s standard clinical review procedure and either maintained in the <italic>headspace</italic> centre or referred to other services as necessary. Any <italic>adverse incident</italic>, any serious or unanticipated adverse effects of the research on study participants, and unforeseen events that might affect continued ethical acceptability of the project, will be captured and reported until resolution, stabilisation or the participant is lost to follow-up, unless the condition is unlikely to resolve as per the opinion of the medical practitioner appointed by the study sponsor to monitor adverse incidents. In the event of an adverse incident or unexpected outcome, the allied health professional or research personnel will report to the study sponsor, Orygen. If necessary, a decision will be made as to whether to withdraw or suspend participation. The study sponsor will conduct annual centralised monitoring visits of the study sites.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and are the leading cause of disability in young people worldwide. If effective, the physical activity intervention tested in this C-RCT has the potential to improve the immediate outcomes for young people with depression by providing an additive treatment effect in conjunction with routine clinical care. Additional benefits may include improvements in social and vocational functioning, thereby reducing the likelihood of longer term damage in these domains.</p>
              <p>The IMPACT intervention is easily scalable. As it is set within the national network of <italic>headspace</italic> centres, this will increase the likelihood that any benefits are translated into routine clinical practice for the many thousands of young people who access <italic>headspace</italic> services per annum. There is also potential to adapt the intervention for other service delivery models (eg, primary care and tertiary mental health services) nationally and internationallyâ€”including in regional and remote areasâ€”which may be of interest to policy makers and those funding mental health programmes or services.</p>
