                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Despite widespread use, there are few studies evaluating the consumer Choosing Wisely questions.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We evaluated the impact of the Choosing Wisely questions on consumersâ decision-making outcomes. Adults living in Australia were presented with a hypothetical low-value care scenario. Using a 2Ã2Ã2 between-subjects factorial design, they were randomized to either the Choosing Wisely questions (âQuestionsâ), a shared decision-making (SDM) preparation video (âVideoâ), both interventions, or control (no intervention). Primary outcomes were 1) self-efficacy to ask questions and be involved in decision-making and 2) intention to engage in SDM.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 1,439 participants (45.6% with âinadequateâ health literacy) were eligible and included in the analysis. Intention to engage in SDM was higher in people randomized to the Video (mean difference [MD]â=â0.24 [scale 0â6], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14, 0.35), Questions (MDâ=â0.12, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.22), and both interventions (MDâ=â0.33, 95% CI: 0.23â0.44, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â&lt;â0.001, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>â=â0.28) compared with control. Combining interventions had a greater impact than presenting the Questions alone (MDâ=â0.22, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.32; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â&lt;â0.001). Those who received the Video or both interventions reported lower intention to follow the low-value treatment plan without further questioning (all <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â&lt;â0.05) and more positive attitudes toward SDM (all <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â&lt;â0.05) compared with control. Intervention acceptability was high in all study arms (&gt;80%), but proactive access was low (1.7%â20.8%). Compared with control, participants who received one or both interventions asked more questions that mapped to the Choosing Wisely questions (all <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â&lt;â.001). There were no main effects of either intervention on self-efficacy or knowledge.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The Choosing Wisely questions and a video to promote SDM may improve intention to engage in SDM and support patients in identifying questions that align with the Choosing Wisely campaign (with some additional benefits of the video intervention).</p>

                      <p>There were some additional benefits of the Video intervention in reducing willingness to accept low-value treatment for low-back pain without asking questions; however, neither intervention changed participantsâ self-efficacy to ask questions and be involved in decision-making nor affected perceptions of preparedness to engage in SDM or knowledge of rights to be involved in health care decision-making.</p>

            <p>There is an increasing recognition of the need to reduce unnecessary and low-value medical care and decrease waste in the health sector. Unnecessary and potentially harmful health service use accounts for a significant proportion of total health expenditure.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> One initiative that has gained momentum worldwide is Choosing WiselyÂ®, a campaign that has now been adapted and implemented in more than 20 countries.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The campaign seeks to encourage clinicians and patients to talk about medical tests and procedures that may be unnecessary and, in some instances, can cause physical and psychological harm.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> While acknowledging that it is often challenging to have conversations about unnecessary tests and treatments, leaders of the campaign consider communication between clinicians and patients during routine clinical encounters a key mechanism for change.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> To this end, 1 of the 4 key pillars of the Choosing Wisely International Roundtableâs Framework for Patient and Public Engagement in Choosing Wisely Campaigns was to support shared decision-making (SDM) at the clinical level.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
            <p>As part of the original Choosing Wisely campaign, 5 questions were developed for patients to ask healthcare providers to support better conversations about unnecessary tests, medications, and procedures.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The questions are publicly available and have been promoted for use nationally and internationally in several forms and languages.</p>
            <p>In Australia, the Choosing Wisely AustraliaÂ® 5 Questions (<xref rid="table1-0272989X231184461" ref-type="table">Box 1</xref>) have been promoted for their âpotential to facilitate better conversations between healthcare providers and consumers.â<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, annual evaluation surveys conducted by Choosing Wisely AustraliaÂ® have primarily assessed consumer awareness of the questions and the number of downloads of a resource explaining the questions, rather than their impact on peopleâs self-efficacy, ability, and intention to use the questions to engage in SDM.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This focus on reach rather than impact is mirrored internationally,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> with increasing calls for more thorough evaluations to generate cross-national insights on tools to advance the Choosing Wisely approach.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Despite this, a systematic review of interventions designed to reduce medical care identified as low-value by Choosing Wisely published in 2021 continued to identify few randomized trials internationally and a âdearth of studiesâ evaluating the impact of consumer-based Choosing Wisely interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>

            <p>Since then, a single prospective, randomized controlled trial in 3 intensive care units in Western Australia evaluated the impact of providing families with the Choosing Wisely questions as printed prompts prior to a family meeting. The primary outcome was family perceived involvement in decision-making. Of the 60 families who participated in the study, most (87.1% control, 79.3% intervention; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â=â0.334) reported feeling âvery includedâ in decision-making,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> with no difference in primary or secondary outcomes and minimal uptake of the questions by the intervention group.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Another qualitative study with 22 Australian general practice patients suggested that participants considered the Choosing Wisely questions to be valuable in guiding patients to reflect on decisions with their doctor and to take greater responsibility for their health care decisions.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, participants felt that use of the questions in their own health care was not necessary for several reasons: they perceived doctors made the ârightâ decision for their management (in this case, requesting a computed tomography scan); they had an established relationship with, and trust in, their general practitioner (GP); the GP had communicated about benefits and harms already; and/or because the âdoctor knew best.â Several participants also noted that an explanation of the 5 Choosing Wisely questions would be needed for the questions to be used.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Other findings from Choosing Wisely AustraliaÂ® suggested that people may continue to feel that they do not have permission to ask questions.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Together, this existing evidence suggests that the 5 questions alone may not be sufficient for enabling patient question asking. However, their impact on peopleâs self-efficacy, ability, and intention to engage in SDM is yet to be formally evaluated.</p>
            <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the Choosing Wisely AustraliaÂ® 5 Questions resource (âQuestionsâ). The primary outcomes were 1) self-efficacy to ask questions and be involved in decision-making and 2) intention to engage in SDM. Secondary outcomes included intention to follow the treatment plan without further questioning, knowledge of the patientsâ rights regarding SDM, positive attitude toward SDM, preparedness for SDM, acceptability of interventions, and proactive intervention use.</p>

                <p>Quantitative data analyses were conducted using Stata/IC v16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) by a study statistician blinded to the intervention allocation of participants and their level of health literacy. Primary and secondary outcome data were analyzed as intention to treat using linear regression for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for dichotomous categorical outcomes. Dichotomous variables representing the study factors (Video: yes, noâÃâQuestions: yes, noâÃâhealth literacy: adequate, inadequate) and their interactions were included in models as between-subjects fixed effects, controlling for preintervention values (where available). Pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means between the intervention arms and control were also explored, with Cohenâs <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> provided as a measure of effect size. Outcome data collected during the immediate post and follow-up survey were analyzed in separate models. A <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of 0.05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance. In line with our published protocol,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> multiple imputation was used to impute missing responses on primary outcomes for participants who completed the initial (pre- and post-) surveys but did not return to complete the 2-wk follow-up survey. The conclusions drawn from these analyses were comparable to complete case analysis, so in the interest of brevity, only complete case analysis is reported in text.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study sought to assess the impact of the consumer Choosing Wisely questions, both alone and in combination with an additional video intervention, using a randomized design. Both the Choosing Wisely Questions and SDM Preparation Video performed significantly better than control for improving participantsâ intention to engage in SDM immediately post-intervention but not at 2-wk follow-up. Both interventions, whether presented independently or combined, also resulted in participants identifying significantly more questions that align with Choosing Wisely, including after 2 wks. We found some evidence that the video improved outcomes compared with control in ways that the Choosing Wisely questions alone did not, including lower intention to follow a low-value treatment plan without further questions and more positive attitude toward SDM. We also found that combining the video and Choosing Wisely questions led to a greater increase in intention to engage in SDM at immediate follow-up than presenting the Choosing Wisely questions alone. However, neither intervention changed participantsâ self-efficacy to ask questions and be involved in decision-making, which was already high in this study, nor affected perceptions of preparedness to engage in SDM or knowledge of rights to be involved in healthcare decision-making.</p>
              <p>Our findings align with and extend previous research. Building on primarily descriptive findings related to the reach of the consumer Choosing Wisely questions, this is the first study to show an impact of these questions on consumer outcomes in the context of low-value care, including on recall and intentions to engage in SDM. We also observed some modest benefits of an SDM preparation video compared with control and the Choosing Wisely questions. This aligns with suggestions that people may need additional support to be involved in decision-making (e.g., reassurance that participation would not result in retribution<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>) over and above providing tools such as question prompt lists.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> This is the first study to quantitatively show this in relation to the Choosing Wisely questions. Joseph-Williams et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> initially recommended that preparatory support for SDM be provided by patientsâ clinicians prior to a consultation (e.g., embedded within an appointment letter). However, the video used in this study included research team members and a general practitioner who was not known to participants. While we may have observed larger impacts if clinicians provided this reassurance themselves, high-quality evidence is needed to confirm this.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> A generic video, such as that used in our study, also represents a more time and cost-efficient intervention model that is potentially scalable.</p>
              <p>Despite some positive impacts, interventions in this study did not uniformly improve all outcomes, including several outcomes for which there is a theoretical relationship. Models of behavior change, for example, often assume that self-efficacy expectations will significantly increase the prediction of behavioral intentions.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> However, we did not observe differences in self-efficacy to ask questions or be involved in health decisions despite changes in intentions to engage in SDM. Given that it is possible that self-efficacy, which was high across all groups at baseline, was overestimated in this hypothetical study, future research is needed to explore this relationship in real-world low-value care settings. It is also possible that other unmeasured variables known to impact health behavior, such as subjective norms, may have affected intentions. This too points to an important direction for low-value care research.</p>
              <p>There were also several variables included in this study with some level of conceptual overlap (e.g., preparedness for SDM and self-efficacy). Although outside the scope of our preplanned analysis, it would be useful to explore the predictive value of individual variables on patient outcomes in both hypothetical and clinical research settings.</p>
              <p>Despite some significant findings, effect sizes for all interventions were small, as has been the case for other SDM interventions in low-value care contexts.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> A recent systematic review of overuse concepts found that they are difficult to grasp, sometimes received skeptically, have limited effect on behavioral intentions, and fit uncomfortably with a range of entrenched broader beliefs.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> This review helps to contextualize the small differences in outcomes observed in our study (including improvements in intentions to engage SDM and awareness and recall of SDM questions). There may still be value in pursuing simple, low-cost strategies such as SDM videos and prompt lists, which are immediately implementable given these possible (albeit small) benefits. Future research should continue to explore the application and impact of individual-level interventions in real-world clinical contexts alongside the implementation of macro-level strategies enacted by the government or national institutes to make low-value care inaccessible or unprofitable.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Interventions in this study were delivered online to a community sample using hypothetical scenarios. We considered demonstrating the evidence of impact on cognitive and affective outcomes an important first step before moving to more intensive, costly, and burdensome effectiveness evaluations in clinical settings. This study design also allowed for targeted recruitment of people with lower health literacy and enabled us to randomly allocate a large sample of participants to achieve adequate statistical power to detect small differences in outcomes. Another strength was the blinded preplanned analysis.</p>
                <p>However, the generalizability of our findings may be limited due to the use of a hypothetical scenario, measuring intention rather than behavior, and the controlled conditions that meant that interventions were delivered in a way that diverges from how they would be delivered in the real world. Results may have also been influenced by the repeated measures, which could have led to a satisficing bias among participants, thus reducing group differences. Only 36% of participants reported a history of back pain, and so we may expect different results for clinical populations. Our study was further limited by recruiting through a social research panel. Although Dynata samples from a participant panel that is closely aligned with sociodemographic characteristics of the national population, it is possible that this sample would have had greater motivation to ask questions and be involved in health care decisions than people in the general community. Administering the interventions to assess their effectiveness in a more real-world setting may produce more accurate estimates of effect sizes.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Reducing low-value health services is a complex issue, with significant clinical and health policy implications. This is the first randomized study to demonstrate that the consumer Choosing Wisely questions and a video intervention to promote question asking and engagement in SDM may improve participantsâ intention to engage in SDM and support them in identifying questions that align with the Choosing Wisely campaign (with some additional benefits of the video intervention in reducing willingness to accept treatment without asking questions). Although effect sizes are small, and we did not find significant improvements on all outcomes and at all time points, the simple, low-cost nature of the interventions may make them appropriate for implementation within a suite of approaches to address low-value care at a population level.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0272989X231184461" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Future studies in clinical contexts will help to confirm this.</p>
