                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Many people experience withdrawal symptoms when they attempt to stop antidepressants. Withdrawal symptoms are readily misconstrued for relapse or ongoing need for medication, contributing to long-term use (&gt; 12 months). Long-term antidepressant use is increasing internationally yet is not recommended for most people. Long-term use is associated with adverse effects including weight gain, sexual dysfunction, lethargy, emotional numbing and increased risk of falls and fractures. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of two multi-strategy interventions (RELEASE and RELEASE+) in supporting the safe cessation of long-term antidepressants, estimate cost-effectiveness, and evaluate implementation strategies.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">3-arm pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial effectiveness-implementation hybrid type-1. Setting: primary care general practices in southeast Queensland, Australia. Population: adults 18 years or older taking antidepressants for longer than 1 year. Practices will be randomised on a 1.5:1:1 ratio of Usual care:RELEASE:RELEASE+. Intervention: RELEASE for patients includes evidence-based information and resources and an invitation to medication review; RELEASE for GPs includes education, training and printable resources via practice management software. RELEASE+ includes additional internet support for patients and prescribing support including audit and feedback for GPs. Outcome measures: the primary outcome is antidepressant use at 12 months self-reported by patients. Cessation is defined as 0 mg antidepressant maintained for at least 2 weeks. Secondary outcomes: at 6 and 12 months are health-related quality of life, antidepressant side effects, well-being, withdrawal symptoms, emotional numbing, beliefs about antidepressants, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms; and at 12 months 75% reduction in antidepressant dose; aggregated practice level antidepressant prescribing, and health service utilisation for costs. Sample size: 653 patients from 28 practices. A concurrent evaluation of implementation will be through mixed methods including interviews with up to 40 patients and primary care general practitioners, brief e-surveys, and study administrative data to assess implementation outcomes (adoption and fidelity).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par21">Antidepressant use is increasing internationally, mostly driven by increasing long-term use (&gt; 12 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Approximately 1 in 7 adults is now taking antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and half of users are long-term users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Yet there is no reliable evidence for the benefits of long-term antidepressant use due to the short duration of acute treatment trials and methodological limitations of relapse prevention trials including confounding by withdrawal symptoms and selection of responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Clinical guidelines recommend only 6–12 months of antidepressant therapy for a single episode of moderate to severe depression and psychological therapies for anxiety and less severe depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is evidence for harm with long-term use including weight gain, sexual dysfunction which may be persistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], lethargy, emotional numbing (“reduced sympathy and empathy” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and “caring less about others” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]), and increased risk of falls and fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par22">Many people experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when they attempt to stop taking antidepressants. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, low mood, dizziness, ‘brain fog’, irritability, headache, and insomnia, which can last for weeks or months with severity likely proportional to duration of use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Withdrawal symptoms are often misconstrued, by both patients and doctors, as relapse or ongoing need for medication contributing to long-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par23">Australia’s 2020 Productivity Commission Mental Health Inquiry report highlighted the problem of increasing antidepressant use and associated adverse effects and recommended as a “priority reform” to “address adverse outcomes from prescribing practices of mental health medication” (p.3)c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The report stated that: “while antipsychotic prescribing in aged care facilities is one element of this … arguably a greater concern, given its frequency, is antidepressant prescribing” (p.713) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Data suggest that 30–50% of long-term antidepressant users have no clinical indication for continued use and could try stopping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par24">Important factors for stopping antidepressants include reviewing the need for ongoing therapy, recognising withdrawal symptoms, slow tapering of drug dose, availability of drug mini-doses, and monitoring and reassurance to address the fear of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Non-randomised evidence supports hyperbolic tapering of drug doses to minimise withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hyperbolic tapering uses increasingly smaller decreases in drug dose which generates a steady decrease in brain receptor occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Hyperbolic tapering is now recommended in clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par25">Most antidepressant prescribing occurs in primary care general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], where implementation of tapering is negligible and there is low awareness and recognition of withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients report being advised to wean off antidepressants over about 4 weeks by halving their dose and then halving again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Further, tapering protocols and drug mini-doses are often not readily available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. While there is the opportunity to review the need for ongoing antidepressant therapy at every repeat prescription in general practice, medication review alone is not effective for supporting the cessation of long-term antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The RELEASE and RELEASE+ interventions were designed to address these factors.</p>
                <p id="Par26">The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two multi-strategy interventions, RELEASE and RELEASE+, in supporting safe cessation of long-term antidepressants compared to Usual care.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria {10}</title>
                <p id="Par37">Patients 18 years or older will be eligible if they are currently taking antidepressant medication and have been taking medication for longer than 12 months, including both patients who are motivated and unmotivated to stop. Antidepressants include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and citalopram), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine) and other antidepressants (mirtazapine, vortioxetine, mianserin, moclobemide, reboxetine, agomelatine). Patients will be excluded if they have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder or dementia; are currently under the care of a psychiatrist; have a non-psychiatric indication for an antidepressant (for example, neuropathic pain); are unable to give informed consent; live in residential aged care; or if the GP considers the patient not suitable for medication review.</p>

                <title>Who will take informed consent? {26a}</title>
                <p id="Par38">Eligible patients who have been taking antidepressants for longer than 12 months are identified through an automated search of the practice database and a list of patients is generated for each general practitioner (GP). The automated search system applies inclusion and exclusion criteria. General practitioners review the list and de-select any remaining ineligible patients and those not suitable for medication review, recording the reason for exclusion. The practice contacts patients remaining on the list via SMS, email or letter (depending on practice preference) to inform them about the study and to advise that the practice will phone to discuss the study and invite their participation, where practicable including the participant information sheet. Patients may opt out of this phone call by contacting the practice.</p>
                <p id="Par39">The practice phones patients to discuss the study. At the phone call, patients who express an interest in participating or who wish for further information have their name and email address entered into the secure research data collection tool REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt, USA). REDCap generates an automated email to these patients with a link to the participant information sheet, consent and baseline e-survey. Patients who wish to participate may click the link and provide signed electronic consent, and then the link to complete the baseline e-survey.</p>

                <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                <p id="Par41">The RELEASE and RELEASE+ interventions are informed by the 3As (Ask, Advise, Assist) model of brief interventions for patient-centred care and designed to prompt and support safe cessation of long-term antidepressants using hyperbolic tapering of drug dose. Qualitative interviews with GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and a think-aloud study with patients with lived experience of long-term antidepressant use (under review for publication) informed intervention development. The 3As is an evidence-based behaviour change model with demonstrated feasibility in the general practice setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The 3As in this context include ‘Asking’ patients how long they have been on antidepressants, and whether they are aware that clinical guidelines usually recommend only 6 to 12 months of antidepressant therapy; ‘Advising’ patients that long-term use is not harmless, that withdrawal symptoms are common but often misconstrued for relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; and that hyperbolic tapering of drug dose can minimise withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; and ‘Assisting’ patients by providing drug-specific hyperbolic tapering protocols and prescriptions for requisite drug mini-doses.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Control patients receive care as usual without mailout or invitation to schedule a medication review appointment. As usual, control group patients may see their GP to obtain a repeat prescription for antidepressants and may decrease or stop antidepressants at any time. This is permitted as in both arms of the trial all prescribing decisions are made as usual by GP and patient together. General practitioners in the control group receive their list of patients on long-term antidepressants for review as outlined above and receive quarterly newsletters with trial updates.</p>

                <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                <p id="Par43">RELEASE and RELEASE+ are user-informed multi-strategy interventions designed to prompt and support safe cessation of long-term antidepressants. The interventions include for patients, information about antidepressants, resources and an invitation to schedule and attend an appointment with their GP to discuss and review their use of antidepressants; and for GPs, printable resources, education and training.</p>
                <p id="Par44">For patients, RELEASE includes a study pack that is sent to patients via both email and post containing resources including the (i) medicines information brochure titled “Stopping antidepressants”; (ii) decision aid; (iii) antidepressant tapering protocol; and (iv) a letter inviting patients to schedule and attend an appointment with their GP to discuss and review their antidepressant use. Where feasible, practices reiterate this invitation by sending an SMS to patients inviting them to schedule and attend this medication review appointment. Automated email prompts are sent every 4 weeks for 6 months to remind participants to schedule and attend this review appointment. Usual costs apply to the medication review to enable scalability. Any follow-up is decided by GP and patient together.</p>
                <p id="Par45">The medicines information brochure is designed to raise awareness of clinical guideline recommendations and long-term antidepressant adverse effects, increase recognition of withdrawal symptoms, and to prompt people to reconsider their long-term antidepressant use. The decision aid is designed to help people to consider the pros and cons of continuing or stopping antidepressants and to support shared decision-making. The tapering protocol provides step-by-step guidance for hyperbolic tapering of antidepressant drug dose and advice on withdrawal symptoms including advice to return to the previous drug dose if symptoms are severe and when ready try again using an even more gradual taper. Consistent with patient-centred care, the tapering protocols are designed to be flexible with the patient in charge of tapering speed, enabling patients to taper more slowly or more quickly depending on symptoms. The invitation letter is designed to prompt medication review and a RELEASE conversation between patient and GP.</p>
                <p id="Par46">For GPs, RELEASE includes (i) an interactive e-learning module including vignettes with experts in the field; (ii) an outreach visit with in-person training in the RELEASE process including prescribing for hyperbolic tapering of antidepressants; (iii) tailoring of the practice management software to include printable drug-specific tapering protocols and customised prescriptions for requisite antidepressant drug mini-doses needed for tapering; (iv) optional comment on participant e-health record to flag study participants to GPs; and (v) a study pack containing a one-page overview of the RELEASE process and printed copies of RELEASE resources (medicines information brochure, decision aid, tapering protocol). The GPs in intervention practices may access and print out a tapering protocol and/or custom prescription through the e-health record of any patient. To reduce the risk of cross-practice contamination where GPs work in more than one practice, these resources are not available to GPs in any Usual care or non-participating practice.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Local community pharmacies near to intervention practices are also provided with a letter with information about the study and the issue of long-term antidepressant use seeking their support for patient participants who elect to taper and discontinue antidepressants.</p>
                <p id="Par48">RELEASE+ includes, in addition to the above, for patients, internet-supported access to the resources, messaging and e-mental health supports; and for GPs, additional prescribing support with continuing professional development eligible activities including clinical audit and feedback on antidepressant prescribing.</p>

Since long-term antidepressant use can cause emotional numbing, not caring about others, and a sense of dependence on medication, stopping antidepressants may lead to the reverse of these which may be captured by the WEMWBS scale, or alternatively a worsening in response to a loss of potential beneficial antidepressant effects. This scale has been shown to be responsive to change following mental health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>

The cost of the intervention will be estimated based on resource use and implementation data collected during the trial (including educator and doctor time, costs for RELEASE and RELEASE+ resources and website, practice nurse time for search, GP time to review list, and cost of compounding capsules). A cost questionnaire will be administered to participants to collect data on health and social service resource use, out-of-pocket spending, and time off work.

This will optimise our likelihood of effecting change through the identification and resolution of actionable barriers and enhancement of enablers (e.g. whether GPs consider RELEASE and RELEASE+ a ‘good fit’ for practice workflows in routine practice; and GPs and patient participants’ perspectives on the content and appropriateness of the resources). A bespoke database will be used to record implementation outcomes including adoption (e.g., number of practices and GPs approached to take part, and taking part; number of patients de-selected by GPs and why; and proportion of eligible patients that enrol); and fidelity to intervention (e.g., proportion of GPs who engage with the interactive e-learning module; and number of patients who follow the drug-specific tapers as evidenced by clinical notes and self-report).</p>

                <p id="Par69">Based on a 2020 trial, we assume 12% of participants in the control group and 30% of participants in each of the intervention groups will achieve the primary outcome (stopped antidepressants by 12 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Because the study involves two comparisons, Usual care vs RELEASE and Usual care vs RELEASE+, we will allocate more participants to the Usual care arm as this increases the overall efficiency of the trial (that is, for fixed type I and type II errors we require fewer total participants). The ratio chosen for allocation is 1.5:1:1. Using a two-sided alpha significance level of 0.035 (chosen to facilitate comparison of the two intervention arms against a single control arm) and 90% power then, without accounting for clustering, we would require 142 participants in the Usual care arm and 95 in each of the intervention arms (332 total).</p>
                <p id="Par70">As this is a cluster RCT, we need to account for the non-independence of observations from individual participants recruited from the same practice. We assume there will be a mean of 20 participants recruited from each practice who will provide data on the primary outcome, and that the within-practice intra-cluster correlation = 0.03, giving a design effect of 1.57. Consequently, we require 522 participants to provide data. To achieve this number, and to account for the possible drop-out of practices once enrolled, we will recruit 28 practices. Assuming 20% attrition, we require 653 participants to enrol and provide baseline data. This requires the 28 practices to recruit an average of 23.3 patients.</p>

Of these potentially eligible patients, we expect GPs to deselect 30% as not suitable for medication review leaving 84 eligible patients per practice for invitation. To achieve recruitment of 653 participants requires each of the 28 practices to enrol 28% of the 84 invited eligible patients (2352 invited in total).</p>

As outlined above, eligible patients on long-term antidepressants are identified through an automated search of the practice database and a list of potentially eligible patients is generated for each GP. The automated search system is compatible with the two most commonly used practice management software systems in Australia (BestPractice, Medical Director). General practitioners review the list and de-select ineligible patients and those not suitable for medication review, recording the reason for exclusion. The practice contacts eligible patients via SMS, email or letter (depending on practice preference) including the participant information sheet where possible, to inform patients about the study and to advise that the practice will phone to discuss the study and invite their participation. Patients may opt out of this phone call by contacting the practice. The practice phones patients to discuss the study.</p>
                <p id="Par73">At the phone call, patients who express an interest in participating or who wish to receive further information have their name and email address entered into the secure research data collection tool REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt, USA). REDCap generates an automated email to these patients with a ‘closed’ link (i.e., specific to the patient’s email) with the Participant Information Sheet, and a link to consent and the baseline e-survey. Patients who decide to participate click the link to provide signed electronic consent. They may then complete the baseline e-survey.</p>

                <p id="Par87">Outcomes will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. We may also present a per-protocol analysis. Summary statistics will be described using either mean (standard deviation) or median (25th–75th percentile) for continuous variables, according to distribution, or as frequency (percentage) for categorical variables.</p>
                <p id="Par88">The primary outcome will be assessed using mixed-effects logistic regression, with effect estimates presented as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The treatment group (Usual care/RELEASE/RELEASE+) will be included as the main fixed effect and the practice will be included as a random effect to account for probable non-independence of results from participants who attend the same practice. The primary outcomes of interest are the between-group comparisons of RELEASE versus Usual care and RELEASE+ versus Usual care. Secondary outcomes will similarly be analysed using mixed-effects models, using linear regression for interval outcomes, logistic regression for binary outcomes, and Poisson regression for count outcomes. All models will include the practice as a random effect. Longitudinal associations will be investigated using analyses that account for the multiple observations per participant, with the particular analysis determined by data structure, for example, three-level hierarchical mixed-effects models with ‘patient’ nested within ‘GP’ nested within ‘practice’ where appropriate. Regarding missing data, sensitivity analyses will be conducted using imputation models. Patients who drop out before assessment will be classified as ‘not able to stop’.</p>
                <p id="Par89">Differences between groups in total cost for the within-trial analysis will be assessed using a general linear model (gamma family, log link). QALYs will be estimated for the within-trial analysis based on responses to the SF-12 Short Form QoL instrument and Australian utility algorithm using an area under the curve approach and a base case threshold value of $50,000, as this is a commonly cited threshold value in Australia. Differences between groups will be tested using a student t-test where the assumption of normal distribution holds and generalised linear models in the case of non-normally distributed data. Multi-level regression analysis to correct for correlation of error at each cluster will be used to characterise uncertainty around the estimated incremental net monetary benefit for the within-trial analysis. A Markov model will also be used to estimate the costs and QALYs over a patient’s lifetime under a range of extrapolation scenarios. The determination of whether RELEASE or RELEASE+ represents the greatest value for money will be determined based on the ranking of their incremental net monetary benefit values. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) will assess the probability of RELEASE and RELEASE+ as the most cost-effective option over a range of threshold values.</p>

              <p id="Par104">This study transitioned from a 2-arm trial to a 3-arm trial subsequent to receiving additional funding. The 3-arm trial enables us to test both a more and less intensive intervention for supporting the safe cessation of long-term antidepressants when there is no clinical indication for continued use. The study will develop new evidence on the (i) effectiveness of the RELEASE and RELEASE+ multi-strategy interventions in supporting the safe cessation of long-term antidepressants, (ii) implementation in practice and potential for scale-up, and (iii) cost-effectiveness. This new knowledge is applicable to primary healthcare systems internationally to address increasing long-term antidepressant use to improve health outcomes.</p>
