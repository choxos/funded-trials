                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Acute severe behavioural disturbance (ASBD) is a condition seen with increasing frequency in emergency departments (EDs) in adults and young people. Despite the increasing number of presentations and significant associated risks to patients, families and caregivers, there is limited evidence to guide the most effective pharmacological management in children and adolescents. The aim of this study is to determine whether a single dose of oral olanzapine is more effective than a dose of oral diazepam at successfully sedating young people with ASBD.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study is a multicentre, open-label, superiority randomised controlled trial. Young people aged between 9 years and 17 years and 364 days presenting to an ED with ASBD who are deemed to require medication for behavioural containment will be recruited to the study. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 allocation between a single weight-based dose of oral olanzapine and oral diazepam. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who achieve successful sedation at 1-hour post randomisation without the need for additional sedation. Secondary outcomes will include assessing for adverse events, additional medications provided in the ED, further episodes of ASBD, length of stay in the ED and hospital and satisfaction with management.</p>
                  <p>Effectiveness will be determined using an intention-to-treat analysis, with medication efficacy determined as part of the secondary outcomes using a per-protocol analysis. The primary outcome of successful sedation at 1 hour will be presented as a percentage within each treatment group, with comparisons presented as a risk difference with its 95% CIs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Acute severe behavioural disturbance (ASBD) is a common clinical condition in children and adolescents.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> It poses significant physical and psychological risks to the patient and those caring for them.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These young people often present to the emergency department (ED) for management.</p>
              <p>ASBD can be related to a range of underlying causes. In children and young people, common causes include mental health conditions, psychosocial problems and neurodevelopmental disorders.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4</xref> Less commonly, recreational substance use, self-poisoning or other organic causes are contributing factors. It is often difficult to elucidate the aetiology of the presentation prior to behavioural containment being achieved. As a result, these young people require urgent and effective management, thus allowing the treating clinician to assess the reason for their presentation and provide appropriate ongoing care.</p>
              <p>ASBD is managed using a stepwise plan.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Non-pharmacological strategies are attempted first, followed by medication if required. Oral administration is the preferred option when medication is being used. If the young person’s behaviour cannot be contained with non-pharmacological strategies and they are either unwilling or unable to accept oral medication, and they pose a risk to themselves or others, they are provided with parenteral medication to achieve rapid behavioural control.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The study team are undertaking a separate study of intramuscular medications for the management of paediatric ASBD using a similar study design in patients in whom intramuscular medication is deemed the most appropriate course of action, the protocol for which has also been published.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p>
              <p>There is currently limited evidence supporting the use of any specific oral medication for ASBD in children and young people.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> There is no high-quality, prospective literature comparing the effectiveness or assessing the side effect profiles of these medications. Due to the increasing prevalence of ASBD presentations to the ED and the scarce literature regarding treatment, the research team conceived this study to determine the most effective oral medication for the management of paediatric ASBD.</p>
              <p>The choice of medications to include in the study was based on the limited literature available,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 8</xref> the agents currently recommended at the study hospitals<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 9–11</xref> and a national Australian survey of the management practices and trial medication preferences of adult and paediatric emergency physicians for paediatric ASBD.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The regional guidelines suggested use of any of olanzapine, lorazepam, diazepam, risperidone or quetiapine as possible primary agents.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 9–11</xref> In the national survey, there was considerable variation in practice and olanzapine and diazepam were preferred to be included in a comparative trial. In this study, we aim to assess the relative effectiveness of these interventions by assessing whether a single dose of oral olanzapine is superior to a single dose of oral diazepam in successfully sedating young people presenting with ASBD who require oral medication.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>This is a multicentre, open-label, superiority randomised controlled trial (RCT). The allocation ratio between comparison groups is 1:1. This trial protocol has been prepared using the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials checklist.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>The research team engaged a group of parent consumers with lived experience caring for children with mental health related conditions including ASBD. These individuals were approached as they had supported their child through an episode of acute mental illness in the ED. The group were presented with an overview of the research and details of the protocol were explored during a number of meetings. They assisted in refining the study protocol and ensuring that the views of consumers were represented within the research.</p>
                <p>These parent consumers will have ongoing involvement throughout the life of the study. Regular updates will be provided in a written format while data collection is being undertaken. Once the study results are available, they will be provided to parent consumers, allowing them a chance to comment on the findings, and their feedback will be incorporated into any publications or presentations. They will also be involved in the knowledge translation of the results of the study.</p>

                <title>Setting and participants</title>
                <p>Participants will be recruited at 10 EDs across Australia: Children’s Hospital at Westmead Sydney, Gold Coast University Hospital, Grampian’s Health Ballarat, Monash Children’s Hospital Melbourne, Perth Children’s Hospital, Queensland Children’s Hospital Brisbane, Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne, Sunshine Coast University Hospital, Western Health Sunshine Hospital Melbourne and Women’s and Children’s Hospital Adelaide. We aim to recruit 35 participants per site between October 2021 and December 2023, to achieve our sample size of 348 participants. We believe this is feasible within the specified time frame based on our review of un-published audit data.</p>

                <title>The Sedation Assessment Tool</title>
                <p>There is no validated assessment tool for behavioural disturbance in children and adolescents presenting to the ED. Ideally, such a tool would include a grading of both agitation and the possible resulting sedation or over-sedation. In adult ASBD studies a range of tools including the Richmond agitation sedation scale,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the altered mental status score<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and observer assessment of alertness/sedation<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> have previously been used.</p>
                <p>The only tool validated for use in the ASBD population in the ED which assesses both agitation and sedation on the same scale is the Sedation Assessment Tool (SAT),<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> which has been used in a number of adult studies.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> It has not been validated in children and adolescents. This tool is a 7-point scale that assesses the patient’s responsiveness and speech (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Using these descriptors, a score of +3 (highly agitated) to −3 (highly sedated) is determined. The score takes approximately 10 seconds to complete and has good inter-rater reliability.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We will use the SAT to assess eligibility of the young person and the primary outcome.</p>

                <p>Young people aged between 9 and 17 years and 364 days will be included if they have ASBD and the treating team is planning to administer oral medication to manage their condition. Including an SAT of ≥+1 in the inclusion criteria ensures only participants with ASBD are enrolled.</p>
                <p>The remaining inclusion criteria will ensure that the participant’s ASBD is being managed in the least restrictive means feasible while preserving patient and staff safety.</p>
                <p>Exclusion criteria include a range of safety and pragmatic factors. Children and adolescents with known long QT syndrome will be excluded due to the risk (although small) of iatrogenic long QT with olanzapine.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Young people who are known to be pregnant will be excluded due to sparse safety data for the study medications in pregnancy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Those potential participants who had a previous non-response to either study medication or whose parent/guardian refuses one of the two study medications will be excluded to ensure that no young person is enrolled to receive a medication that had previously been ineffective. Patient and parent/guardian reports, established behavioural management plans and medical records will be used to determine prior medication ineffectiveness.</p>
                <p>Participants who the clinician deems as being more suitable to receive drugs via an alternative route or administration of an alternative therapy will also be excluded from the study.</p>
                <p>The remaining exclusion criteria—that participants can only be enrolled in PEAChY-O once and cannot be enrolled in its sister trial PEAChY-M (a study comparing intramuscular olanzapine vs intramuscular droperidol for ASBD requiring intramuscular sedation) during the same admission—are to avoid complications with non-independence of observations, and the difficulty of following two protocols simultaneously.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome and most of the secondary outcomes of the trial are being assessed relative to the time of randomisation. This approach was chosen to ensure that all processes which would occur day to day in the ED—including the time taken to locate and dispense the medication and negotiate with the young person to take the medication—were accounted for. In addition to these outcomes assessing the effectiveness of the trial intervention, the efficacy of the medications being used will also be determined in the secondary outcome assessments.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who achieve successful sedation without the requirement for additional sedation 1-hour post randomisation. Successful sedation will be assessed by the treating clinician and is defined as reaching an SAT of ≤0 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="boxed-text">box 2</xref>) include the number adverse events (AEs); length of stay (LOS); injuries to staff, participants or parents/guardians; disposition; satisfaction with care; associated costs and whether a participant ingests the medication.

                <p>The research team provided extensive education on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, data collection and other trial processes to ED clinicians, nursing staff and mental health clinicians as the key staff involved in the care of these young people in the ED prior to commencement of the trial. Ongoing education will be provided while the trial is being conducted.</p>
                <p>Randomisation will be conducted using sealed opaque envelopes produced according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule. Once the participant has been enrolled, the ED clinician will open the next randomisation envelope, which will reveal the trial drug allocation. This is an open-label study so the clinician and participant will be aware of the medication to which the participant has been randomised. The rationale for making this an open-label study is to ensure that clinicians will be able to rapidly identify class-specific AEs that may occur and treat these appropriately.</p>
                <p>Medication dosing will be weight based, with participants weighing &lt;40 kg receiving 5 mg of either drug and those weighing 40 kg or greater receiving 10 mg. If the child’s weight is not known, it will be estimated using the clinician’s best guess.</p>
                <p>The time at which the randomisation envelope is opened will be time zero for the study.</p>
                <p>Only one dose of medication will be provided as part of the trial, with no dose modification allowances. The one exception to this is that a repeat dose can be provided if the young person spits out or vomits the trial medication within 5 min of administration.</p>
                <p>Participants will be observed for 1 hour from randomisation, at which time the primary outcome will be assessed by the treating clinician. The treating clinician will document the primary and other secondary outcomes measured at this time on a paper-based case report form (CRF) (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>). They will also record details of when the medication was ingested and whether the dose was repeated within 5 min. Data on AEs during the ED admission will also be collected on the paper CRF, as will the clinician’s assessment of the likely cause of the ASBD. They will be asked to determine if, in their opinion, the participant was successfully sedated. The clinician will also provide details on what non-pharmacological de-escalation techniques were used while the young person was in the ED. They will complete a satisfaction survey at this 1-hour post randomisation time point and provide one to the young person and/or guardian to complete if feasible. A participant information form will also be offered to the young person and/or their guardian at this this time point to those who are willing and able to accept this handout.</p>

The TSC will meet regularly to discuss the progress of the trial, review recruitment and AEs. This will ensure there is a forum for contemporaneously identifying and addressing issues.</p>
                <p>An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has been established for this study. It includes two independent clinicians experienced in the care for young people with ASBD and the conduct and monitoring of RCTs, and a biostatistician who is experienced in the monitoring of RCTs. The role of the PEAChY-O DSMB is to review data related to recruitment, safety and trial conduct. No interim analyses of the effectiveness or efficacy data will be performed. Data will be reviewed by the DSMB members in both an aggregated format in the open report and in the closed report in treatment groups labelled ‘A’ and ‘B’. The DSMB will review all data within 6 months of commencement of recruitment and then yearly. Following each meeting, the DSMB can recommend to continue the trial unchanged, continue with modifications or terminate the trial.</p>

                <p>Ethical approval to undertake the study was provided by the Royal Children’s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/66478/RCHM-2020). This approval incorporated a waiver of informed consent under the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> All participating sites have obtained governance approvals from their local Human Research Ethics Committees.</p>
                <p>As previously described, prior to the commencement of the study the research team engaged a consumer advisory group to seek advice regarding the structure of the protocol and the acceptability of the waiver of informed consent. A waiver of informed consent was endorsed by the consumer advisory group, as they felt that an ED encounter with a child presenting with ASBD would not be an appropriate setting to enter into a detailed discussion about risks and benefits of treatment, and that providing treatment in a timely manner was very important.</p>
                <p>This trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ANZCTR) on 13 September 2021 prior to recruitment commencing (ACTRN12621001236886). The Universal Trial Number for this study is U1111-1267-4036.</p>
                <p>The MCRI serves as the primary sponsor for this trial. The overall decision regarding all aspects of the trial falls to the PEAChY-O TSC with input from MCRI as the trial sponsor. The study funders do not have direct decision making or input into the day-to-day running of the trial, data interpretation or study publications.</p>
                <p>This protocol paper is based on Version 5.0 dated 6 June 2022 of the PEAChY-O protocol.</p>
                <p>Once the study has concluded we will present the results at relevant conferences and will publish the results in an international peer-reviewed journal. There are no limitations or restrictions on publication of this data.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our study is the first interventional study comparing any oral medications for the management of paediatric ASBD in the ED. It will provide useful effectiveness and efficacy data for these two medications that can be used to improve clinical care in this area. It will provide valuable information regarding the potential adverse effects of each medication in this patient population.</p>
              <p>Our study design has a number of limitations. The trial is open-label. This was necessary to ensure that any AEs that occurred could be recognised and rapidly acted on. This also means that clinical staff who are determining the SAT score will be aware of the study drug allocation. All investigators and the statisticians analysing the trial data will, however, be blinded to treatment allocation until the end of the study. Second, for feasibility and logistical reasons it is not possible to collect ‘time to effective sedation’ as the primary outcome.</p>
              <p>This study will have an impact on clinical practice in Australia but also more broadly. Paediatric patients with ASBD are a rapidly increasing patient population in whom limited research has been undertaken to determine the most effective medications for behavioural containment. We therefore anticipate our study to have significant clinical utility once the results are available.</p>
