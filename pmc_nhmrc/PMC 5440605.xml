                <p>Experimental studies show a substantial contribution of early life environment to obesity risk through epigenetic processes. We examined inter-individual DNA methylation differences in human birth tissues associated with child's adiposity. We identified a novel association between the level of CpG methylation at birth within the promoter of the long non-coding RNA ANRIL (encoded at <italic>CDKN2A</italic>) and childhood adiposity at age 6-years. An association between ANRIL methylation and adiposity was also observed in three additional populations; in birth tissues from ethnically diverse neonates, in peripheral blood from adolescents, and in adipose tissue from adults. Additionally, CpG methylation was associated with ANRIL expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, and CpG mutagenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibited ANRIL promoter activity. Furthermore, CpG methylation enhanced binding to an Estrogen Response Element within the ANRIL promoter. Our findings demonstrate that perinatal methylation at loci relevant to gene function may be a robust marker of later adiposity, providing substantial support for epigenetic processes in mediating long-term consequences of early life environment on human health.</p>

                <p>The quality of the early life environment before birth can affect susceptibility to metabolic disease later in the lifecourse, with epigenetic regulation of gene function thought to be one mechanism through which early life environmental factors induce persistent phenotypic changes. In this study, using DNA from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), we identified changes in DNA methylation levels at birth that associated with adiposity later in childhood within the promoter of ANRIL, a gene with strong disease associations that is involved in regulatiing cellular growth. This finding was replicated in several independent cohorts, and functionally validated in adipocyte cells.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Fixed variations in a number of genes have been linked to obesity (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Frayling et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Loos et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Thorleifsson et al., 2009</xref>), although to date single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations explain only a fraction of the risk of obesity and metabolic disease in humans (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Wellcome Trust Case Control, C, 2010</xref>). However, there is now substantial evidence from both human and animal studies that the quality of the early life environment before and after birth can affect susceptibility to metabolic disease in later life (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Godfrey and Barker, 2001</xref>). In humans, famine exposure during pregnancy (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Roseboom et al., 2006</xref>), maternal obesity (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Catalano and Ehrenberg, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>), and gestational diabetes (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Pettitt et al., 1991</xref>) are all associated with an increased risk of obesity in the offspring, while in animal studies variation in maternal diet has been linked to alterations in offspring metabolism and body composition (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bertram and Hanson, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Poston, 2010</xref>).</p>
              <p>Epigenetic regulation of gene function is one mechanism through which early life environmental factors could induce persistent phenotypic changes. For example, feeding rats a modest reduction in protein during pregnancy induced hypomethylation of the promoter regions of the nuclear receptors Glucocorticoid Receptor (<italic>NR3C1</italic>) and Peroxisome Proliferator activated receptor alpha (<italic>PPARA</italic>) in the liver of the offspring during adulthood, accompanied by increased <italic>NR3C1</italic> and <italic>PPARA</italic> gene expression, and alterations in the metabolic processes they control (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Lillycrop et al., 2007</xref>). In humans, differences in the methylation of imprinted and non-imprinted genes related to cardio-metabolic phenotypes have been found in the peripheral blood leukocytes of adults whose mothers were exposed to famine during pregnancy (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Heijmans et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with the paradigm that developmentally induced epigenetic marks make a significant contribution to later phenotype, DNA methylation within the promoter of the retinoid X receptor alpha (<italic>RXRA</italic>) gene in umbilical cords predicted¬†&gt;¬†25% of the variation in later %fat mass in children (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Godfrey et al., 2011</xref>), while PPAR-Œ≥-co-activator-1Œ± promoter methylation in blood at age 5‚Äì7¬†years predicted adiposity from 9 to 14¬†years (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Clarke-Harris et al., 2014a</xref>). As the identification of such epigenetic changes may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of adiposity and allow the identification of individuals at increased risk of metabolic disease, we carried out a discovery genome-scale DNA methylation scan to identify differences in DNA methylation levels in umbilical cord from children from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS) cohort associated with child's adiposity at age 6¬†years. We identified an association between the methylation level at birth of CpG loci within the promoter of ANRIL (antisense non-coding RNA in the <italic>INK4</italic> locus), a 3.8¬†kb non-coding RNA transcribed from the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene locus, and variation in total and %fat mass at 6¬†years. We also observed this association in cord tissue from ethnically diverse neonates from the Growing Up in Singapore with Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort (n¬†=¬†187), in peripheral blood from adolescents (n¬†=¬†812) in the Western Australian Pregnancy (RAINE) cohort, and in adipose tissue from adults (n¬†=¬†81) from the UK BIOCLAIMS cohort. Finally, we showed that CpG methylation at this locus was associated with ANRIL expression <italic>in vivo</italic> and CpG mutagenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibited ANRIL promoter activity. Furthermore, we identified an Estrogen Receptor-Œ± (ERŒ±) containing protein complex that binds to this region in a methylation specific manner and regulates transcription from this locus.</p>

                <title>Southampton Women's Survey (SWS): Participants</title>
                <p>The SWS is a prospective study that assessed the diet, body composition, physical activity and social circumstances of a large group of non-pregnant women aged 20‚Äì34¬†years in Southampton, UK. Comprehensive details have been published (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Inskip et al., 2006</xref>). Women who subsequently became pregnant were followed up during pregnancy with serial measurements of fetal size and their offspring studied in infancy and childhood (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>). There were 1981 women who became pregnant and delivered a live-born singleton infant before the end of 2003. Six infants died in the neonatal period and two had major congenital growth abnormalities, which left 1973 mother-offspring pairs. Triceps skinfold thickness at birth and age 1-year was measured using Holtain skinfold calipers (Holtain Ltd., Crymych, UK). A sub-set of children from the SWS study with dietary data in infancy was invited to take part in follow-up at ages 4 and 6-years to assess their body composition (Table S2). Adiposity measurements were made by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic Discovery, paediatric scan mode, Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA) (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Crozier et al., 2012</xref>). Follow-up of the children and sample collection/analysis was carried out under Institutional Review Board approval (Southampton and SW Hampshire Research Ethics Committee 06/Q1702/104) with written informed consent. Clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>

Ethical approval for the study was granted by the centralized Institute Review Board (CIRB) and the Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB), the ethics boards of KKH and NUH, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01174875" id="ir0005">NCT01174875</ext-link>). 1247 women (response rate 61.3%) were recruited; participant characteristics are shown in Table S6. Infant weight was measured to the nearest gram on a calibrated scale (SECA 334, SECA Corp, Hamburg, Germany). Recumbent crown‚Äìheel length was measured using an infant mobile measuring mat (SECA 210, SECA Corp Hamburg, Germany). At age 18¬†months ponderal index (weight/length (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Thorleifsson et al., 2009</xref>)) was derived as a measure of adiposity. Triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness were measured using Holtain skinfold calipers.</p>

                <p>The Raine Study enrolled pregnant women¬†‚â§¬†18th week of gestation (1989‚Äì1991) (N¬†=¬†2900) through the antenatal clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital and nearby private clinics in Perth, Western Australia. Detailed clinical assessments were performed at birth. Birth information (including birth weight and height) was obtained from midwife records. The children were followed up at multiple time points including at 17¬†years of age at which time physical assessments including weight, height, and skin fold assessments were performed as described previously (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Socioeconomic status was assessed by maternal education. Maternal weight and height was measured by a trained midwife at 18¬†weeks gestation. Early pregnancy weight was obtained at recruitment around 18¬†weeks gestation. Gestational age was based on the date of the last menstrual period unless there was discordance with ultrasound biometry at the dating scan. The Human Ethics Committees (King Edward Memorial Hospital and/or Princess Margaret Hospital) approved all protocols (RA/4/1/6613). Informed, written consent to participate in the study was obtained from the mother of each child at enrolment and at each subsequent follow-up.</p>

                <title>Test for Robustness to Failed Probe Signals</title>
                <p>It was observed that a portion of the probes included in the raw data had a log2 value approaching 0. These probes were assumed to be failed probes and were removed from the dataset and the modified dataset was subjected to the BATMAN algorithm. Any DMRs not robust between the two datasets were removed from consideration. A surrogate variable analysis (SVA) (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Leek et al., 2012</xref>) similar to the ‚Äúreference-free‚Äù analysis suggested by <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Houseman et al.

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Statistical analysis on the SWS was carried out using Stata (Statacorp) versions 11.2 and 12.1. Histograms of all continuous variables were plotted to check for normality. The distributions of some measures of adiposity were skewed and therefore transformed using a log<sub>e</sub> transformation. Conditional sex-specific abdominal circumference growth velocities (Z-scores) were calculated from antenatal ultrasound measurements as described previously (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Pike et al., 2010</xref>). Velocities of prenatal and infant growth were calculated from change in size adjusted for gestation or age, as appropriate. DXA adiposity measurements were calculated without including the child's head to minimise the effect of head movement on the measurement. Regression models were built using CpG methylation as the predictor and child's adiposity measurement (at 4 or 6¬†years) as the outcome, and of conditional abdominal circumstance growth velocity from 34¬†weeks gestation to birth as the predictor and cord CpG methylation as the outcome. Models were adjusted for child's sex and age as appropriate for each time point. Offspring adiposity was measured as %fat and total fat in grams, converted to Z-scores to facilitate interpretation of the effect size, and methylation measurements as %; the regression coefficient can therefore be interpreted as the standard deviation change in %fat (or total fat) for each % change in methylation. Results are presented as regression coefficients (Œ≤), which represent the (mean) change in outcome for a one unit (%) change in methylation, and their associated p-values. Analyses for validation of the array results were carried out on the full range of data, without grouping.</p>
                <p>As there was a strong correlation between methylation of the individual CpGs within ANRIL, and because the number of tests carried out was modest in comparison with genome-wide approaches, Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate corrections for multiple testing would not be appropriate (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Goeman and Solari, 2014</xref>). Instead a data reduction approach was employed by investigating the correlations between methylation at the 9 CpG sites, identifying those which cluster together statistically, and choosing the CpG with the highest median absolute deviation (MAD) score to represent that cluster. In both the SWS and GUSTO cohorts, the clustering of CpGs sites was similar with CpGs 1‚Äì2, 3 4‚Äì8 clustering. The exception was CpG9, which clustered with CpG 4‚Äì8 in the SWS cohort but separately in the GUSTO cohort. We therefore used a clustering which was appropriate across both cohorts, and grouped the 9 CpG sites into 4 clusters CpGs 1‚Äì2, 3, 4‚Äì8 and 9, represented by CpGs 2, 3, 7 and 9.</p>
                <p>Linear regression was used to analyse associations between DNA methylation levels, gene expression and infant adiposity measures in the GUSTO cohort. DNA methylation and infant adiposity measures were adjusted for sex, ethnicity, maternal age, mode of delivery and cell type. Cell type was corrected for using cellular proportions estimated from a reference panel's cell-specific methylation dataset (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Houseman et al., 2012</xref>). Experimental batches were accounted for as a covariate. Similar linear regressions were done to assess the relationship between methylation and gene expression. All statistical analyses in the GUSTO cohort were performed in R (version 2.15.3).</p>
                <p>Linear regression was used to analyse association between DNA methylation levels and BMI in the Raine cohort. The distribution of BMI in this cohort was positively skewed and therefore log-transformed. Multivariate linear regression was adjusted for age and sex. Differences in cellular heterogeneity in blood was assessed Cell type.</p>

                <title>Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) at Birth Are Associated With Later Adiposity</title>
                <p>To identify perinatal epigenetic biomarkers associated with later adiposity, we carried out a discovery scan of DNA methylation in the promoters of all refseq genes in umbilical cord DNA, comparing locus specific DNA methylation levels at birth with differences in percentage (%) fat mass in the children aged 6¬†years (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A; Table S2). Methylated DNA was captured using the methyl-binding domain (MBD) of MBD2, before the enriched methylated DNA fraction and input DNA was hybridised to the Agilent Human Promoter Whole-Genome array (G4489A). DNA methylation levels were estimated, adjusting for CpG density, using the validated algorithm BATMAN (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Down et al., 2008</xref>). This identified 93 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with %fat mass in the children at 6¬†years of age measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Table S3). The top pathway enriched amongst the 93 DMRs was DNA replication and repair (p¬†=¬†1¬†√ó¬†10<sup>‚àí¬†41</sup>) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, Table S4); 41 of the 93 DMRs were associated with this pathway. The DNA replication and repair pathway included DMRs linked with Cyclin dependent Kinase 2A inhibitor (<italic>CDKN2A</italic>), cyclin D (<italic>CCND1</italic>), flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (<italic>FEN1</italic>), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (<italic>PCNA</italic>) and A-kinase anchor protein 8 (<italic>AKAP8</italic>) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Cell cycle regulators have been increasingly linked to the control of metabolism. The cell cycle inhibitors p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4) and P14<sup>ARF</sup> (alternative reading frame relative to p16), encoded by the CDKN2A locus, have been shown to play a direct role in regulating adipocyte number, function and senescence (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abella et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore multiple GWAS studies have identified the CDKN2A locus, particularly the region encoding the long non-coding RNA ANRIL which negatively regulates p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, as a hotspot for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and frailty. However to date there have been no studies linking the differential methylation of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> or ANRIL with adiposity. We therefore further explored the association between the differentially methylated region within the CDKN2A locus at birth and child's %fat mass.</p>

                <title>Lower <italic>CDKN2A</italic> Methylation is Associated With Increased Child Adiposity</title>
                <p>Analysis of the promoter array revealed an association between lower methylation of the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR at birth and higher %fat mass age 6-years (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A‚ÄìB). The association remained after array-wide adjustment for surrogate variables (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Leek et al., 2012</xref>) (a procedure similar to that of <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Houseman et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that cellular heterogeneity did not confound the association (Table S5). To validate the relationship between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation and %fat mass age 6-years, sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing was carried out across the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR in an independent group of infants from the SWS cohort (n¬†=¬†247). The correlation between observed DNA methylation values at the 9 CpG dinucleotides were examined: two clusters of contiguous CpGs with highly correlated methylation levels (spearman rho¬†&gt;¬†0.68) could be determined within the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR, CpGs 1‚Äì2 and CpGs 4‚Äì8 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A), Within these two clusters the CpGs with the highest median absolute deviation (MAD) score, CpG 2 and CpG 7, were selected as the representative CpG for those clusters in further analysis (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). As CpGs 3 and 9 showed some divergence from their neighbors they were tested individually.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR at birth and adiposity in childhood.

                <p><italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation was associated with DXA measures of adiposity at 4 and 6¬†years of age, but not at birth; to examine this temporal difference in associations, we related perinatal <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation to triceps skinfold thickness, measured immediately after birth and at age 1-year. There was no association between DMR methylation and triceps skinfold thickness at birth, but an inverse association between methylation of CpG clusters 1‚Äì2, 3 and 4‚Äì8 with triceps skinfold thickness at age 1-year (p¬†=¬†0.039, p¬†=¬†0.068 and p¬†=¬†0.014 respectively) (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>A).

Analysis of GUSTO methylation levels at the nine CpGs showed a similar pattern of relatedness amongst CpGs (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). There was an even more divergent methylation profile at CpG9, suggesting the four test variables consisting of the two CpGs representative of larger contiguous correlated clusters and the two individual CpGs were appropriate across cohorts (Fig. S1C). Lower methylation of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> CpG cluster 3 (p¬†=¬†0.004), was associated with greater triceps skinfold thickness at age 7-days (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>B), while associations or trends were also seen between lower methylation of CpG 3 (p¬†=¬†0.004), and 9 (p¬†=¬†0.08) and higher subscapular skinfold thickness at age 7¬†days, and between lower methylation of CpG 9 (p¬†=¬†0.005) and greater ponderal index at age 18¬†months (Table S8), after adjustment for sex, maternal age, ethnicity, mode of delivery and cell type.</p>

                <p>Having found an association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation in DNA from peripheral tissues and measures of adiposity, we next investigated whether these same CpG loci were differentially methylated in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese compared to lean adults from the BIOCLAIMS cohort (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioclaims.uib.eu" id="ir0010">http://bioclaims.uib.eu</ext-link>) (Table S11). %fat mass was used to characterize subjects as lean (12.2‚Äì20.9% for males and 17.3‚Äì31.5% for females) or obese (26.8‚Äì38% for males, 36.8‚Äì52% for females).

                <p>As the identified DMR is in close proximity to the transcriptional start site of ANRIL and within the first exon of p14<sup>ARF</sup>, we investigated whether the DMR CpG sites may play a role in directly regulating the expression of ANRIL and/or p14<sup>ARF</sup>. The promoter region of ANRIL (‚àí¬†1281¬†bp to +¬†20¬†bp relative to TSS) and the 5‚Ä≤ portion of the p14<sup>ARF</sup> gene (‚àí¬†500¬†bp to +¬†1125¬†bp relative to TSS) were fused to the reporter gene Luciferase in the vector pGL3basic, and CpG sites 2, 3, 7 and 9 individually mutated (CpG¬†&gt;¬†TpG) then transfected into the liposarcoma cell line SW-872. Mutation of each of the 4 CpG sites decreased ANRIL promoter activity (all p¬†‚â§¬†0.008) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B).

                <title>DNA Methylation Alters Protein Complex Binding Within the DMR</title>
                <p>Having shown that CpG loci associated with adiposity can influence the level of ANRIL and p14<sup>ARF</sup> promoter activity, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to determine whether methylation affected transcription factor binding to this region. The region containing the CpGs of interest was sub-divided into four regions based upon CpG chromosomal position. Incubation of nuclear extracts from SW-872 liposarcoma cells with oligonucleotides covering CpG1, CpGs 2‚Äì3, CpGs 4‚Äì7 and CpGs 8‚Äì9 revealed protein binding to each of the four regions, with binding to the oligonucleotides CpGs 2‚Äì3 and CpGs 4‚Äì7 competed out by an excess of unlabeled specific competitor (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). To determine whether methylation at the CpG 2‚Äì3 site affected binding to this sequence, an oligonucleotide containing CpGs 2‚Äì3 was incubated with nuclear extracts from liposarcoma cells with 50, 100 and 500-fold excess of either the unmethylated or methylated specific competitor containing a methylated cytosine at CpG2. While binding to the probe was markedly reduced in the presence of a 500-fold excess of the unmethylated specific competitor, only a 50-fold excess of the methylated specific competitor was required to effectively compete out binding (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D), suggesting that methylation at CpG2 enhances DNA-protein binding. This marked increase in affinity of the protein complex for the methylated sequence was also observed when radiolabelled methylated probe was incubated with increasing concentrations of the unmethylated or methylated competitors (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E).</p>

                <title>The CpG 2‚Äì3 Region Contains an Estrogen Response Element</title>
                <p>To identify the complex binding across CpGs 2‚Äì3, multiplexed competitor EMSAs were carried out. Multiplexed oligonucleotide DNA consensus sequences for eighty common transcription factors (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Humphries, 2009</xref>) were used as competitors against the CpG 2‚Äì3 probe to identify potential transcription factors that may bind within the region. The protein complex bound across CpGs 2‚Äì3 was effectively competed out by the ERŒ± consensus binding sequence. Consistent with this, addition of the CpG 2‚Äì3 unlabelled competitor successfully competed out binding to radiolabelled ERŒ± probe (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F). DNA sequence analysis of this region revealed the core consensus sequence (GGGTCACCCTCTCCC) for an ERŒ± Estrogen Response Element (ERE) immediately downstream of the CpG 2‚Äì3 region matching known ERE conformations (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Kinsella, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Shu et al., 2010</xref>), and an upstream AT rich sequence, known to be important for ERŒ± binding (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Anolik et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>G). To examine if estrogen can effect ANRIL expression, SW872 cells were treated with 10¬†nM Œ≤-Estradiol (E2) for 72¬†h. E2 treatment induced a 4-fold increase in expression of unspliced ANRIL (p¬†=¬†0.008).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Differential methylation of specific CpG loci within the promoter region of ANRIL at the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene locus was predictive of measures of adiposity in four independent cohorts. In the UK SWS cohort (n¬†=¬†247), umbilical cord <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation was negatively associated with %fat mass at ages 4 and 6-years, in the Singapore GUSTO cohort (n¬†=¬†305), it was negatively associated with skinfold thickness or ponderal index at ages 7¬†days and 18¬†months, in the Australian RAINE cohort (n¬†=¬†814), whole blood <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation was negatively associated with concurrent BMI in 17¬†year olds and in the UK BIOCLAIMS cohort (n¬†=¬†81) obese individuals had lower adipose tissue <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation compared to lean individuals. Although the negative association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation and adiposity measures was observed across the 4 cohorts, in 3 tissues and 3 age groups, there were differences in the nature of the relations. In the SWS cohort, lower umbilical cord <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR methylation predicted increased adiposity at ages 1, 4 and 6¬†years but not at birth, suggesting that <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation may be linked to the gain of fat mass postnatally. Two developmental pathways to obesity have been suggested, one associated with fetal undernutrition, followed by rapid postnatal weight gain, while the second pathway is linked to fetal overnutrition and greater fat mass at birth (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Crozier et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Crozier et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, fetal growth faltering in late gestation was associated with lower <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation at birth, suggesting that <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation may be a marker for the former pathway. In the GUSTO cohort, there were associations between the methylation of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> with measures of adiposity from 7¬†days after birth. The timing of the associations between the cohorts may reflect differences in fat deposition or rate of body fat accumulation between birth and early infancy, potentially due to genetic and epigenetic ancestral differences between the different cohorts that can affect timing of associations. The associations between the methylation of the individual CpGs within the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR and adiposity were also not identical across the cohorts. The methylation status of CpG sites is often closely aligned to that of their neighbors, however developmentally induced changes are often CpG site specific (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Lillycrop et al., 2008</xref>). In the DMR examined, the CpGs were divided into distinct groupings based upon strong inter-correlation, but these groupings had distinct differences between them, suggestive of tissue or population differences. This is re-iterated by the EMSAs, which showed that different protein complexes bind across the CpG sites within the DMR, suggesting they are likely to be differentially regulated. This is also supported by the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, which showed that mutagenesis of the individual CpG sites had differential quantitative effects on expression.</p>
              <p>An inverse association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation in umbilical cord and measures of adiposity was observed in the SWS and GUSTO cohorts. Surrogate variable analysis to control for cellular heterogeneity in cord tissue had little effect on our findings suggesting that, in cord, differences in <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation are not dependent upon variation in cellular heterogeneity. An inverse association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation and obesity was found in adipose tissue from adults, suggesting that differential <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation may be a robust marker of adiposity across cord and adipose tissue. The negative association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation and BMI was again observed in peripheral blood samples from the RAINE cohort. Blood is a heterogeneous material with dynamic cellular proportions and DNA methylation is differential across cell types, making it challenging to resolve the causal relationships between methylation of whole tissue, cellular mix and phenotype. Cellular proportions were measured in the RAINE cohort, however in this (Table S11A) and other studies, cellular proportions strongly associate with BMI. As would be expected methylation levels also differ across cell types (Table S11B). Multicollinearity was seen between all cell types and log BMI for all CpG clusters within the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR. Therefore adjustment of the association between methylation and BMI for cellular proportions would violate the assumption of non-collinearity implicit in regression analysis. Consequently, we were unable to assess the dependence on cellular heterogeneity of the association of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation in blood and BMI, and therefore cannot exclude differences in cellular composition as the explanation for the association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation in peripheral blood and adiposity in late adolescence. However; the existence of this association in very different tissues, which are (in the case of adipose) more homogenous in their cellular composition, and the fact that in umbilical cord it survived adjustment for cellular heterogeneity, suggests that the relationship is not completely explained by the confounding influence of cell type.</p>
              <p>The <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene locus encodes for p14<sup>ARF</sup>, p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, and the long non-coding RNA <italic>ANRIL,</italic> which negatively regulates p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. p16<sup>INK4a</sup> inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 activity, which regulate the RB-E2F axis and cell cycle progression (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson and Landberg, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abella et al., 2005</xref>), while p14<sup>ARF</sup> also induces cell cycle arrest through its interaction with MDM2, resulting in increased p53 levels that trigger cell cycle arrest at both G1 and G2/M phases (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Pomerantz et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). Both p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p14<sup>ARF</sup> also play roles in driving cellular senescence and ageing (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Sharpless, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Matheu et al., 2009</xref>). There is also evidence that the p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-cdk4-pRB axis plays a direct role in metabolic regulation and adipocyte differentiation (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Aguilar and Fajas, 2010</xref>). Recent studies of genetically engineered mice deficient in E2F1, cdk4, and pRB, have shown that they contribute to lipid synthesis, glucose production, insulin secretion, and glycolytic metabolism. For example, adipose tissue-specific inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein induced increased mitochondrial activity, resulting in increased energy expenditure, which protected from diet-induced obesity (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Dali-Youcef et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, inactivation of cdk4, which controls the clonal expansion phase of adipogenesis and phosphorylates PPARŒ≥, blocked adipocyte differentiation, while a Cdk4 mutant, which cannot be inhibited by p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, increased the adipogenic potential of 3T3-L1 cells (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abella et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
              <p>Data from the BLUEPRINT epigenome project suggests that the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR overlaps with regulatory sequences. In monocytes, the DMR lies within a DNase hypersensitive peak and is associated with H3K27me3, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 marks. The existence of both repressive and activating histone marks suggests that a bivalent domain is located across the region, while in B cells and HUVECs, there is a peak of H3Kme1, a mark often enriched at enhancers or regulatory sequences. Consistent with sequences within the DMR having a functional role in the regulation of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> directed transcription, in the GUSTO cohort, where both DNA and RNA were available from the cord tissue, there were associations between the methylation of CpG cluster 4‚Äì8 and CpG 9 and the expression of the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> generated transcripts, suggesting that differential CpG methylation within the promoter of ANRIL may have downstream effects on p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p14<sup>ARF</sup> expression. Here, lower CpG methylation was associated with a decrease in ANRIL expression and an increase in p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and P14<sup>ARF</sup> expression. Increases in p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p14<sup>ARF</sup> expression would be expected to lead to a decrease in cell proliferation and increased cellular senescence; if re-capitulated in adipocytes, this could promote both a decrease in adipocyte number and impaired adipocyte function, since p16<sup>INK4a</sup> regulates cdk4 activity, which in turn phosphorylates and activates the adipogenic transcription factor PPARŒ≥. Interestingly the region encoding ANRIL has been identified by GWAS as a hot spot for genetic variation associated with a number of ageing associated diseases, such as CVD and T2D. Sequence alterations within ANRIL may similarly affect p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression with downstream effects on cellular senescence, impairing the regenerative potential of cells, and increasing susceptibility to ageing associated diseases. Whether differential methylation of this promoter region of ANRIL or other CpGs sites further upstream also associated with an altered susceptibility to other ageing associated diseases is, as yet, unclear. Thus, these findings suggest that both genetic and epigenetic alterations within ANRIL may have important consequences for future disease risk.</p>
              <p>In liposarcoma cells, we found that site directed mutagenesis of CpG sites affected ANRIL and p14<sup>ARF</sup> promoter activity respectively, and although mutation of a CpG site does not infer that methylation of the CpG would have the same effect, it does clearly suggest that these CpG sequences are important determinants regulating ANRIL and p14<sup>ARF</sup> expression. Binding of specific protein complexes to sequences within the DMR was also observed in liposarcoma cells, with methylation of CpG 2 increasing protein binding. DNA methylation has generally been associated with reduced transcription factor binding (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Tate and Bird, 1993</xref>), but there is now growing evidence that DNA methylation can also enhance transcription factor binding (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Clarke-Harris et al., 2014b</xref>). Interestingly, multiplexed competitor EMSAs identified ERŒ± binding across CpGs 2‚Äì3. ERŒ± plays an important role in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, with ERŒ± perturbation linked to the metabolic syndrome (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Hevener et al., 2015</xref>). ERŒ± is highly expressed in adipose tissue (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Mizutani et al., 1994</xref>), and a reduction in expression is linked to adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in both sexes (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2013</xref>). We found that treating liposarcoma cells with estrogen stimulated expression of ANRIL, and reduced p14<sup>ARF</sup> expression. While it remains unclear if ANRIL or p14<sup>ARF</sup> are direct targets of ERŒ± <italic>in vivo</italic> or part of the pathway by which ERŒ± influences adipocyte function, our experiments do suggest that lower DMR methylation would decrease ERŒ± binding and increase adiposity, consistent with studies showing increased adiposity in ERŒ± knock out mice and that ANRIL may be an important component of this pathway.</p>
              <p>Limitations of this study relate to the lack of cord, blood and adipose tissue from the same individuals, so we cannot extrapolate how <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation in cord tissue may relate to the methylation of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> in adipose or blood in the same individual, and/or whether such epigenetic alterations are causally involved in the development of fat mass. <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation was also measured in the 4 cohorts at different ages making exact comparisons between the cohorts more difficult, but the fact that a consistent negative association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation and measures of adiposity was seen across tissues types and ages suggest that differential methylation of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> may be a robust marker of adiposity.</p>
              <p>Interactions of genotype and <italic>in utero</italic> environment best explain the majority of inter-individual differences in umbilical cord DNA methylation (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Teh et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation levels may be specified by an interaction of infant genotype with <italic>in utero</italic> environment or genotype alone (known as a methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL). MethQTLs are overwhelmingly found <italic>in cis</italic> and the peak enrichment for SNP to CpG distance is within 45¬†bp (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al., 2010</xref>). We excluded all known SNPs within the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> DMR (encompassing¬†&gt;¬†45¬†nt) by direct sequencing; without genome-wide sequencing it is not possible to exclude effects or epistatic interactions of distant SNPs, but the inter-individual variations in <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation are most likely to be a product of differential <italic>in utero</italic> environments, perhaps in interaction with individual genotype.</p>
              <p>Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that SNPs in the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus (typified by rs10757274) and encompassed by ANRIL, but 94¬†KB downstream of the DMR discussed in this paper, were associated with increased susceptibility to frailty, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes and late onset Alzheimer disease (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Melzer et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Cunnington et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Grarup et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Zeggini et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Broadbent et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Congrains et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly the genetic associations seem independent of obesity (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Broadbent et al., 2008</xref>). Disease associated genotype is also associated with ANRIL expression levels, and ANRIL expression also differs relative to disease (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Shanker et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bochenek et al., 2013</xref>). Previously <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al. (2012)</xref> found that methylation in blood at a locus overlapping with the DMR discussed here, was higher in coronary artery disease compared to controls but methylation was not associated with genotype at rs10757274 (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2012</xref>). This leads us to speculate that both rs10757274 risk genotype and prenatal environment mediated by differential methylation independently affect ANRIL expression to mediate disease risk.</p>
              <p>The finding of a consistent association between <italic>CDKN2A</italic> methylation at birth and later adiposity in Caucasian and Asian cohorts at loci relevant to gene function provides substantial support for a role for epigenetics in mediating the long-term consequences of the early life environment on health, and suggests that altered methylation of CpG loci within the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus provide a robust prognostic marker of adiposity trajectory. Moreover these findings suggest a role for the long non-coding RNA ANRIL in the developmental origins of obesity, and identify estrogen as a novel regulator of ANRIL expression.</p>
