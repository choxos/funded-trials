                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Promoting healthy eating and active play in early life is critical, however few interventions have been delivered or sustained at scale. The evaluation of interventions at scale is a crucial, yet under-researched aspect of modifying population-level health behaviours. INFANT is an evidence-based early childhood healthy lifestyle intervention that aims to improve parents’ knowledge and skills around promoting optimal energy balance-related behaviours that, in turn, influence children’s diet, activity and adiposity. It consists of: 1) Four group sessions delivered via first time parent groups across the first 12 months of life; 2) access to the My Baby Now app from birth to 18 months of age. This research aims to assess real-world implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of INFANT when delivered at scale across Victoria, Australia.</p>

                  <title>Methods and Analysis</title>
                  <p>A hybrid type II implementation-effectiveness trial applying a mixed methods design will be conducted. INFANT will be implemented in collaboration with practice and policy partners including maternal and child health services, population health and Aboriginal health, targeting all local government areas (n=79) in Victoria, Australia. Evaluation is based on criteria from the ‘Outcomes for Implementation Research’ and ‘RE-AIM’ frameworks. Implementation outcomes will be assessed using descriptive quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews with those involved in implementation, and include intervention reach, organisational acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, cost, feasibility, penetration and sustainability. Process measures include organizational readiness, fidelity, and adaptation. Effectiveness outcomes will be assessed using a sample of INFANT participants and a non-randomized comparison group receiving usual care (1,500 infants in each group), recruited within the same communities. Eligible participants will be first time primary caregivers of an infant aged 0-3 months, owning a personal mobile phone and able to communicate in English. Effectiveness outcomes include infant lifestyle behaviours and BMIz at 12 and 18 months of age.</p>

                  <title>Impact</title>
                  <p>This is the first known study to evaluate the scale up of an evidence based early childhood obesity prevention intervention under real world conditions. This study has the potential to provide generalisable implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence to inform the future scale up of public health interventions both in Australia and internationally.</p>

              <title>1 Introduction</title>
              <p>The prevention of obesity in early life is a key priority identified by the World Health Organization (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The dietary and activity (energy-balance) behaviours associated with overweight and obesity begin in and track from early childhood (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In Australia, a minority of children meet dietary, physical activity or sedentary behaviour guidelines (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Children experiencing rapid weight gain during the first two years of life are also nearly four times more likely to become overweight or obese later in life (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Globally, an estimated 41 million children aged under five are affected by overweight or obesity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), including nearly one quarter of Australian children aged 2-4 years (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Addressing energy balance behaviours in early life is therefore critical (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
              <p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity, and the energy balance behaviours that predict them, are culturally, geographically and socioeconomically patterned (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) such that the most disadvantaged are disproportionately affected (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It is estimated that obesity and dietary risks are each responsible for approximately 15% of the gap in disease burden between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous Australians (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Preventive interventions must therefore reach families across social, cultural and geographic divides. Most population-based interventions to improve children’s health behaviours in early life occur <italic>via</italic> settings, such as child care. These do not reach most children in their first year of life, where the risks for later overweight and obesity begin. At this time, the main influences on children’s health behaviours are the family and home environment (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) with a key avenue for reaching parents through Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services.</p>
              <p>In Australia, routine universal MCH services are provided in all Australian states and territories. In Victoria, Australia, this service includes 10 free ‘key age and stage’ consultations with a MCH nurse (nine occurring between birth and two years of age) with a strong focus on promoting optimal child development and growth (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). More than 95% of Victorian parents attend these consultations between birth and four months, with over 80% still attending at 12 months (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Routine preventive care services, such as those provided through MCH services, therefore offer a circumscribed opportunity to support parents in the establishment of healthy behaviours during infancy and early childhood.</p>
              <p>The Infant feeding activity and Nutrition Trial (INFANT) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) tested the efficacy of a group-based intervention delivered via established first time parents<italic>’</italic> groups by universal MCH services. The intervention aimed to improve parents<italic>’</italic> knowledge and skills around promoting healthy eating and active play, and in turn, healthy growth from the start of life (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The intervention was underpinned by the principles of anticipatory guidance and social support and was first delivered in the trial by trained dietitians. Six 1.5-2hour face-to-face group sessions with parents and infants were delivered at 3 monthly intervals when the infant was approximately 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months of age. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed INFANT achieved high acceptance, with 70% of participants attending ≥ four of six sessions over 15 months and 85% reporting high usefulness (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). While the RCT did not impact standardised body mass index (BMIz) or physical activity (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), it did demonstrate positive child outcomes at 18 months for television viewing and dietary quality (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), with additional benefits for children of younger and less educated mothers (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Additional positive outcomes were observed for mothers<italic>’</italic> own dietary patterns and feeding practices (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Importantly, despite no further intervention beyond 18 months of age, the impact of INFANT remained evident up to 5 years of age for several targeted child health behaviors but not adiposity (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It is important to note that as with most research trials, participants were predominantly well educated (54% had a university education or higher) and English speaking (94% spoke English as the main language at home). No data was collected on participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families but it is likely they were under represented in the trial.</p>
              <p>While evidence is accumulating in support of efficacious early life childhood obesity prevention interventions such as INFANT (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), few studies have examined the effectiveness of these interventions when implemented at scale, in a real-world context. Further, implementation evidence including information on reach (particularly amongst hard to reach groups), feasibility, acceptability, scalability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness as well as sustainability are also lacking but vital to decision makers (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This was reflected in a recent research prioritization exercise with child obesity prevention researchers, policy makers and practitioners who identified ‘implementation science’ and ‘how to integrate child obesity prevention into existing service structures’ as key priorities (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
              <p>Interventions that can be integrated into existing delivery systems are more likely to be sustainable than resource intensive interventions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). INFANT represents a low intensity intervention with the potential for wide scale integration into service delivery structures. In Victoria, Australia, INFANT is now promoted as a flagship state-wide intervention delivering on two priority areas within the Victorian Public Health and Well Being Plan (2019-23) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and is endorsed as an evidenced based program nationally by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. This provides an opportunity to evaluate the usefulness of implementation strategies and overall intervention effectiveness when delivering INFANT at scale in a real-world context.</p>

                <title>2.2 INFANT Enhancements for Scale Up</title>
                <p><xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> provides an overview of the evolution of INFANT from efficacy testing to state wide scale up. Small scale translation of INFANT across eight Victorian LGAs between 2011-2016 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) identified a number of barriers to real-world implementation and scale up. These included a high organisational administrative burden coordinating and scheduling group sessions; challenges faced by facilitators in attending face-to-face training; limited staff time and confidence for evaluation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); parents’ earlier return to work (between 9-12 months as opposed to 15-18 months in the original trial); and parental preference for online supplementary information (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These findings have informed a number of enhancements to INFANT to improve scalability. These include the provision of online facilitator training, accessible to MCH nurses, dietitians and other health professionals; a reduction in INFANT group sessions from six to four (3, 6, 9, 12 months) to accommodate parents’ earlier return to work; and the development of the My Baby Now app (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The app provides evidence-based information and support from birth to 18 months of age including two to three age-appropriate push notifications per week to reinforce INFANT key messages (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text"><bold>Box 1</bold></xref>; <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary File 1</bold></xref>). The information from the trial (originally provided <italic>via</italic> handouts and a DVD) has been incorporated into the app, including information from sessions five and six offered at 15 and 18 months in the original trial. Additional information on milk feeding, including a new key message ‘feeding is a learning curve’, was also added to the app and program resources. An overview of the INFANT group sessions and key features of the My Baby Now app are provided in <xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Files 2</bold></xref><bold>,</bold>

                <p>To reflect the move from trial phase to scale up, the acronym INFANT was changed from ‘Infant feeding activity and nutrition trial’ to INfant Feeding, Active play and NuTrition. Health services will be encouraged to offer the app from birth aligned with routine services and through INFANT group sessions starting at 3 months of age. Promotion of the app will be <italic>via</italic> flyers and posters in health services, and SMS and referral during MCH key age and stage consultations. Enrolment of parents to the group sessions will be <italic>via</italic> existing systems for group programs locally. In the original RCT, this involved inviting first time parent groups to continue to meet for INFANT sessions. In the small-scale translation study, areas continued to use this approach, with some making the last session of the first-time parent group (usually when infants were around three months old) the first INFANT session. This opt-in model of enrolment was identified as promoting intervention uptake with parents (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>

                  <p>INFANT will be implemented in collaboration with eight practice and policy partners including key agencies involved in MCH service delivery, population health and Aboriginal health. Partners will integrate the promotion and endorsement of INFANT to all Victorian LGAs (n=79), leveraging routine communication channels (e.g., statewide newsletters) and via presentations from the research implementation team at existing meetings of service providers. Health services seeking to adopt INFANT will express interest via the INFANT website (infantprogram.org) and be guided through the sign-up process by the research implementation team. Cultural and linguistic adaptations to meet the needs of multi-cultural and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families within Victoria will be explored with relevant peak representative organizations as a sub-project, to be reported elsewhere.</p>

Organisational staff eligible to facilitate INFANT include MCH nurses, dietitians, community health workers or nominated personnel. INFANT implementation training comprises eight hours of free online training, providing guidance on all aspects of INFANT implementation and facilitation, with a focus on how to deliver group sessions and integration within existing delivery systems to maximise adoption and sustainability. The training includes case studies of successful implementation, an online discussion forum to promote peer networking (moderated by research staff), and interaction with the research implementation team to develop an implementation plan (a blueprint for local implementation). Following implementation training, health services will be eligible to have their trained staff deliver INFANT with yearly renewal contingent on facilitators completing a short online annual refresher course. Trained facilitators will be provided with online access to all resources including a facilitator and implementation manual as well as parent handouts (downloaded as pdfs) and the My Baby Now app.</p>

Facilitators will also be invited to complete a short online survey immediately post-training to provide feedback on the training course. Organisational readiness questions will be embedded in the baseline, 12 and 24-months post training surveys to identify organisational level barriers to adoption, implementation and maintenance.

                  <p>An embedded non-randomised controlled trial will assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of INFANT when delivered at scale. The trial will involve comparing primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes between a group of INFANT participants (intervention arm) and a non-randomised comparison group recruited within the same communities prior to the implementation of INFANT (usual care arm). This approach enables comparison of outcomes between parents and infants exposed and not exposed to the intervention living in the same geographical areas and therefore sharing socio-demographic characteristics and having access to the same health services. The risk of bias will be reduced by replicating strategies for recruitment, follow-up and assessment in both trial arms and adjusting for unbalanced baseline characteristics. This trial design was deemed appropriate for assessing the effect of INFANT when implemented at scale in real-world conditions, enabling natural dissemination and uptake to be captured. A cluster randomized design with communities allocated to intervention or usual care was deemed not feasible because the prospect of being randomised to the control arm is likely to reduce participation. Within communities, the prospect of parent groups being randomised to a control arm is unethical (given the known efficacy of the intervention) and contamination between groups would be unavoidable. A stepped-wedge cluster randomised study design (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) was also considered but ruled out as randomisation of LGAs to an implementation time period may interfere with natural uptake under real world conditions.</p>

Assuming a conservative attrition rate of 33%, it is expected that complete data on 2,000 primary carer/infant dyads (1,000/arm) will be collected. The statistical software PASS version 14.0.9 (NCSS, LLC) was used for all power calculations, assuming that 190 first-time parent groups will run in each arm with an average number of 5.4 children with complete data per group and a coefficient of variability in group size of 0.32, as observed in the INFANT RCT (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) (α=0.05; two-sided tests). A target sample size of 1,000 infants per arm achieves 80% power to detect a mean difference between arms of at least 0.17 points in the lifestyle score ‘Discretionary food and screen time’ at 18 months [primary outcome; standard deviation within clusters (SD) =1.21, intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.048].

              <p>The evaluation of effective interventions delivered at scale is a crucial, yet under-researched aspect of changing population-level health behaviours and essential to reducing the evidence to practice and policy gap. Examining implementation and effectiveness outcomes concurrently using a hybrid implementation and effectiveness trial design however comes with a number of challenges. Recruitment to the effectiveness trial is contingent on sufficient uptake of INFANT by organisations which in turn is shaped by a wide range of contextual factors outside of the control of the research team. Hence implementation outcomes determine the feasibility of conducting an embedded effectiveness trial within the timeframes of the study. Designing such a trial is also methodologically challenging as traditional trial designs such as RCT, cluster RCTs and stepped-wedge designs, which require organisations to be randomized to control arms, can interfere with the natural uptake of the intervention under ‘real world conditions’. The use of a non-randomized design in this effectiveness trial is therefore not without its limitations but will be minimized by recruiting parents exposed and not exposed to the intervention living in the same communities, replicating strategies for recruitment, follow-up and assessment in both trial arms, and adjusting for unbalanced baseline characteristics.</p>
              <p>Successful, sustained implementation is likely due to a combination of factors, including the effectiveness of the intervention and the use of appropriate implementation strategies. An improved understanding of the interrelationship of these factors will therefore enable explicit and transparent decisions regarding intervention adoption, implementation and sustainability. To our knowledge, no obesity prevention interventions in early childhood have been implemented and evaluated at scale under real world conditions. The findings from this study will directly inform future delivery of INFANT in Victoria. It will also provide vital implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence to inform the adoption and sustained implementation of early childhood obesity prevention interventions both in Australia and internationally.</p>

              <title>4 Ethics And Dissemination</title>
              <p>This study has been approved by the Deakin University Human Ethics Research Committee (approval no: 2019-403), and is registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12620000670976). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participating implementation staff and parents. In recognition of the importance of research with Aboriginal communities being led by Aboriginal people, Aboriginal families will be the focus of a separate sub-project conducted in partnership with the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation and led by Aboriginal researchers. The protocol for this will be published elsewhere and subject to the NHMRC Guidelines for Ethical conduct in research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and communities [<uri xlink:href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/resources/ethical-conduct-research-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples-and-communities">https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/resources/ethical-conduct-research-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples-and-communities</uri>]. Any future protocol modifications will be submitted for ethics approval and discussed and agreed with the project advisory committee including all chief investigators and partners. While it is unlikely that this health promotion research presents any potential risks associated with participation, if any participant expresses individual concerns or issues related to this study that requires medical attention, the health service will follow their standard procedures. Organisational staff will notify the lead investigator to determine the course of action. Research staff and organisations involved in delivering INFANT will be asked to report any unintended consequences to the research team.</p>
              <p>Research findings will be disseminated in peer reviewed journals and at scientific and professional conferences. We will also aim to communicate the study findings at key practice and policy forums and using plain language summaries for participating parents, practice and policy stakeholders distributed <italic>via</italic> email and the program website infantprogram.org.</p>
