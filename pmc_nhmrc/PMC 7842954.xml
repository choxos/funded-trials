              <abstract>
                <p>We tested the effect of an annual caries preventive intervention, delivered by a fly-in/fly-out oral health professional team, with Indigenous children residing in a remote Australian community. Around 600 Indigenous children aged 5 to 17 years were invited to participate at baseline, of who 408 had caregiver consent. One hundred and ninety-six consented to the epidemiological examination and intervention (Intervention group) and 212 consented to the epidemiological examination only (Comparison group). The intervention, which occurred annually, comprised placement of fissure sealants on suitable teeth, and application of povidone-iodine and fluoride varnish to the whole dentition, following completion of any necessary restorative dental treatment. Standard diet and oral hygiene advice were provided. Caries increment (number of tooth surfaces with new dental caries) in both deciduous and permanent dentitions was measured at the 2-year follow-up. Comparison group children had significantly higher number of new surfaces with advanced caries in the permanent dentition than the Intervention group (IRR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.02–2.54; p = 0.04); with a preventive fraction of 43%. The effect of intervention remained significant with children in the Comparison group developing significantly more advanced caries lesions in the permanent dentition than the Intervention group children in the adjusted multivariable analysis (IRR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.03–4.71). Indigenous children exposed to the intervention had less increment in advanced dental caries in the permanent dentition than those not exposed to the intervention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Globally, oral diseases represent one of the most prevalent chronic conditions, this burden largely unchanged for 25 years [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Untreated oral disease increased by a billion people: 2.5 in 1990 to 3.5 billion in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2015, the global cost due to dental conditions was estimated at over half-a-trillion dollars [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The dominant downstream approach is making little impression on the burden of oral conditions at the population level. Upstream approaches of addressing fundamental social determinants and drivers of disease have enjoyed little traction.</p>
              <p>The 2012–14 National Child Oral Health Survey, Australia, showed that among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (hereinafter respectfully referred to as Indigenous children) in remote communities, the mean number of decayed, missing or filled surfaces (dmfs) in the deciduous dentition was 7.3, of which 5 were decayed. Almost two-thirds (64%) of remote-living Indigenous children experienced dental caries [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the permanent dentition, older remote Indigenous children had mean DMFS of 2.5, with 1.7 surfaces decayed; 59% with caries experience [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This burden is replicated in adult Australian Indigenous people; and across Indigenous communities globally [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>We previously reported the effectiveness of water fluoridation on dental outcomes in a remote Indigenous community in Far North Queensland [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Water supplies were fluoridated across the community in 2005. Prior to this, all school-going children were surveyed, demonstrating caries experience of 6- and 12-year-olds more than twice that of the Queensland average, and more than four-times greater than Australian children overall [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A follow-up survey in this community, in late 2012 by our research team, in which over 70% of known resident schoolchildren (n = 339) were examined, showed the dental caries status had improved significantly since the pre-water fluoridation survey [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Unfortunately water fluoridation ceased mid-2011.</p>
              <p>Because caries remained a major problem, and would likely worsen without water fluoridation, our team successfully engaged with the Indigenous community and gained funding to test the effectiveness and cost-benefit of a caries preventive intervention [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This involved selective placement of fissure sealants, swabbing the dentition with povidone-iodine and application of fluoride varnish (termed a ‘Big Bang’ intervention). These individual preventive interventions have been found effective in reducing caries incidence [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244927.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but the combined effect is uncertain. A comparison of fluoride varnish and fissures sealants in a randomized clinical trial showed no significant difference in the number of newly decayed teeth over 3 years [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A program comparing primary and secondary prevention (glass ionomer sealants and interim therapeutic restorations) and one primary prevention only (glass ionomer sealants) showed no significant difference in reducing total caries experience but new caries experience was slower in the former intervention [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While fissure sealants are retained for a reasonable time and usually do not require re-application, fluoride varnish and povidone-iodine are most effective when applied 2–3 times a year [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In resource-constrained communities this is unsustainable. The overall purpose of the study was to determine whether professional interventions known to be effective individually, but deliberately applied together for maximum effect, compared to care as usual, were associated with a decrease in caries incidence and were cost-effective. The aim in the analysis presented here was to assess the effectiveness of an annual intervention on caries increment at the 2-year follow-up. We hypothesised that children who received the intervention would experience significantly fewer new carious lesions compared to those who did not.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>Following extensive consultation with the community, it became apparent that a non-randomised trial would be the most culturally appropriate approach. Ethics approval was granted by Griffith University (GU Ref: DOH/05/15/HREC); Far North Queensland (FNQ HREC/15QCH/39-970); Department of Education and Training (Queensland Government) to approach participants at schools; and Torres and Cape Hospital and Health Service for Site Specific Approval. The research is registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000693527: 3rd July 2015). This study is reported following the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non-randomised Designs (TREND) guideline [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>A detailed protocol is published [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All (approximately 600) school-going children (aged 5–17 years) in the community were invited to participate, by virtue of a detailed information sheet with detachable consent form, to be signed by a parent or guardian. At baseline, in the year 2015, approximately two-thirds of the children (N = 408) consented to a head and neck, and oral epidemiological examination. For those in need of dental treatment, separate signed consents were obtained according to Queensland Health standard procedures. The preventive intervention, delivered by a fly-in clinical team, comprising placement of fissure sealants, application of povidone-iodine and fluoride varnish, followed completion of individual treatment plans. Incentive to participate was provision of a well-organised and easily accessible treatment program at a mobile unit located at one primary school and at the dental clinic in the hospital, which is within walking distance of the community high school. Transport was provided for children who attended the second primary school a few kilometres away. In 2015 a clinical team comprising a dentist, oral health therapists and dental assistants lived in the community for three months. A smaller clinical team visited at first follow-up. Of the 408 children, those who consented to dental treatment (if required) and to the preventive intervention comprised the Intervention group, while those who did not formed the Comparison group.</p>
              <sec id="sec003">
                <title>Outcome variable</title>
                <p>Dental caries status of children was assessed by four trained and calibrated examiners, using the International Caries Detection and Assessment system (ICDAS-II) [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Children were examined in specially set-up classrooms, using mobile, reclinable chairs with fixed- and head-LED lights. Disposable mouth mirrors and blunt probes were used, as was gauze control moisture. All examiners completed ICDAS-II online training. For inter-examiner agreement, 5% of children were re-examined by another examiner, and discrepancies discussed with the child present. Overall kappa was 0.84, indicating high agreement. The epidemiological team visited the community for ~3-weeks each year of the study—usually September/October after the Wet Season.</p>
                <p>Caries increment at the 2-year follow-up was the primary outcome. Any surface caries free at baseline examination (2015) but observed to have caries at the follow-up examination in 2017 was considered new caries/incident caries, and used for calculating caries increment (number of surfaces with new caries in each participant). Surfaces caries free at baseline but found to be extracted due to caries in subsequent examination, were also included when calculating caries increment, with all surfaces of an extracted tooth counted as missing. For analysis, caries increment was quantified for incipient (early stages of dental decay, identified as a white-spot lesion; ICDAS 1 and 2 scores) and moderate-advanced caries (ICDAS 3–6), separately and together (total caries increment) in the deciduous and permanent dentitions.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Summary statistics are presented for continuous data as either mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) as appropriate, and for categorical data as frequency (percentage). The association between group (Intervention/Comparison) and baseline characteristics was investigated using either the Mann-Whitney U test or the Chi-square test. For the outcomes—incipient caries increment, advanced caries increment and total caries increment—the preventive fraction was calculated as the percentage of the ratio of the difference between the mean increment in the Comparison and Intervention groups to the mean increment in the Comparison group. The preventive fraction is an estimate of the percentage of carious lesions able to be prevented if children belonged to the Intervention rather than the Comparison group.</p>
                <p>The association between group and caries increment was investigated using negative binomial regression models. In the initial model, group was included as the main effect and baseline caries experience as the covariable. Multivariable analyses with full adjustment for all covariables were conducted for the caries outcomes that demonstrated significant associations with group in the initial model. Covariables included in the adjusted models were age, sex, baseline caries experience, soft drink, lolly, syrup/jam, sugar consumption, salivary mutans streptococci and salivary LB levels. The negative binomial model was chosen due to the overdispersion of the outcome data, and the consequent inappropriateness of a Poisson model for this count data. Effect estimates are presented as Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Due to the study design, the primary analysis was undertaken on a per-protocol basis.</p>
                <p>To test the sensitivity of our results, we also completed an intention to treat (ITT) analysis. For the ITT analysis missing data was imputed using a fully condition-specification markov chain Monte Carlo method [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Data were assumed to be missing at random, ten iterations were used, and five imputed datasets were obtained. Variables with complete data (group and age) were also included in the model. Missing interval data was imputed using linear regression and missing binary data with logistic regression. Data were constrained by their minimum and maximum values. Both the initial (that is, with group and baseline caries experience included as main effects) and the adjusted model were calculated. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data analysis was undertaken using SPSS (IBM Corp. 2016. v24.0. Armonk, NY).</p>

              <p>The ITT analysis for caries increment in the permanent dentition demonstrated similar differences to the per protocol analysis, suggesting these results are robust. In particular, the Comparison group experienced greater advanced caries increment in the permanent dentition than the Intervention group. Comparison group children had significantly more advanced carious tooth surfaces in the permanent dentition compared to the Intervention group children (IRR = 1.61, 95%CI 1.20–2.17; p = 0.03) after adjusting for baseline caries experience (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244927.s003">S1 Table</xref>). This effect remained significant after controlling for all potentially confounding background characteristics (IRR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.18–2.23; p = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244927.s004">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

              <p>The intervention to treat all existing caries at baseline followed by a ‘Big Bang’ annual application of selective fissure sealants, povidone-iodine and fluoride varnish reduced the number of new tooth surfaces with advanced caries on the permanent dentition in the Intervention group compared to the Comparison group. At the 2-year follow-up, the caries preventive fraction due to the intervention ranged between 20% to 40% for all caries outcomes.</p>
              <p>Direct comparison of our findings to literature is difficult as investigation of annual application of interventions of this type, to our knowledge, does not exist. The three types of intervention applied have each been reported to individually have significant success in preventing dental caries [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, a recent report from a rural non-fluoridated community in Chile found bi-annual fluoride application not effective in preschool children [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A community-randomised controlled trial in Australian Aboriginal children did show that fluoride varnish was efficacious [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]: in this trial caries reduction was 2.3–3.5 surfaces/child with preventive fraction of 24–36%; similar to our findings. A trial in a remote Australian Indigenous community measuring the effectiveness of sliver fluoride for deciduous-dentition caries showed it as effective as the Atraumatic Restorative Technique (ART) [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>While our annual intervention reduced caries incidence, caries increment remains unacceptably high in this community, even in children who received it. These interventions are resource-intensive, so consideration should be given to proven cost-effective interventions such as the reintroduction of water fluoridation. If active interventions are needed, consideration should be given to expanding the roles of community health workers to deliver preventive programs, especially minimally invasive interventions such as povidone-iodine applications and fluoride varnish. In remote communities it would not be feasible or sustainable for these to be delivered by oral health professionals. If performed by trained community health workers, more regular applications as normally recommended would be feasible [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>Besides introducing active (professionally-applied) and passive (water fluoridation) interventions, it is of critical importance to address social determinants to reduce the burden of poor oral health [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is of serious concern in Indigenous communities, with increases occurring during adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Strategies to reduce sugar consumption include taxes on sugar and/or sugar-sweetened beverages [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and graphic warnings on labels [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is incumbent upon dental researchers, dental providers and policy-makers to advocate for public health interventions to address the upstream social determinants of health that have the most impact on the oral and general health [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>At this is a non-randomised trial, lacking a prospective randomised recruitment, assessing the true effect of the preventive intervention is compromised. The two groups for example showed pre-existing differences at baseline. Longitudinal studies, especially in remote settings, have limitations. One such is loss to follow-up of participants. In our community there are a number of reasons: obtaining parent/guardian consents is always challenging, not necessarily because there is opposition, often simply because carers cannot be located or motivated. Here, this was compounded by the need to obtain multiple signed consents: for epidemiological examinations; for application of our preventative intervention, for treatment planning examinations and for restorative treatments. Similarly, compliance to all stages of clinical contact is often poor, because students are absent from school or out of the community for social or family reasons. School absenteeism is common and it is an important goal of government to improve this [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In 2015, at baseline, school attendance was high as there was a community effort to encourage this. At follow-up visits this effort had waned and absenteeism was higher. Some children, especially later into their schooling, move to larger towns to complete their education. While we lost a number of children to follow up over the 2-years of the study, the findings from the per-protocol and ITT analysis showed no differences. While clinical examiners were not informed of the group status of children who attended follow-up, the presence of fissure sealants made blinding impossible. With each examination time point separated by a year, deciduous teeth that developed caries, but exfoliated and were replaced by permanent teeth between these time points would have underestimated caries increment in the deciduous dentition.</p>
              <p>While it is important to address the social determinants of health in Indigenous communities in Australia, it is critically important that at a national level there is progress on the broader issues of Indigenous disadvantage and dispossession of land and resources. Many argue for formal recognition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Nation’s constitution, for a formal treaty to acknowledge the impact of colonisation and a Makarrata: <italic>the coming together after a struggle</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0244927.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], all of which impact on oral health, oral health-related quality of life and overall health and well-being.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>Remote Indigenous children who received the annual preventive intervention experienced fewer incident advanced carious lesions in the permanent dentition at the 2-year follow-up, compared to children who did not receive this.</p>

              <p>Impact of a non-randomised caries preventive trial in remote Indigenous Australian children</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Prof Johnson,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. </p>
              <p>The manuscript has been assessed by three reviewers; their comments are available below.</p>
              <p>The reviewers find the subject of relevance but two of them have raised major methodological concerns about the study. The reviewers note concerns about the matching between groups and note that the fact that participants self selected into the intervention group may have introduced a major confounder, the reviewers also request sociodemographic information about the participants. The reviewers raise major concerns about the statistical analyses reported and note that the data should be re-analysed using different approaches.</p>
              <p>Could you please carefully revise the manuscript to address the concerns raised by the reviewers and submit a revised version of the manuscript for further consideration.</p>
              <p>Please note that the revised manuscript will need to undergo further review, we thus cannot at this point anticipate the outcome of the evaluation process.</p>
              <p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Dec 15 2019 11:59PM.

              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript addresses an interesting topic. The research questions are well-posed and the data contain a rich set of information. The employed statistical methods are very basic and not all the data features have been accounted properly. Some comments follow.</p>
              <p>1. The data are not fully available. This is not in line with the journal's guidelines. Moreover, this does not allow the reviewer to reproduce the results. This is particularly important as several sentence must be verified, e.g. the fact the mathcing is properly performed,"largely matched the characteristics of the comparison group" is quite a strong sentence if not supported by any evidence.</p>
              <p>2. As missing data arise, more details on the multiple imputation procedure should be provided, pointing out the potential bias and/or increase in the uncertainty (e.g. standard errors of the estimates) due to the imputation approach. As a general matter, an analysis of the imputed data should be provided. It is important to inspect the imputations. In general, a good imputed value is a value that could have been observed had it not been missing.</p>
              <p>3. A major concern refers to the analysis of the main outcome. The ICDAS classification leads to a categorical ordered variable. The use of a non-parametric test is sound, though reporting the "mean" is rather misleading. Moreover, the data are rich of information. A longitudinal data structure is available and completely neglected. A mixed effects model must be employed to better appreciate the differences between the groups, taking into account possible individual-specific confounders and a possible trend/growth effect. Heterogeneity may be quite an issue, in particular in small/medium sample size analyses as few observation may strongly affect inferential procedures.</p>
              <p>4. As a minor point, it is rather unclear why the Permanent surface and All surfaces values differ as they are computed on the same number of subject, with the All surfaces values that are often greater than the others.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #3: I would like to congratulate the authors and declare that I am very thankful for the opportunity to revise this manuscript. It is well designed, conducted and reported. This topic is extremely important to improve the public health politic for disadvantaged populations. However, some points should be improved:</p>
              <p>Previous studies have showed that initial noncavitated caries lesion have no higher risk of developing a severe increment in caries. Studies have also showed that many of these lesion arrest without a interevention by dentist. In this cases, the preventive politics should be considered in order to avoid frank dentin cavitation. Thus, the primary outcome should be focused in more severe caries lesion. Discussion should also be focused in results about moderate-advanced caries lesions.</p>
              <p>Furtheremore, the conclusion should be based only in the results. Speculations or ideas should be added in discussion section.</p>

              <p>Reviewer 1: Responses:</p>
              <p>The manuscript addresses an interesting topic. The research questions are well-posed and the data contain a rich set of information. The employed statistical methods are very basic and not all the data features have been accounted properly. Some comments follow. The full statistical analysis has been re-worked, based on detailed comments from both reviewers. Additional details of the changes are provided with the relevant comments.</p>
              <p>In summary the statistical analysis now focused on the 2-year follow-up, and the 1-year follow-up findings have been removed. The all surface (combination of two dentitions) have also been removed to avoid confusion. </p>
              <p>We have also removed the comparison of experimental group children who received one and two preventive intervention over the study period as this is also possibly confusing but also adds little value to the overall analyses conducted. </p>
              <p>We have now included the baseline comparison findings for the two groups.</p>
              <p>We have reported Medians (95% Confidence intervals) instead of Means (SDs).</p>
              <p>We have conducted and reported the per-protocol multivariate analysis to assess the effect of the intervention after adjusting for potential confounders, focusing on the important outcome (as suggested by reviewer 3) of advanced caries increment in the permanent dentition. </p>
              <p>We have replicated the per-protocol analysis on Intention to Treat (ITT) basis for both bivariate and multivariate analyses.</p>
              <p>The data are not fully available. This is not in line with the journal's guidelines. Moreover, this does not allow the reviewer to reproduce the results. This is particularly important as several sentence must be verified, e.g. the fact the mathcing is properly performed,"largely matched the characteristics of the comparison group" is quite a strong sentence if not supported by any evidence. Access to raw data will be considered on request. Because of cultural sensitivities these will be referred to the Griffith University Research Ethics Committee and the Community will be contacted for advice. </p>
              <p>A detailed table presenting the baseline comparison of the two groups is now included with supporting text in the Results section. </p>
              <p>As missing data arise, more details on the multiple imputation procedure should be provided, pointing out the potential bias and/or increase in the uncertainty (e.g. standard errors of the estimates) due to the imputation approach. As a general matter, an analysis of the imputed data should be provided. It is important to inspect the imputations. In general, a good imputed value is a value that could have been observed had it not been missing. Data from the imputed analysis are now included in the revised manuscript. Standard errors are presented in the multivariate analysis tables. </p>
              <p>A major concern refers to the analysis of the main outcome. The ICDAS classification leads to a categorical ordered variable. The use of a non-parametric test is sound, though reporting the "mean" is rather misleading. Moreover, the data are rich of information. A longitudinal data structure is available and completely neglected. A mixed effects model must be employed to better appreciate the differences between the groups, taking into account possible individual-specific confounders and a possible trend/growth effect. Heterogeneity may be quite an issue, in particular in small/medium sample size analyses as few observation may strongly affect inferential procedures. The outcome in this study was the incidence of new lesions, i.e., the count of incipient and advanced caries which developed on tooth surfaces that were caries free at baseline. Means were reported as it is easy to interpret. We have now reported medians with 95% CIs, as recommended. </p>
              <p>We have discussed conducting a mixed effects model with our resident statistics Professor who had some reservations in relation to use of mixed effects model on this data where the outcome is incidence (new lesions). A mixed effects model would undermine the use of valid incidence data by only considering the prevalence of dental caries at each timepoint. We have now conducted a negative binomial regression with log link and have taken into account potential confounders including baseline caries as suggested. </p>
              <p>As a minor point, it is rather unclear why the Permanent surface and All surfaces values differ as they are computed on the same number of subject, with the All surfaces values that are often greater than the others. Apologies, if we did not present this adequately. Yes, all surface values are greater than permanent surfaces as ‘all surfaces” is a sum of both deciduous and permanent surfaces. The mean of ‘all surfaces’ is dependent on deciduous and permanent surfaces but is not the total sum as the number of individuals with deciduous and permanent dentitions is not the same.</p>
              <p>We have however removed the all surface findings to avoid any confusion.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2: Responses:</p>
              <p>I would like to thank the authors and the editors for the chance to review this manuscript. Dental caries in high risk, hard to reach populations is a critical research area and one that this reviewer has particular interest in. As such, rigorous research is a welcome contribution. We thank the referee for his understanding and support </p>
              <p>The authors report on a non-randomized study of the combined effects of fluoride varnish and pit/fissure sealants for the prevention of dental caries in indigenous populations. The individual effectiveness of these agents in the prevention of caries is well known and has been thoroughly studied, as well as being formally recommended by multiple national agents for this purpose. The authors argue that the combined effects of these agents have not been evaluated, but I believe there are studies currently in operation that have still been studied. Some have investigated this combination both in clinical and pragmatic studies, though in varying forms (e.g., 10.1186/s12903- 018-0514-6; 10.1002/14651858.CD003067.pub4; 10.5005/jp-journals-10005-1491; 10.1016/j.adaj.2017.05.028), which may be useful to cite in the literature of the study. This reviewer knows also of two ongoing clinical trials looking at the impact of the combination of therapies, one arm of which is FV+sealants. The Introduction has been updated to include the suggested research evidence.</p>
              <p>That said, there is still need for further evidence of the combined effects of these agents in high-risk alternative populations. Thus, the overall scientific contribution from this type of research can be positive. The authors do a wonderful job of presenting their study in detail. However, there are substantial methodological concerns as described below that weakened enthusiasm for this manuscript. </p>
              <p>This reviewer disagrees with non-consenting children being considered a “natural” comparison group. They can be treated as a comparator but this language is, I believe, too confusing and similar to that of natural experiments. Further, I was unable to find a comparison (baseline or otherwise) between the consenting and non-consenting children. The obvious concern is that there are systematic differences in patients that consent and do not consent to the study. In fact, there seem to be no tables or results anywhere regarding the sociodemographic breakdown of the participants in either group. There is a sentence in results saying they “largely matched”, but there is no table and it needs to be shown. A detailed table presenting the baseline comparison of the two groups is now included with supporting text in the Results section.</p>
              <p>The outcome of caries incidence is complicated by exfoliation. The age group on the low end means there may have been instances wherein primary teeth were exfoliated during the study and should this data have been carious, it is biased. </p>
              <p> When caries incidence was computed only those missing due to caries were considered. i.e., we used ICDAS code 97. Examiners inquired if the tooth was missing due to caries. However, it is possible that inaccuracies can arise if deciduous teeth developed caries but exfoliate and are replaced by a permanent tooth between the examination time points. We have now included a statement on this as a limitation.</p>
              <p>I am confused by a sentence in results about extraction due to caries, I thought this was a program due to a lack of care access for the patient population (typical for this type of intervention). Yet children with carious lesions have access to extractions? Could the authors clarify?</p>
              <p> There is a public dental service available to the community, albeit limited, in the community and a distant island, only accessible by ferry. These services are however essentially for adults in the community, although children are treated, usually in emergencies. The number of teeth extracted during the study period should be small and not impact on the findings of the study. An accurate account of services received outside of the study would require a complex and lengthy (up to six to 12 months) approval process to receive. There is no private dental service in this community or nearby. </p>
              <p>Post hoc sample size calculation for power is generally not recommended. </p>
              <p> Thanks for recommendation, we have deleted this information. </p>
              <p>As the intervention was not randomized and the children effectively self-selected into the study intervention and comparator groups, it is unclear if the effect is true. E.g., if consenting children have greater wealth (as a simple example) or more attentive parents, the home environment may be more conducive to a healthier diet and/or hygiene behavior. This is probably the most problematic limitation. </p>
              <p> A detailed table presenting the baseline comparison of the two groups is now included with supporting text in the Results section.</p>
              <p>Please justify the MAR assumption.</p>
              <p> We performed Littles MCAR test with the p-values being significant for all the variables with the missing data. With the p-values being significant, the missing data could not be MCAR. We also compared the baseline characteristics between the dropouts and those completing the experiment to assess the dropout bias. There was no dropout bias and we cannot conceptualize any unobserved variables that could predict the missingness of the data in this population, particularly the outcome data. Therefore, MNAR is out of question. </p>
              <p>This leaves us with the assumption that the data is MAR. With the assumption of MAR, we have included all the variables that could be theoretically predictive of missing data while imputing the missing data as can be seen in the description in the statistical analyses. This is commonly accepted practice. </p>

              <p>The MW test is a fairly basic nonparametric test. Given the non-randomization of the design this can lead to serious concerns over confounding, and the authors did not seem to do any adjustment (e.g., propensity score matching or inverse probability weighting) to alleviate this concern. </p>
              <p> There is a plethora of literature supporting the use of regression analysis controlling the effect of confounding variables over matching. Also, matching is not as sensitive to the functional form of covariates as in regression. Therefore, we used multivariate regression to control the confounding. </p>

              <p>We have included the results from negative binomial regression analysis with log link. Adjustments were made for potential confounding variables including baseline caries experience. </p>
              <p>The reviewer cannot find tables on the baseline measures for caries between groups. A detailed table presenting the baseline comparison of the two groups is now included with supporting text in the Results section.</p>
              <p>There are a number of MWU tests performed here, yet no treatment or discussion is given to the possibly large experiment wise error rate. The authors should consider nonparametric regression or multivariate regression of transformed outcomes, which would also allow them to consider the varying sociodemographic variables in the model. Thanks for the suggestion. We have conducted a negative binomial regression analysis with log link with caries increment as the outcome variable. </p>
              <p>ITT and PPA was conducted, and the authors went with PPA, yet no justification is given. Due to the analyses being similar and due to space limitation, we opted to only present the PPA findings in the original submission. However, we have now presented both the PPA and ITT findings for the bivariate and multivariate analyses. </p>
              <p>Results: please provide confidence intervals. The authors note the non-normality of outcome data yet did not describe the severity of this departure. Given the MW test, the authors could use a Wilcoxon test CI for medians or log-transform their data and calculate a modified Cox confidence interval. These will be more useful than with P-values. We have now provided medians with 95% CIs. </p>
              <p>The authors should be careful of the use of “effective” and “effectiveness” given the nature of the design of the study. We have used the word “efficacious” where appropriate.</p>
              <p>In the Discussion, it is confusing to read a paragraph about SSBs. This reviewer understands that SSBs are a significant contributor to caries, but the authors’ reversal here to focus on social determinants when the paper was focused on care provision seems out of place. This is a small component of the Discussion, and we believe that emphasizing addressing the social determinants of dental caries is important; and have therefore retained this in the Discussion. </p>
              <p>One of the concerns in this report is the authors’ own admission that while sealants can be a “set it and forget it” intervention, general clinical recommendations include the multiple reapplication of fluoride varnish. The authors admit, understandably, that this is infeasible for the specific population, however this creates an issue with the interpretation of the results. It is unable to be identified whether the major preventive effect on the observed incidence of caries is due to the longer-lasting sealants, an atypical response to a single application of FV, or a combination of both. Ideally, this study would have had additional treatment groups for just FV and just sealants, but this absence means there is a notable limitation in the impact of the paper. It is not ethical to create another group for just FV and FS when it is evident that both are effective. The study would probably not have been funded and receive ethics approval if such a design was planned. This study design was planned with consideration to the sensitivities for conducting research in a remote Indigenous community. We have added:</p>
              <p>“ it must be emphasized that the purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy, and cost effectiveness, of professional interventions known to be effective individually, but deliberately applied together for maximum effect. The study is essentially a piece of health economics research: it was not designed to evaluate disinfectants, FV and sealants individually”.</p>
              <p>Overall, despite the nice design and excellent presentation of the manuscript, the methodological limitations lead the reviewer to believe it is not of a high enough standard for publication in PLOS One. As a non-randomized trial, one would expect to see more rigorous treatment of internal and external validity threats in analysis, but the (over)use of MWU tests was considered weak. Additionally, the self-selection of participants into treatment and control was also considered a major limitation. We have re-worked the full statistical analysis. Self-selection of participants is tied with the ethical approval and consent processes of the study.</p>
              <p>Research in remote Indigenous communities is challenging. Whilst we had strong support from Elders and local school and health care personnel, it is difficult to reach and engage every single family. A degree of pragmatism is required. We are convinced that we have made a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of these children and this is supported by our econ omics evaluation, currently in press.</p>

              <p>Responses:</p>
              <p>I would like to congratulate the authors and declare that I am very thankful for the opportunity to revise this manuscript. It is well designed, conducted and reported. This topic is extremely important to improve the public health politic for disadvantaged populations. However, some points should be improved: </p>
              <p>Previous studies have showed that initial noncavitated caries lesion have no higher risk of developing a severe increment in caries. Studies have also showed that many of these lesion arrest without a interevention by dentist. In this cases, the preventive politics should be considered in order to avoid frank dentin cavitation. Thus, the primary outcome should be focused in more severe caries lesion. Discussion should also be focused in results about moderate-advanced caries lesions. Well OK, and the res.t............</p>
              <p> We do separate incipient and advance caries increment in the analysis. The multivariate model only analyses advances caries increment in the permanent dentition.</p>
              <p>Furtheremore, the conclusion should be based only in the results. Speculations or ideas should be added in discussion section. The conclusion has been edited to focus on the findings, and speculations and ideas have been moved to the Discussion.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: I thank the authors for the replies to all my comments.</p>
              <p>I have two minor points to be further discussed.</p>
              <p>a. Some sensitivity analysis about the imputation data used must be included. How many imputed datasets did you consider? Of course, several must be considered.</p>
              <p>b. I appreciate the use of the negative binomial regression model. I feel that as you are modelling the new lesions, the inclusion of random effects is necessary to account for the longitudinal strucutre of the data.

              </p>
              <p>Our sincerest thank you to all the reviewers for their comments on our resubmission. Below we summarise our responses. Substantial changes based on the comments are highlighted in yellow in the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 1:</p>
              <p>Comment: I have two minor points to be further discussed.</p>
              <p>a. Some sensitivity analysis about the imputation data used must be included. How many imputed datasets did you consider? Of course, several must be considered.</p>
              <p>Response: This is included in the methods under the statistical analysis section, lines 157-158 on page 8 - ten iterations were used, and five imputed datasets were obtained.</p>
              <p>Comment: b. I appreciate the use of the negative binomial regression model. I feel that as you are modelling the new lesions, the inclusion of random effects is necessary to account for the longitudinal strucutre of the data. The book from Rainer Winkelmann "Econometric Analysis of Count Data" could be a good reference to get why random effects may be used. Of course, please provide the results of the likelihood ratio test to check if the random effects are needed or not.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for your suggestion. To account for the repeated measures nature of the data we have adjusted all regression models for caries experience at baseline. This has the effect on including both measurements of the outcome under investigation in the same model.</p>
              <p>Lines 144-153, page 7:</p>
              <p>“The association between group and caries increment was investigated using negative binomial regression models. In the initial model, group was included as the main effect and baseline caries experience as the covariable. Multivariable analyses with full adjustment for all covariables were conducted for the caries outcomes that demonstrated significant associations with group in the initial model. Covariables included in the adjusted models were age, sex, baseline caries experience, soft drink, lolly, syrup/jam, sugar consumption, salivary mutans streptococci and salivary LB levels. The negative binomial model was chosen due to the overdispersion of the outcome data, and the consequent inappropriateness of a Poisson model for this count data. Effect estimates are presented as Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).”</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2:</p>
              <p>Comment: In the introduction, the authors again used “efficacy” in one sentence and “effectiveness” in another. These are different concepts and, one could argue, both incorrect for the study as presented. Later on they say “impact”, when really all they can say in this study is association. </p>
              <p>Response: In the Introduction we have replaced ‘efficacy’ with association and “effectiveness” with impact. Effectiveness appears elsewhere in the manuscript, but these relate to the evidence reviewed.</p>
              <p>Comment: The nonconsenting children do not constitute a “natural comparison group”. This needs to be changed, and was mentioned in my previous review. </p>
              <p>Response: The word natural has been removed, the non-intervention group is now referred to as the Comparison group. </p>
              <p>Comment: It is a bit of a misnomer to call the treatment group the “experimental group”. It not as egregious as natural comparison but they should consider a different name. This is not an RCT. </p>
              <p>Response: We have changed the name of the “experimental group” to the Intervention group. </p>
              <p>Comment: This reviewer does not agree with the authors responses regarding their approach to confounding. First and foremost, I believe they are conflating typical regression adjustment for confounding with causal effects, particularly in their included citation of regression versus matching. Respectfully, that is not a statistical paper. Matching is meant to try to eliminate the potential selection bias by identifying all possible variables associated with the probability of treatment assignment, given the non-random assignment of the participants of the study. I would suggest the reviewers review Morgan &amp; Winship, “Counterfactuals and Causal Inference”, as well as Hernan and Robins, “Causal Inference”, for a thorough discussion regarding—and comparison of—matching, regression adjustment, and weighting in observational research. There are interesting chapters on each that would greatly help the authors in constructing the rationale for their methods and for conducting the analyses. I believe you will find, generally, that when simply using covariate adjustment the results are not as robust as another method (e.g., IPW-MSM, PSM, IV estimation, etc.)</p>
              <p>Response: Following the reviewer’s suggestions we have refined the language in this manuscript to emphasize that we are measuring the association between children who received the intervention and children who did not in terms of their caries experience, and are not attempting to make any claims regarding causal effects. For key outcomes we have presented both unadjusted effect estimates, and also effect estimates adjusted for a number of potentially confounding variables. We have interpreted the resulting effect estimate (in this case an incidence rate ratio) in the standard manner – it represents the difference in incidence rates between the intervention and comparison groups when all covariables in the model are held constant. That is, it is a measure of the association between the intervention and comparison groups after adjusting for a string of potentially confounding variables</p>
              <p>Comment: As a minor comment, multivariate regression is multiple outcomes. The authors more likely mean multiple regression (or less commonly, multivariable but that tends to only lead to greater confusion). This needs to be changed. </p>
              <p>Response: Thank you. We agree and have changed to the more correct term “multivariable”.</p>
              <p>Comment: While there is now a table 1 included in the manuscript, this is of course just the distribution of observable characteristics, and the potential flaw of any cross-sectional (or observational study in general) is that unobservable characteristics still confound the relationship in your study. </p>
              <p>Response: In any observational study there are a large number of unmeasured characteristics. These characteristics may, or may not, be balanced between groups (of course, without measuring them we cannot know if they are balanced or not). It is important to note that the association between groups and caries remained of the same magnitude after adjusting for potentially confounding variables, and that these variables included demographic characteristics, sugar consumption behavior, and baseline caries experience. Extensive literature reviews inform us that these are the key variables that need to be accounted for when adjusting regression models. Consequently, while it is possible unobserved confounders exist, we believe it is unlikely there are other unmeasured confounders that would significantly alter the magnitude of the associations reported in this manuscript.</p>
              <p>Comment: Table 2 needs to have the 2-year comparison in the title</p>
              <p>Response: Revised - Table 2: Association between group and caries increment at 2-year follow-up: per-protocol analysis.</p>
              <p>Comment: If I understand correctly, at baseline there were differences in teeth with incipient caries between treatment and control groups for permanent dentition and advanced caries for deciduous teeth. The authors then report significant differences at the end of the second follow-up in incipient caries increment of permanent surfaces. It does not seem that they did (or were able) to control for baseline differences. This would mean (again, assuming I read correctly) that the results in Table 2 are invalid. </p>
              <p>Response: It is true that there were significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups for incipient caries in the permanent dentition and advanced caries in the deciduous dentition. As suggested, we have therefore now conducted negative binomial regressions adjusted for ‘baseline caries experience’ for results in table 2 followed by a fully adjusted multivariable analysis in table 3. Also, it is to be noted that advanced caries in the permanent dentition was the only outcome that was significantly associated with the group allocation as can be seen in table 2. Therefore, a fully adjusted multivariable analysis was only conducted for this outcome as can be seen in table 3.</p>
              <p>Lines 144-153, page 7: </p>
              <p>The association between group and caries increment was investigated using negative binomial regression models. In the initial model, group was included as the main effect and baseline caries experience as the covariable. Multivariable analyses with full adjustment for all covariables were conducted for the caries outcomes that demonstrated significant associations with group in the initial model. Covariables included in the adjusted models were age, sex, baseline caries experience, soft drink, lolly, syrup/jam, sugar consumption, salivary mutans streptococci and salivary LB levels. The negative binomial model was chosen due to the overdispersion of the outcome data, and the consequent inappropriateness of a Poisson model for this count data. Effect estimates are presented as Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p>
              <p>Comment: Table 3 is not multivariate, but multiple. </p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for the suggestion. This is corrected as ‘multivariable’. </p>
              <p>Comment: In table 3, is the baseline caries experience predictor the total surfaces with caries? I would not think so, but then I wonder why the baseline caries surfaces from Table 1 (incipient and total) are not included in the model. </p>
              <p>Response: In tables 2 and 3, the variable ‘baseline caries experience’ relates to baseline caries on a specific surface and dentition conforming to the dentition and extent of caries in the outcome. For instance: when the outcome is advanced caries increment in permanent dentition, the variable baseline caries experience would only include number of surfaces with advanced caries in permanent dentition at baseline. </p>
              <p>Comment: Regarding table 3, if the authors are saying 2nd follow-up, then that implies they have baseline, first follow-up, and second follow-up. While I see that they included in their response to reviewer 1 that their resident statistician nixed the mixed model, you can in fact incorporate a GEE analysis for incidence or similar method to use all available data. This reviewer agrees with Reviewer 1, if you have longitudinal data, use it! </p>
              <p>Response: We meant the “2-year follow-up” in table 3. To account for the repeated measures nature of the data we have adjusted all regression models for caries experience at baseline. This has the effect on including both measurements of the outcome under investigation in the same model.</p>
              <p>Comment: In the discussion, I would argue that the design of the study does not allow you to prove anything, only conclude associations. </p>
              <p>Response: We have reworded the Discussion to describe the findings found as associations only.</p>

              <p>Impact of a non-randomised caries preventive trial in remote Indigenous Australian children</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Lalloo,</p>
              <p>Please first accept our apologies for the delay in reaching this decision. After another round of review, all positive, by three experts, I am now issuing a minor revision decision as one remaining concern, brought up during review, was not fully addressed. I expect that this should be revised easily and that acceptance should occur quickly upon resubmission without further complication or need for additional review. </p>
              <p>In particular, please note the concern raised by reviewer #2 in the review below, asking you to revise the language in the first paragraph of the discussion section. Namely, reviewer #2 asks that you do not make a claim of proving a hypothesis, but rather, of having evidence supportive of your hypothesis.</p>
              <p>Relatedly, as reviewer #2 pointed out in an earlier version of this work, "impact" may be interpreted causally, which would not be appropriate given the study design and when reporting an association only. "Impact" also appears in your title and for the same reason can be misleading, as pointed out in this earlier review. I do note that you revised your manuscript to address this earlier comment, but claims of proof and impact remain in this latest version of your manuscript.</p>
              <p>The data presented in PLOS ONE manuscripts must support the conclusions drawn (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-4">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-4</ext-link>). For this reason, please revise the corresponding passages and title to make clear that you are only reporting associations, and that your evidence is supportive of your hypothesis, rather than proof of it. </p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jan 25 2021 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>.

              <p>Effect of a non-randomised caries preventive trial in remote Indigenous Australian children. </p>
              <p>Yann Benetrau, Senior Editor, PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Yann;</p>
              <p>We have edited the manuscript as per the recommendations of yourself and reviewer 2. We have replaced ‘impact’ with effect or effectiveness where appropriate, including in the title.</p>
              <p>We have revised paragraph 1 of the Discussion.</p>
              <p>Editor comments:</p>

"Impact" also appears in your title and for the same reason can be misleading, as pointed out in this earlier review. I do note that you revised your manuscript to address this earlier comment, but claims of proof and impact remain in this latest version of your manuscript.</p>

              <p>Effect of a non-randomised caries preventive trial in remote Indigenous Australian children</p>
              <p>PONE-D-19-20492R3</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Lalloo,</p>
              <p>We’re pleased to inform you that your manuscript has been judged scientifically suitable for publication and will be formally accepted for publication once it meets all outstanding technical requirements. </p>
              <p>Thank you for revising your title and discussion to address the comments previously raised in a review due to the non-randomized study design. Please note that after further consideration, although we are now issuing a provisional acceptance for publication, we are asking that you edit your manuscript as follows before submitting the final version so as to further address the concerns raised during peer-review:</p>
              <p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>in order to avoid a causal interpretation of your findings, we request that you do not refer to "effect" in your title. We suggest instead the following title: "Carious lesions in permanent dentitions are reduced in remote Indigenous Australian children taking part in a non-randomised preventive trial."</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>for the same reasons, we request that you add in the manuscript's Discussion a section discussing the potential impact on the results of the lack of prospective randomized recruitment; this is particularly important since there are pre-existing differences between the two groups (according to Table 1). We did notice that you addressed this limitation in your Results section, but we request that this be further covered in the Discussion as well. </p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
              </p>
              <p>Thank you for addressing the above requests in the final version of your manuscript.</p>
              <p>Within one week, you’ll receive an e-mail detailing the required amendments. When these have been addressed, you’ll receive a formal acceptance letter and your manuscript will be scheduled for publication.</p>
              <p>An invoice for payment will follow shortly after the formal acceptance. To ensure an efficient process, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link>, click the 'Update My Information' link at the top of the page, and double check that your user information is up-to-date. If you have any billing related questions, please contact our Author Billing department directly at <email>authorbilling@plos.org</email>.</p>

If they’ll be preparing press materials, please inform our press team as soon as possible -- no later than 48 hours after receiving the formal acceptance.
