                  <p>Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the development of vaccines based on different platforms is essential, particularly in light of emerging viral variants, the absence of information on vaccine-induced immune durability, and potential paediatric use. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted subunit vaccine for COVID-19 based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation by a novel molecular clamp (spike glycoprotein-clamp [sclamp]).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, block-randomised trial of the sclamp subunit vaccine in a single clinical trial site in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Healthy adults (aged ≥18 to ≤55 years) who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, reported no close contact with anyone with active or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and tested negative for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity were included. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received two doses via intramuscular injection 28 days apart of either placebo, sclamp vaccine at 5 μg, 15 μg, or 45 μg, or one dose of sclamp vaccine at 45 μg followed by placebo. Participants and study personnel, except the dose administration personnel, were masked to treatment. The primary safety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse events in the 7 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 12 months after dosing. Here, data are reported up until day 57. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were antigen-specific IgG ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assays assessed at 28 days after each dose.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between June 23, 2020, and Aug 17, 2020, of 314 healthy volunteers screened, 120 were randomly assigned (n=24 per group), and 114 (95%) completed the study up to day 57 (mean age 32·5 years [SD 10·4], 65 [54%] male, 55 [46%] female). Severe solicited reactions were infrequent and occurred at similar rates in participants receiving placebo (two [8%] of 24) and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose (three [3%] of 96). Both solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events occurred at a similar frequency in participants receiving placebo and the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine. Solicited reactions occurred in 19 (79%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 86 (90%) of 96 receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Unsolicited adverse events occurred in seven (29%) of 24 participants receiving placebo and 35 (36%) of 96 participants receiving the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine at any dose. Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a similar antigen-specific response irrespective of dose: 4 weeks after the initial dose (day 29) with 5 μg dose (geometric mean titre [GMT] 6400, 95% CI 3683–11 122), with 15 μg dose (7492, 4959–11 319), and the two 45 μg dose cohorts (8770, 5526–13 920 in the two-dose 45 μg cohort; 8793, 5570–13 881 in the single-dose 45 μg cohort); 4 weeks after the second dose (day 57) with two 5 μg doses (102 400, 64 857–161 676), with two 15 μg doses (74 725, 51 300–108 847), with two 45 μg doses (79 586, 55 430–114 268), only a single 45 μg dose (4795, 2858–8043). At day 57, 67 (99%) of 68 participants who received two doses of sclamp vaccine at any concentration produced a neutralising immune response, compared with six (25%) of 24 who received a single 45 μg dose and none of 22 who received placebo. Participants receiving two doses of sclamp vaccine elicited similar neutralisation titres, irrespective of dose: two 5 μg doses (GMT 228, 95% CI 146–356), two 15 μg doses (230, 170–312), and two 45 μg doses (239, 187–307).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>This first-in-human trial shows that a subunit vaccine comprising mammalian cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted, molecular clamp-stabilised recombinant spike protein elicits strong immune responses with a promising safety profile. However, the glycoprotein 41 peptide present in the clamp created HIV diagnostic assay interference, a possible barrier to widespread use highlighting the criticality of potential non-spike directed immunogenicity during vaccine development. Studies are ongoing with alternative molecular clamp trimerisation domains to ameliorate this response.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented pressure on patients, communities, health-care systems, and economies worldwide. As a result, accelerated development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has become the focus of globally coordinated research activities. The desired attributes of a successful pandemic vaccine include the ability to confer long-term protection, demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety profile at a maximum of two doses, the ability for rapid and large-scale manufacturing, and widespread distribution using existing cold-chain infrastructure.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The candidate COVID-19 vaccines under development can be broadly categorised into inactivated virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, and viral vectors, each with specific advantages and disadvantages.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para20">The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which mediates cell entry and is the main target of the neutralising antibody response during infection.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The candidate SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-clamp (sclamp) vaccine is an adjuvanted protein subunit vaccine that comprises a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and squalene-oil-in-water adjuvant (MF59).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> A molecular clamp is used to stabilise the spike glycoprotein in the authentic pre-fusion conformation that preserves neutralising epitopes present on the virion surface. Immunisation with the stabilised antigen therefore stimulates neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which mimics the response induced by natural infection and minimises the induction of potentially confounding non-neutralising antibodies.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Similar to other vaccine platforms that stabilise the pre-fusion conformation of spike glycoprotein,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> this approach is anticipated to generate vaccines with enhanced stability, immunogenicity, and safety profiles.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In addition, MF59 is a commercially approved adjuvant with a well established safety record in children, adults, and older people<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and that elicits strong antibody responses, along with a balanced T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell response.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Although Alhydrogel (aluminium adjuvant) is widely available and recognised as safe in humans, it is noted for driving a predominantly Th2 immune response. A strong Th2 response has previously been associated with immunopathology in humans immunised with a candidate respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, and in preclinical animal studies for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Early in the pandemic it was the recommendation of regulators that Alhydrogel be avoided in human trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Due to the limited amount of information available at this early stage in the pandemic and the combination of the preferred immune stimulation, the established safety profile, and availability, the decision was made to focus on MF59 as the adjuvant of choice for this study. Preclinical data have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine elicits a robust neutralising antibody response to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus, including three of the currently dominant strains, and spike glycoprotein-specific T-cell immunity in animals that protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para30">Here, we report the primary findings of our trial of the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine in healthy adults. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 5 μg, 15 μg, and 45 μg doses of vaccine compared with placebo. In addition, humoral and cellular responses to the vaccine are reported as exploratory outcomes.</p>

                  <p id="para60">We searched PubMed on Dec 22, 2020, for clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, using the search terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, and “clinical trial” with no language restrictions. Only peer-reviewed publications were included. Although many vaccines are in development, we found only one published trial of a vaccine based on the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, packaged as a nanoparticle. In preclinical studies, an adjuvanted vaccine based on the recombinant spike protein stabilised in the pre-fusion conformation by a molecular clamp (spike glycoprotein-clamp [sclamp]) elicited strong, neutralising immune responses in mice, and reduced viral load and conferred protection against pulmonary disease in SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">In this phase 1, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine elicited robust, highly correlated humoral and cellular immune responses, with very low rates of systemic reactions. However, sequences of the HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 used in the molecular clamp elicited antibodies that cross-reacted with rapid HIV diagnostic tests that included recombinant glycoprotein 41.</p>

                  <p id="para100">Although this specific vaccine design will not be progressed further because of cross-reactivity with some HIV diagnostics, these first-in-human results validate the molecular clamp technology as a viable platform for vaccine development with potential for large-scale manufacturability and distribution.</p>

The recombinant protein was based on the sequence of the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 strain first detected in Wuhan, China. This protein includes the spike glycoprotein native signal peptide, replacement of the furin cleavage site of spike glycoprotein amino acids 680–690 with a glycine-serine-glycine linker, and truncation at amino acid 1204 to remove the C-terminal domain and replace this with the molecular clamp trimerisation sequence (HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 heptad repeat [HR] elements, HR1 [amino acids 540–576], and HR2 [amino acids 619–656] separated by a glycine<sub>2</sub>-serine-glycine<sub>2</sub> linker).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The SARS-CoV-2 sclamp antigen has been shown to adopt the native pre-fusion conformation and to bind to the human ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The SARS-CoV-2 sclamp and MF59 adjuvant were stored at 2–8°C.</p>

Because physical masking of prepared syringes was not possible, doses were transported in a boxed blinding bag, and unmasked study personnel administered each dose. All doses of vaccine and placebo were administered as a single intramuscular injection into the deltoid region. Within each cohort, immediate post-vaccination (≥24 h after first dose); safety data from the first two participants (so-called sentinels; one vaccine, one placebo) were reviewed by the safety review committee before proceeding with dosing of the remaining participants in the cohort.

The geometric mean antibody response at day 57 was significantly greater for SARS-CoV-2 sclamp than Nipah virus Fclamp for all two-dose groups (p&lt;0·0001 for 5 μg dose, p=0·0063 for 15 μg dose, and p&lt;0·0001 for 45 μg dose; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3E</xref>). For most participants (72 [80%] of 90), the percentage of the geometric mean antibody response that was specific for the clamp trimerisation domain ranged from 10–40% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3E</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para410">The potential for an immune response elicited by the HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 sequences that comprise the clamp to cause HIV screening diagnostic assay interference was assessed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3F</xref>). At day 57, all participants in the two-dose SARS-CoV-2 sclamp groups produced a result that was considered indeterminate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3F</xref>). The amount of reactivity was more variable for the single 45 μg dose, with some samples showing similar cross-reactivity to participants in the two-dose groups. P24 antigen and nucleic acid testing confirmed that all participants were negative for HIV infection (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 16–17</xref>). Cross-reactivity for participant samples at day 57 was also evident in eight of the 12 HIV screening immunoassay diagnostic platforms assessed (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 18</xref>). In summary, samples assessed with diagnostic platforms that used recombinant glycoprotein 41 as a detection reagent were reactive, whereas those using glycoprotein 41 peptides were non-reactive, a finding consistent with the immunodominant sequences used in the peptide-based assays not being present in the molecular clamp.</p>
              <p id="para420">SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited robust SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses including polyfunctional Th1 and Th2 responses. Analysis of interferon γ, tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), and IL-2 production of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after peptide stimulation showed that spike-specific responses were significantly elevated in all four treatment groups at days 15, 36, 43, and 57 compared with placebo and baseline (day 1; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>

Analysis of the polyfunctionality of responding spike-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells showed that the two-dose regimens elicited polyfunctional Th1 and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) responses, although the increase in the IL-4 or IL-13 expressing Th2 cells was subtle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>).

After the first dose, a very modest and non-significant increase in ASCs and activated circulating Tfh1 cells, along with a significant increase in activated inducible co-stimulator (ICOS)<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> Th1 was observed in the 15 μg and 45 μg groups but not the 5 μg group.

Importantly, these antibody responses positively correlated with broad CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation (intracellular flow cytometry assay) in the two-dose groups, although there were fewer correlations in the single 45 μg group, indicating that robust cellular vaccine responses benefit from a two-dose vaccine regimen (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 28–29</xref>). The highest correlations between antibody and cellular responses occurred in the two-dose 15 μg group, with antibodies strongly correlating with activated CD38<sup>+</sup> human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD38<sup>+</sup>ICOS<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells on day 7, followed by additional correlations with other CD4<sup>+</sup> Th and Tfh cell subsets on day 36. Increase of CD38<sup>+</sup>ICOS<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells on day 7 correlated strongly for all groups, except the two-dose 5 μg group, with antibody responses up to day 57 and could be a potential early predictor of both robust humoral and cellular vaccine responses (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 28–29</xref>).

The two groups receiving one or two doses of 45 μg showed good antibody correlation with ASC, Th, and Tfh responses on day 7, but weaker correlation on day 36, even after the second dose.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para450">These phase 1 findings in healthy adults show that two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine were well tolerated with a similar frequency of adverse events to placebo, irrespective of dose concentration. In addition, two doses of SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine, at all dose concentrations studied (5, 15, and 45 μg), induced a robust neutralising immune response and a spike glycoprotein-specific T-cell response presumed to be indicative of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analyses of more than 100 immune features showed strong correlations between antibody responses detected across all antibody assays, with the highest correlations observed with two doses of the 15 μg SARS-CoV-2 sclamp, which was also strongly correlated with activated ASCs, CD4<sup>+</sup> Th, and Tfh cell subsets. These findings are the first to show the viability of the molecular clamp trimerisation motif for human vaccine development.</p>
              <p id="para460">The molecular clamp platform of SARS-CoV-2 sclamp was designed based on the well characterised and highly stable six-helix bundle of HIV-1 glycoprotein 41, which comprises two heptad repeat regions, HR1 (amino acids 540–576) and HR2 (amino acids 619–656).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Inclusion of these sequences enables the manufacture and purification of a highly stable pre-fusion conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Because immunodominant epitopes of glycoprotein 41 are not present in the HR1 and HR2 regions, it was considered possible but unlikely that these regions would cause HIV diagnostic interference.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> All participants who received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 sclamp elicited a humoral response that was detected by several commonly used HIV diagnostic tests. Although the geometric mean for vaccine cross-reactivity was 30 times lower than the geometric mean for samples from a randomly selected set of 50 patients with HIV, it was within the range of nine of these patients with HIV. Therefore, widespread use of this vaccine would have the potential to impact existing HIV screening programmes and processes and could ultimately delay timely diagnosis for a subset of patients with HIV. Additionally, where a climate of vaccine hesitancy exists, the potential negative effects of miscommunication and misunderstanding of this issue, and the potential for societal misconception around the inclusion of HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 regions within a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, could not be ignored and further development of this vaccine is currently paused.</p>
              <p id="para470">The candidate SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine was shown to be safe and well tolerated. Most adverse events were injection-site related, mild, and transient. In contrast to other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> only a single participant had a fever (&gt;38°C) and the frequency of solicited systemic adverse events was low and similar to placebo. These safety findings are notable as a first-in-human test of the molecular clamp platform and highlight the benefits of using a subunit vaccine with a well understood and commercially licensed adjuvant.</p>
              <p id="para480">Studies of several nucleic acid and vectored vaccines in non-human primates have shown that neutralising antibodies against the full-length spike glycoprotein confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In this study, we showed that neutralising antibody titres after the second dose of SARS-CoV-2 sclamp were similar to those of patients with SARS-CoV-2, with 75% of participants having a neutralising response greater than that of convalescent patient serum samples. Importantly, the immunogenicity of the lower doses was similar to that of the highest dose, which is important for antigen sparing and scalability of manufacture. Moreover, the neutralising antibody responses across several spike glycoprotein variants were similar to the responses seen against live SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine is likely to confer protection against divergent strains. This finding is promising given that novel (and potentially more infectious or dangerous) variants will continue to emerge, which might affect the immunogenicity and efficacy of existing and candidate vaccines.</p>
              <p id="para490">Our findings showed that two doses of SARS-CoV-2 sclamp were required to elicit a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response. The response had a predominantly Th1 phenotype that was consistent with the ASC, Tfh1, and neutralising antibody responses<italic>.</italic> Poor CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell and non-cytotoxic T-cell responses were not unexpected as the MF59 adjuvant is well understood to preferentially drive a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell antibody response in humans,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells have not been observed in humans with similar adjuvanted subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para500">Findings from studies in acute and convalescent patients with COVID-19 suggest that ASCs, and particularly activated circulating Tfh1 cells, are important for recovery from COVID-19.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In this study, ASCs and activated Tfh1 cells were significantly elevated after two doses of either 5 μg or 15 μg vaccine. The requirement for two doses is not surprising given that ASCs are predominantly derived from memory B cells,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and circulating Tfh1 cells are known to assist memory B-cells, but not B-cell differentiation into ASCs.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Unexpectedly, the 45 μg dose led to less activation in the cellular compartments analysed here, possibly indicating that the interplay between antibodies and cellular immunity vary with vaccine dose.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> A range of vaccine platforms that are commercially licenced and available for COVID-19 are needed. The SARS-CoV-2 sclamp vaccine was derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells, a mainstay of the biotechnology industry for which there is extensive global manufacturing capacity. The results of this study provide confidence that mammalian cell-derived spike protein-based vaccines have a safety and immunogenicity profile consistent with other vaccine platforms that have shown very promising efficacy data. Furthermore, adjuvanted protein-based vaccines are known to confer a durable immune response, and the combination with MF59 in this study is of particular importance given its extensive safety and large-scale manufacturing track record.</p>
              <p id="para510">In conclusion, this study has shown the safety and potential efficacy that can be achieved in humans with molecular clamp-stabilised vaccines and MF59 adjuvant. Coupled with the high thermostability and manufacturability previously shown,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> these vaccines would make a valuable addition to the global COVID-19 response. Further development is underway to identify an alternate molecular clamp stabilisation domain that does not include HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 sequences.</p>
