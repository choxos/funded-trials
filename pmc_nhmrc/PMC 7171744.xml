                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common type of chronic liver disease in Australia and its recent increase mirrors the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics. Currently, many patients who present to primary care with abnormal liver function tests or steatosis on liver ultrasound are referred for assessment in secondary care. Due to the large number of patients with NAFLD, this results in long waits for clinical and fibrosis assessment, placing unnecessary burden on the public hospital system.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will conduct a 1:1 parallel randomised trial to compare two alternative models of care for NAFLD. Participants will be randomised to usual care or the LOCal Assessment and Triage Evaluation (LOCATE) model of care and followed for 1 year. We will recruit patients from the non-neighbouring Sunshine Coast and Metro South Hospital and Health Services (HHSs) in Queensland, Australia. Our primary outcome of interest is time to diagnosis of high-risk NAFLD, based on the number of participants in each arm of the study who receive a diagnosis of clinically significant fibrosis. Two hundred and 34 participants will give us a 95% power to detect a 50% reduction in the primary outcome of time to diagnosis of high-risk disease. We will also conduct an economic evaluation, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the new model of care. We will also evaluate the implementation of the new model of care.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">It is anticipated that the results of this study will provide valuable new information regarding the management of NAFLD in the Australian setting. A relatively simple change to care could result in earlier identification of patients with significant liver disease and lower overall costs for the health system. Results will be directly disseminated to key staff for further distribution to consumers, policy- and decision-makers in the form of evidence briefs, plain language summaries and policy recommendations.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par23">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common type of chronic liver disease in Australia and its recent increase mirrors the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of disease in Australia is approximately 30% of adults, comparable to other developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, many patients who present to primary care with abnormal liver function tests or steatosis on liver ultrasound are referred for assessment in secondary care. Due to the large number of patients with NAFLD, this results in long waits for clinical and fibrosis assessment, placing unnecessary burden on the public hospital system. Depending on the presence of risk factors such as diabetes, 60 to 90% of patients with NAFLD do not have advanced fibrosis, are not at risk of chronic liver disease complications, and can be safely managed in primary care. At the other end of the risk scale, recent community-based studies have suggested that as many as 12 to 17% of primary care patients with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes may have clinically significant liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The most important predictor of liver-related mortality is the extent of fibrosis – once NAFLD is identified, assessment of risk stratification is crucial to make decisions about management and referral. Due to the lack of risk stratification at primary care level, coupled with poor general practitioner knowledge about NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], many patients with advanced disease may not undergo timely referral into secondary care. This exposes them to the risk of disease progression, decompensation and avoidable hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">The predicted increases in NAFLD in the next decade will create demand on health services and have potentially large economic costs. As the number of NAFLD cases increase, the health system will incur increased costs associated with its diagnosis, management, and disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The estimated annual cost of liver diseases in Australia is $51 billion, of which NAFLD accounts for a considerable share [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], although few studies have reported economic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">NAFLD reduces health-related quality of life, particularly for those with severe disease who have higher complication risks. We propose that a community fibrosis assessment service will provide NAFLD patients with an integrated model of care, providing accurate stratification of disease risk, timely identification of advanced disease, and guidance for general practitioners (GPs) to enable better community management of mild disease. Gathering evidence from a prospective trial will address critical knowledge gaps in the Australian evidence-base and enhance the likelihood that the new findings will be implemented into routine practice.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Hypothesis</title>
                <p id="Par26">The new model of care for NAFLD patients with fibrosis risk stratification of patients in the community will improve patient outcomes and be cost-effective, by more appropriately triaging NAFLD patients, reducing time to appropriate care, and avoiding unnecessary hospital appointments.</p>

                  <title>Parallel randomised trial</title>
                  <p id="Par27">We will conduct a 1:1 parallel randomised trial to compare two alternative models of care for NAFLD. Participants will be randomised to usual care or the LOCal Assessment and Triage Evaluation (LOCATE) model of care and followed for 1 year to monitor their outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Reasoning</title>
                  <p id="Par28">A parallel randomised trial is an excellent study design for estimating the benefits of a new model of care compared with a usual model of care. Randomising groups in parallel means that variables that change over time cannot confound the comparison of interest, because any changes are equally experienced by both groups.</p>

                  <title>Limitations</title>
                  <p id="Par29">Randomised trials sometimes do not reflect real world settings because of their inclusion and exclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We aim to use as similar a patient group in the trial as would be eligible for the service in real life.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par30">We will recruit patients from the Sunshine Coast and Metro South Hospital and Health Services (HHSs). These are non-neighbouring HHSs located in the south-east of Queensland. Combined, these HHSs provide healthcare to approximately 30% of Queensland’s population (1.4 M residents).</p>
                <sec id="Sec9">
                  <title>Potential for risk, burdens and benefits to participants</title>
                  <p id="Par31">There is little risk for participants as the study involves either current usual care or a modification to a model of care that uses an established modality and treatment pathway. The study makes extensive use of routinely collected data, which reduces the burden on participants. Participants in the LOCATE model of care group may benefit from a faster diagnosis, as per our key study hypothesis.</p>

Recruitment reports show the current cumulative sample size and summary statistics on the sample’s baseline characteristics. We will prompt the data monitoring committee for 6-monthly feedback, share a one-page report on our progress against the milestones, and share this protocol with them.</p>

                  <p id="Par117">We have a minimum total sample size of 156 participants for our primary outcome of time to diagnosis, but we will aim for a sample size of 234. Two hundred and 34 participants will give us a 95% power to detect a 50% reduction in the primary outcome of time to diagnosis of high-risk disease. Our lower sample size of 156 gives us an 83% power. We used a two-sided 5% significance level. We assumed an average diagnosis time of 180 days in the usual care group, and a halving of this time in the intervention group. We assumed that 5% of participants would be censored due to death or loss to follow-up. The sample size was estimated by simulating survival data using the “sim.survdata” function from the “coxed” package in <italic>R</italic> using 1000 simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We assumed a log-normal hazard function with a standard deviation of 10 days. The statistical code to run the sample size is available here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/agbarnett/LOCATE">https://github.com/agbarnett/LOCATE</ext-link>. We assume that half of all patients approached will agree to participate, hence, we aim to approach 468 people.</p>

The denominator will be the number of patients not on statins at the time of their referral letter to the hepatology clinic. We will compare the numbers using a 2-by-2 table and Chi-squared test. Deaths and HCC detection will be compared between groups using a 2-by-2 table. As these two outcomes are likely to be rare, we anticipate needing to use Fisher’s exact test to look for statistical differences between the two groups.</p>

A publication plan that details the likely papers and conferences will be established to inform systematic publication of results through the clinical and academic communities. We will adhere to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors requirements for authorship and will report the contributions of each author. We will not use professional writers. The protocol will be publicly available via ANZCTR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/">https://www.anzctr.org.au</ext-link>) – trial number ACTRN12620000158965. This is a nationally important health services research trial that examines a change to the model of care for triaging patients with liver disease. A relatively simple change to care could result in earlier identification of patients with significant liver disease and lower overall costs for the health system. The study uses a strong randomised design and will collect high quality data to provide clear information for decision-makers. The implementation component of the study will provide valuable information for other health services that may want to implement the model of care based on the trial results.</p>
