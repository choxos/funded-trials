                  <p id="Par1">This cluster randomised control trial is designed to evaluate whether the Communities That Care intervention (CTC) is effective in reducing the proportion of secondary school age adolescents who use alcohol before the Australian legal purchasing age of 18 years. Secondary outcomes are other substance use and antisocial behaviours. Long term economic benefits of reduced alcohol use by adolescents for the community will also be assessed.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Fourteen communities and 14 other non-contiguous communities will be matched on socioeconomic status (SES), location, and size.

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">Community-led interventions that systematically and strategically implement evidence-based programs have been shown to be effective in producing population-level behaviour change, including reduced alcohol and drug use. Australian guidelines recommend that adolescents should not consume alcohol before they are 18 years but 44% do, with 34% reporting use in the last 30 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Community interventions such as the “Communities That Care” prevention framework have the potential to reduce these adolescent alcohol consumption (CTC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The CTC framework can be used to mobilise community stakeholders and organise them to work strategically to prevent the development of harmful behaviour patterns. Communities are supported to utilise local data to identify priorities and then to plan the implementation of interventions that have been found to be effective in previous evaluations.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Large community trials in the United States of America (USA) reveal that CTC can increase community implementation of evidence-based prevention interventions and reduce health-risk behaviour patterns among teenagers, resulting in reductions of between 15% - 25% in the prevalence of youth problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Economic evaluations also indicate that CTC is worthwhile investment. Conservative estimates suggest CTC can produce a return on investment of approximately US$10.23 for every dollar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Over ten years, pilot work developing CTC in Australia has facilitated recruitment and training of community coalitions to plan and implement evidence-based programs. This work has demonstrated feasibility of CTC in Australia. Pilot studies have shown the CTC approach has been successfully implemented with fidelity and has been associated with reductions in teenage alcohol and drug use in line with those achieved in the USA (i.e. 15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This study will employ a Type II translational randomised control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of CTC in Australia.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The primary outcome will be the proportion of secondary school age adolescents who use alcohol before the Australian legal purchasing age of 18 years. Based on pilot work done in Australia and CTC trial work done in the USA, we hypothesise that: compared to control communities, participants in intervention communities will maintain at least a 15% lower rate of frequent (last 30 days) youth alcohol use throughout the secondary school age period (primary outcome).</p>
              <p id="Par23">Secondary outcomes are other substance use and antisocial behaviours and the long-term economic benefits of reduced alcohol use by adolescents for the community. Overall, the research objectives for the trial are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par24">To deliver evidence-based alcohol-use prevention interventions in secondary schools as well as evidence-based community interventions targeting parents and teenagers, targeting teenagers aged 12 to 18.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">To evaluate the intervention using a longitudinal cohort survey and an analysis of archival and prospective health, crime and education records (routine service data).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">To conduct a process evaluation to assess intervention implementation and mechanisms of action.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">To estimate the economic benefits of reducing population rates of secondary school age alcohol use.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">To report on the cost-benefit of the intervention from a number of perspectives, using both trial-based and modelled economic methods.</p></list-item></list></p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>The communities that care intervention</title>
                <p id="Par29">There are five phases to the CTC framework; these provide structure and benchmarking intervention implementation, monitoring and evaluation steps and processes (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.communitiesthatcare.org.au/5-phases-ctc">https://www.communitiesthatcare.org.au/5-phases-ctc</ext-link>). In intervention communities, a lead agency (e.g. a Local Council) will be identified and required to lead the community through the phases, receiving a small grant on initiation of each phase. Standardised training sessions for each of the five phases will be delivered and a trained community relations officer appointed in each of the intervention communities.</p>
                <p id="Par30">Three strategies will be employed in intervention communities.</p>
                <p id="Par31">Brief Communication in Schools have been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This strategy targets teenagers and their parents and will be delivered during 3 school classroom lessons, promoting the following three messages:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par32">Based on scientific evidence, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guideline recommends that children should not drink before the age of 18.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">It is protective for teenagers if there is a household rule set by parents that they should not drink alcohol or be provided with alcohol before the age of 18.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">It is illegal for adults to serve alcohol to children that are not their own without written or verbal consent from the child’s parent or guardian.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par35">Between lesson 2 and 3 leaflets highlighting these messages will be sent to parents/guardians and adolescents will be encouraged to discuss the content of these leaflets with adults in their home. The manual for this intervention component can be obtained from the research team.</p>
                <p id="Par36">2. Community-Based Sales Monitoring. Role-play shoppers will be selected by an expert panel to look younger than 18 years old and asked to purchase alcohol from community outlets. Best practice involves asking for age verification for anyone who looks under the age of 25 years. Feedback letters will be sent to outlets in the form of a letter, informing them of practice in their stores. This will clarify that the strategy is not intended to entrap but to monitor practice and encourage best practice and, moreover, that repeated failure to employ best practice will result in referral to licencing authorities. This strategy has been found to reduce alcohol sales to teenagers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The manual for this intervention component can be obtained from the research team.</p>

                <title>Study design and data collection</title>
                <p id="Par38">The study will employ a Type II, translational, longitudinal, randomised control trial to evaluate CTC. Fourteen pairs of communities (clusters) matched on socio-economic status (SES), location, and size from three Australian states (Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) will be recruited and one of each pair will be randomised to the CTC intervention or a no-intervention control. Intervention sites can be obtained from the research team, control sites will be available after the trial is complete.</p>

                <p id="Par39">The primary hypothesis will be tested using a longitudinal school survey. Three waves of data will be collected; pre-intervention (baseline), and two waves post-intervention (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Flow diagram).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart estimating the progress of communities, schools and participants through trial. Trial registration: ACTRN12616001276448. *Wave 1 will be with either year 8 &amp; 10, or Year 9 and 11, depending on speed in which communities work through the CTC phases, and the ease in which ethics is approved in the relevant school jurisdictions, and thus when the subsequent collection of survey data can occur. Final wave will be with year 11 students and 1 year post school. ** Approximate estimate of sample size of longitudinal cohort after 80% retention rate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2018_5452_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par40">Two secondary schools from each of the 28 communities will be invited to participate. Informed consent of school leaders will be required for school participation and if a school declines a nearby school will be approached. The survey will include items that assess alcohol use, and other related-behaviours as well as risk and protective factors (see measures below).</p>
                <p id="Par41">Students in the participating schools will be invited to complete the survey if they satisfy the following inclusion criteria:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par42">Are in the relevant (either Year 8 or 10) secondary school classroom grades (average age Grade 8 = 14 years; Grade 10 = 16 years);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Have signed informed consent from their parents; and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Have provided individual assent.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par45">Previous data indicate the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for alcohol consumption in the last 30 days at community and school levels were .01 and .05, respectively. We calculated the required sample with power 0.8, type I error 0.05 and design effects based on clustering effect (ICC) at community, school and classroom clustering ranging from 0.1 to 0.01. Recent Australian secondary school survey data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] indicate rates of alcohol use in the past month were 22% in grade 8 (average age 14) and 48% in grade 10 (age 16) (combined average 35%). Assuming 65% of parents consent to their child participating, we will request informed consent from 5400 to recruit 3500 students in 2017 (wave 1). These cohorts will be resurveyed at two time points after the intervention is delivered. Assuming an 80% retention rate, the hypothesised 15% reduction can be detected with 2800 participants in the longitudinal analyses. The research team will work with communities and relevant stakeholders to recruit schools for the study. Primary outcome data will be collected in the school setting using the CTC youth survey.</p>

                <p id="Par82">The Trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/">http://www.anzctr.org.au/</ext-link>; ACTRN12616001276448). The trial team started to develop relationships with community stakeholders in January, 2016, in order to build community capacity to implement the CTC framework. As community relationships were initiated, in September, 2016, the trial was retrospectively registered. The first wave of the trial and longitudinal data was collected in February, 2017.</p>
                <p id="Par83">There are no predetermined criteria for discontinuing or modifying the trial. No anticipated adverse consequences are anticipated for trial participants. In the case of any occurrence, details will be forwarded to Deakin University’s Human Research ethics committee, in accordance with the conditions of the ethics approval for the project. The current protocol (version 1) is in keeping with the current ethics approval. Any protocol modification will be, where appropriate, referred to Deakin University’s Human Research Ethics Committee and communicated through the trial registration listed in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.</p>
                <p id="Par84">Data management will be primarily the responsibility of the research team based at the School of Psychology, Deakin University. Management of trial data will be in accordance with a data-management protocol, which has been developed and approved by the Project Advisory Group, and available on request. The study protocol details requirements regarding data entry, data cleaning, data back-up, secure storage and transport, and analysis. The Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (DUHREC) has approved the project with the expectation that data will be securely stored, and accessible only to primary researchers and statisticians through allocation of access rights. Ethics approval number from DUHREC is 2,015,261.</p>
                <p id="Par85">Confidential data on school and community contact details (e.g. phone numbers, email addresses) will be stored in a secure dataset that is not linked to survey response datasets. A trained research manager will be the only person with access to confidential participant data. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is the primary funder of the trial (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/">https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/</ext-link>). The NHMRC will have no role in the implementation or management of the intervention, collection, management, analysis or interpretation or the publication of the trial data.</p>

This trail will test its potential to reduce alcohol use among teenagers in Australia. We expect that the present approach will be associated with significant effects on alcohol use amongst adolescents because interventions adopted within communities will be based on evidence-based practices and target specific problems identified from surveys conducted within each community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The present study ascribes an important role to coalitions in the management and monitoring and sustainability of interventions.</p>
