                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Undernutrition is strongly associated with poverty - levels of undernutrition are higher in poor countries than in better-off countries. Social protection especially cash transfer is increasingly recognized as an important strategy to accelerate progress in improving maternal and child nutrition. A critical method to improve nutrition knowledge and influence feeding practices is through behaviour change communication intervention.

                <title>Poverty and maternal and child nutrition</title>
                <p id="Par8">Undernutrition is strongly associated with poverty - levels of undernutrition are higher in poor countries than in better-off countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Of the world’s 736 million extreme poor (those living on less than US$1.90 a day or A$ 2.60) in 2015, 368 million, or half of the total, lived in India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia. All of these countries also recorded very high levels of undernutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Besides, there is growing evidence that, within countries, the poor suffer from higher rates of undernutrition than the non-poor. In 2017 in Bangladesh, 24% of people lived below the poverty line compared to 49% in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Reflecting this decline in poverty has been a corresponding improvement in child undernutrition. Despite this progress, there remains an estimated 21 million people living in extreme poverty, and child stunting remains high in rural populations (30.8% for under-5 children), and especially amongst the poorest 20% of households (40.2% for under-5 children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More than 20% of newborns in Bangladesh have low birth weight, which is amongst the highest levels worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to increase undernutrition in vulnerable households due to an increase in food insecurity and reduced curative and preventive health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Adequate nutrition during the critical 1000-day window from conception to 2 years of age ensures long-term health and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Stunting of child linear growth is largely irreversible after the age of 2 years and leads to lower cognitive and educational attainment, and lower-income and socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Improving maternal nutrition is critical to reducing low birth weight and improving child undernutrition.</p>

                <title>Cash transfers and maternal and child nutrition</title>
                <p id="Par9">The 2019 Lancet commission report, the 2008 and 2013 Lancet series on maternal and child nutrition, all strongly suggested the use of both nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions to address the underlying determinants of poor nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Social protection especially cash transfer (defined as the provision of assistance in the form of cash) is increasingly recognized as an important strategy to accelerate progress in improving maternal and child nutrition because this addresses structural factors such as poverty and social vulnerability. A growing body of evidence indicates that cash transfer can increase demand for preventive health care, food consumption and dietary diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Cash transfer will be a key tool to mitigate the potential negative effects of COVID-19 on nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par10">Cash transfer can either be conditional, where beneficiaries must comply with a set of conditions, or unconditional, where no conditions are required to receive payments. “Soft conditions” have been used where beneficiaries are not penalised for non-compliance with the conditions but instead are encouraged by community workers to comply. The premise underlying cash transfer programs for maternal and child nutrition is to increase food consumption to improve nutrition. Cash transfer programs have been shown to increase demand for preventive health care, food consumption, dietary diversity, and improve overall health outcomes, including child mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Also, when targeted at women, cash transfer can promote women’s economic empowerment and enhance decision-making ability, with the overarching assumption that control over cash will lead to greater investment in children’s health and education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par11">Currently, many countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia are using cash transfer to reduce stunting, wasting and anaemia. There is some evidence of significant positive impacts on anthropometric measures such as child weight-for-age, height-for-age, and birthweight although it is not consistent across programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A meta-analysis to examine cash transfers on nutrition outcomes found small but non-significant impacts on height-for-age, and that conditional programs had similar results to unconditional cash transfers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As in most cases, the impact pathway is not analysed, so it is unclear why some cash transfer programs impact nutritional outcomes while others do not. There is also little evidence of the impact of cash transfer on important proximate and indirect outcomes such as caregiver feeding behaviours, practices and psychosocial care, the cost-effectiveness of cash transfer, the value of nutritional education, the value chains for nutrition, spill over effects (on women’s empowerment, local markets, food production, local governance, etc.) and sustained intergenerational impact. Compare to conditional cash transfer there has been less research on unconditional cash transfers. The theory underpinning this approach is that the poor are rational actors, and the provision of additional income will encourage uptake of desired behaviours through which they will eventually emerge out of poverty. Another major argument for the absence of conditions in the poor countries is the poorly developed supply side in health, which would not be able to cope with increased demand resulting from a CCT program. In addition, the capacity for implementing conditional transfer is also much weaker in most developing countries.</p>

                <title>Nutrition behaviour change communications</title>
                <p id="Par12">A critical method to improve nutrition knowledge and influence feeding practices is through behaviour change communication (BCC) intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent studies of large-scale BCC interventions have found to improve IYCF practices in several countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In Bangladesh, nutrition counselling is provided face to face by the frontline health workers. However, the coverage and the quality of such counselling remains an issue. In Bangladesh and other developing countries, mobile phones have been successfully used to inform, support and empower community health workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Mobile phones are widely available in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and this channel has the potential to enhance communication about nutrition in large scale programs. There are currently more than ten recognised medical and health applications available in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The Directorate General of Health Services of the government also has a health helpline 16,263 that provides advice as well as ambulance services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In terms of mobile phone use, Bangladesh is the fifth largest market in Asia. Smartphone ownership and app use in Bangladesh is high, with 31% of the population possessing a smartphone, and this rate of use will likely increase to 75% by 2025. Adoption of mobile broadband is also expected to increase to 82% in 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These findings support that the population, including women of reproductive age, are increasingly turning to mobile health platforms to receive health information rather than relying on face-to-face and paper-based delivery methods. This trend towards the use of mobile health opens up an opportunity to reach women who are less likely to engage with health care providers or are yet to do so. Population-based telephone counselling combines ease of access and privacy with the advantages of in-person individual counselling. All of these reduce potential barriers to treatment seeking. Last but not least, mobile counselling may be standardised and cost-effective for the delivery of in-person counselling.</p>

                <title>Aims and hypothesis</title>
                <p id="Par13">The Shonjibon – Cash and Counselling (SCC) study aims to assess the effectiveness of unconditional cash transfers combined with a mobile application on nutrition counselling and direct counselling through mobile phone in reducing the prevalence of stunting (length-for-age &lt; − 2 Z) in children at 18 months. The primary hypothesis is that in a community-based, cluster-randomised controlled trial of women from food insecure populations, mobile phone-based nutrition behaviour change communications (BCC) and unconditional cash transfers will reduce the prevalence of child stunting at 18 months by 6.2% (40.2% control – 34.0% intervention, or 16% relative reduction) compared to usual programs. The secondary hypotheses are that mobile phone nutrition BCC and unconditional cash transfers compared to the usual programs will: a) increase maternal caloric intake and dietary diversity; b) reduce the rate of low birth weight and small for gestational age newborns; c) improve breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices, including dietary diversity, d) improve women empowerment, and e) be cost-effective in reducing child undernutrition.</p>

Children born to participants during the study will be the unit for analysis and clustering within villages will be taken into account. We have designed a mixed-methods process evaluation as part of the study to examine the factors and roles of the different processes that might influence the outcome. The cohort of mother-child dyads will be followed-up over the intervention period of approximately 24 months, starting from recruitment to 18 months of the child’s age (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

It is a part of the Rajshahi Division. The Ullahpara and Kamarkhanda subdistricts have combined populations of 0.68 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. According to the latest census, there are about 155,000 households in our study area; among them, 92% are in rural communities. The average size of a household in Sirajganj district is 4.3 persons. About 47% of households have electricity connection. In rural households, around 43% of households have electricity connection. The median age for the male is 21.9 years and female is 22.0 years. The literacy rate of the population 7 years and above is around 42%. The economy in the Sirajganj district is mostly agrarian and dependent on crop production. About 51% of the population relies on agriculture activities as their primary source of income. However, Sirajganj is also known for its textile industry. A large number of handloom and power loom industries have been established in the district over the last few years. About 40% of the households in the Sirajgonj are poor (i.e. households with total expenditure equal to or less than the amount required to buy food sufficient to provide 2122 Kcal per person per day and minimal non-food items) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The prevalence of stunting in Sirajgonj is also high with &gt; 40% of children 12–24 months stunted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

The participants assigned to the intervention arm, with the help of the study team, will download the app on their mobiles and log in by inserting the registered mobile phone number. We will train the participants in the intervention arm to use the “Soi Barta” app during the enrolment visit. The app users will need to enter details of their last menstrual period or expected due date for the timing of notifications that are appropriate for the stage of their pregnancy. Users will receive two weekly animated/video/audio messages tailored to the stage of their pregnancy or the age of the child.

                    <p id="Par22">We will establish a mobile phone counselling service (Soi Pushti Sheba) to provide nutrition counselling to the women in the intervention arm of the trial and other members of their households. The “Soi Pushti Sheba” team will comprise of experienced nutrition counsellors “Pushti Apa”. All nutrition counsellors managing the “Soi Pushti Sheba” will be trained to follow a contextual counselling and problem-solving process to listen to and understand our participants, and to focus on practical actions to address nutrition needs. The nutrition counsellors will actively listen to the mother’s belief and existing practices including susceptibility, severity, barriers to action and perceived benefit of action. The counsellors will use a nonjudgmental and empathetic disposition on mother’s perceptions. They will try to increase perceived susceptibility to and seriousness of a health condition by sharing information on the consequences of malnutrition on maternal and child health. They will also stimulate positive behaviour change by sharing knowledge on positive practices as a cue to action, highlighting motivational factors (sharing efficacy of positive nutrition practices in improving child growth and development) and enabling decision making through enhanced self-efficacy (empowerment through information sharing). The counsellors from “Soi Pushti Sheba” will use a life-course approach, from pre-conception and throughout the first 2 years of the child’s life. The counsellor will mainly focus on diet and micronutrient during pregnancy, on breastfeeding, and Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices (IYCF). The study will provide thirty-six 20-min fortnightly counselling sessions. The frequency and duration of the counselling sessions have been fixed based on our experience from a previous pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The core content for each counselling session will be synchronised with the “Soi Barta” mobile application to ensure we provide similar messages through both the channels at the same period of the life cycle.</p>

The well-developed food markets in rural Bangladesh will ensure food products are available for households to purchase. We will use a soft conditional approach where we will ask the mothers to listen to the messages and participate in counselling. However, we will make the cash transfers irrespective of the participant’s compliance. Project staff will follow up with mothers who do not participate to explore the reasons and reinforce the importance of the messages and counselling. Cash will be transferred directly to woman’s mobile bank accounts using the bKash mobile banking service.</p>

                <p id="Par38">We require a sample size of 2184 mother-infant pairs (1092 per group) from 104 clusters recruited over 6 months to demonstrate a 6.2% difference in stunting prevalence between treatment groups (40.2% in control to 34.0% in the intervention or 16% relative reduction). The assumed stunting reduction is similar to that observed in a recent study in Bangladesh for face-to-face nutrition BCC plus cash transfers [unpublished data]. Taking account of the potential loses noted below; we would need to recruit 2840 pregnant women to ensure this sample size for the outcome assessment. In this calculation, we used 80% power, a standard two-tailed 5% significance level, a design effect of 1.28 (based on an estimate for stunted children age 12–24 months from the poorest 40% of households in the 2014 BDHS data and an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.0051 assuming a cluster size of 20. This sample size would detect a five-percentage point difference in the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) between treatment groups with 80% power assuming an ICC of 0.01 and prevalence of LBW of 25% in the control group.</p>
                <p id="Par39">To calculate the estimated sample size, we made several assumptions. We expect the prevalence of stunting (length-for-age &lt; − 2 Z) of 40.2% in control clusters according to latest round of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Each cluster will have two villages with an average population of 3000. Considering the crude birth rate of 23/1000 population over 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], we expect that the average number of births will be approximately 34 over 6 months in each cluster. We expect to reach 90% of births though our surveillance system, which means that approximately 31 mother-infant dyads would be available per cluster over 6 months. From our experience in earlier trials, we expect to lose about 10% of pregnancies before birth, 5% of the recruited women will migrate out from the study area and 10% of pregnant women will deliver outside their village. We expect further loses from child deaths in the first 2 years of life.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par52">This study protocol describes a cluster randomised controlled trial of a cash and nutrition education-based intervention, to improve the nutritional status of children less than 2 years of age to reduce stunting. Poor nutritional status of children is a major global public health problem in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] accounting for 35% of under-5 child deaths and 33% of the disease burden in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is a significant problem in Bangladesh, which has &gt; 20% low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the second-highest prevalence of child underweight globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and a very high prevalence of stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite falls in poverty, the levels of extreme poverty, food insecurity and vulnerability remain high with 21 million people living in extreme poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Developing effective combinations of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions will be integral components of efforts to develop sustainable development policies and programs for nutrition and to prevent stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of cash transfer to reduce malnutrition. In a previous study, we found that cash alone is unable to prevent child stunting, and only the combination of cash transfers plus nutrition BCC improved child growth to reduce stunting. However, both cash transfer and face-to-face nutrition counselling are expensive. So, it is of high priority to find a cost-effective delivery platform and to produce strong evidence that the interventions will work best in the Bangladesh country context. Without strong evidence, it would be difficult for policymakers to scale up such an intervention nationwide. The proposed trial will provide high-level evidence of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of mobile phone nutrition behavior change communication, combined with unconditional cash transfers in reducing child undernutrition in rural Bangladesh. This trial of an innovative approach to enhancing the impact of cash transfers on child nutrition will be a leading study to show an efficacious and cost-effective approach to reducing maternal and child undernutrition in a low-income food insecure population.</p>

              <p id="Par54">The Ethical Review Committee (ERC) of the icddr,b, and the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of University of Sydney have granted ethics approval for this study. Any amendment to the protocol will be communicated to both the ERC. We will seek gatekeeper consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] from local governments before we allocate clusters to treatment groups. We will obtain written informed consent from each study participant, which will be in Bangla. We will also obtain informed consent from a parent or guardian for participants under 16 years old. The consent form will provide full disclosure regarding the study, from pregnant women during enrolment into the study. We will inform the women that they can drop out at any time without any penalty or loss of any benefits from the programme. We will strictly maintain the privacy, anonymity and confidentiality of the information provided by respondents. We will store all trial information in an encrypted database with all identifiers removed. Only associated investigators and data management team will have access to collected data. Auditing trial conduct will be done as per icddrb rules. We will publish the trial findings in peer-reviewed journals towards the end of the study. We have registered the trial in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001975280).</p>
