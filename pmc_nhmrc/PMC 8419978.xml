                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Language is a barrier to many patients from refugee backgrounds accessing and receiving quality primary health care. This paper examines the way general practices address these barriers and how this changed following a practice facilitation intervention.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The OPTIMISE study was a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial set within 31 general practices in three urban regions in Australia with high refugee settlement. It involved a practice facilitation intervention addressing interpreter engagement as one of four core intervention areas. This paper analysed quantitative and qualitative data from the practices and 55 general practitioners from these, collected at baseline and after 6 months during which only those assigned to the early group received the intervention.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Many practices (71 %) had at least one GP who spoke a language spoken by recent humanitarian entrants. At baseline, 48 % of practices reported using the government funded Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS). The role of reception staff in assessing and recording the language and interpreter needs of patients was well defined. However, they lacked effective systems to share the information with clinicians. After the intervention, the number of practices using the TIS increased. However, family members and friends continued to be used to interpret with GPs reporting patients preferred this approach. The extra time required to arrange and use interpreting services remained a major barrier.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">In this study a whole of practice facilitation intervention resulted in improvements in procedures for and engagement of interpreters. However, there were barriers such as the extra time required, and family members continued to be used. Based on these findings, further effort is needed to reduce the administrative burden and GP’s opportunity cost needed to engage interpreters, to provide training for all staff on when and how to work with interpreters and discuss and respond to patient concerns about interpreting services.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par10">Between 2014 and 2019, 15,000 to 20,000 refugees have resettled annually in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A refugee is defined by the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the state of Refugees as “someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Many arrive with complex physical and mental health and social issues and face challenges to accessing primary health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Linguistic and cultural differences between patients from refugee backgrounds and health care providers are major challenges to this population receiving effective primary health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Language barriers may reduce access to quality care from general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], manifesting as missed opportunities for proactive and appropriate care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Language barriers may persist even after resettling for some time in their host country among some people from refugee background with continued need for an interpreter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These barriers may also lead to misdiagnoses or misunderstandings with serious consequences, including the death of a patient or accusations of practitioner negligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">There have been concerted efforts to address language barriers to healthcare access in Australia. These include English language programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the provision of credentialled interpreter services. The federal government funded the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS National, hereafter TIS) provides credentialed interpreters via telephone or face-to-face free of charge to medical practices and practitioners for Medicare-funded services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) recommends the use of credentialed interpreters in its practice accreditation standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Yet, the use of TIS was previously reported low at 1 % of Medicare consultations with patients with limited English proficiency in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], where 33 % of its population was born overseas and 21 % speak language other than English at home. 17 % of the latter group reported not being proficient in English [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Instead, family members, friends and relatives or bilingual practice staff continue to be used as interpreters for patients with limited English [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This approach affects the quality of health care, posing risks to patient safety due to inaccuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and raises ethical issues such as confidentiality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Engaging credentialed interpreters has been demonstrated to help improve access and quality of care, uptake of preventive services, compliance to treatment, and satisfaction with care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and trust towards the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

              <p id="Par18">This study is a mixed-method analysis of quantitative and qualitative data collected at particular time points by the OPTIMISE study. In this section, we describe briefly the methodology of the study as its protocol has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                <title>OPTIMISE study</title>
                <p id="Par19">The OPTIMISE study was a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial, set in general practices in three urban regions of high refugee resettlement across two states (Victoria and New South Wales) in Australia, which are culturally diverse and relatively low socio-economic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Refugee population in this study includes newly arrived people as well as those who resettled in the country for any length of time.</p>
                <p id="Par20">The study planned to recruit 12 general practices each from 3 study regions, 36 practices in total. Eligibility criteria included practices that (1) provided comprehensive primary health care, (2) used compatible electronic medical record (eMR) software with the study’s data extraction software (PenCAT4™) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], (3) were in operation at least 12 months, (4) planned to operate at least next 2 years without substantial management changes, and (5) 50 % of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) GPs consented to participate. Recruited practices were then randomly assigned to early and late intervention groups, with stratification by practice size (FTE GPs equal to 5 or below, or above 5) and region.</p>
                <p id="Par21">The OPTIMISE intervention was delivered by outreach facilitators sourced from regional refugee focused health services. As there was a change of staff in one of the study regions, in total 4 facilitators were engaged in the intervention, which included 1 GP and 3 nurses with refugee health experience. Facilitators were asked to make three visits and 3 intervening telephone calls over 3 to 9 months. The intervention used a quality improvement process designed to improve practice conduct of comprehensive health assessments, identification of refugee status, engaging interpreters, and referrals to required health and social welfare services. All practices focused on the same proposed areas by the study. Each facilitator assisted the practice team to follow the quality improvement cycle using action plans as a tool, copies of relevant guidelines and a summary sheet of key resources for refugee health care. In relation to “interpreter engagement”, we prepared a guide on how to record language and interpreter needs in patients’ eMR as commonly used clinical software lacked specific fields to record such information. (See Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for more details of the intervention).</p>
                <p id="Par22">The study collected from practice and clinicians using various survey tools information relevant to the intervention such as practice size, languages spoken by staff, practice procedures, performance, and perceived barriers. Further data were collected from patients’ eMR using the data extraction tool PENCS CAT4™. Data on interpreter engagement in consultations was sought from TIS. Qualitative data were collected as free comments in surveys as well as through interviews of participants. These data were collected over four time points (Refer to Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

                <p id="Par23">This study utilised a subset of both quantitative and qualitative data related to language preference identification and its recording, and interpreter engagement from practices’ and clinicians’ surveys. Quantitative data for this study derive from T0 and T1 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Between these time points, only the early group received the intervention rendering the late group as control. Post intervention qualitative data of both groups (T1 and T2) were used to explore their engagement of interpreters, attitudes, barriers to engaging interpreters, and better understand the reasons for trends in the quantitative data.</p>
                <p id="Par24">In total, this study included quantitative and qualitative data from 31 practices which were randomised into the early and late groups, as well as data of 55 GPs from these practices who responded to clinician surveys at both T0 and T1 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p id="Par26">Descriptive analysis and nonparametric tests of quantitative data were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics (ver.26) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For practice level data, McNemar and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to examine pre-post intervention changes within groups, while difference in differences (DiD) analysis with linear regression was used for examining changes between groups. For practitioner level data, analyses were adjusted for possible clustering effects at the practice level using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). The significance level for the statistical tests was set at 0.05.</p>
                <p id="Par27">Language concordance was assessed by comparing languages spoken by each GP with those of their patients from refugee backgrounds reported in the clinician survey. If the GP spoke any of the prevalent patients’ languages, then it was assessed as either fully or partially language concordant. For example, if a GP spoke Dari and Dari was one of the common languages spoken by their refugee background patients, then this GP was partially language concordant. They would be considered fully language concordant if all their refugee background patients spoke Dari. Language data were self-reported by GPs.</p>
                <p id="Par28">The qualitative data was coded initially using Nvivo (ver.12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] based on theoretical concepts from Stange and Glasgow’s Context Tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and May’s Normalisation Process Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] by qualitative researchers in the study team (KL, SD, SV, SJ). Text coded as relating to language or interpreter engagement were then thematically recoded to identify patterns of use, barriers and enablers by two members of this study team (SS and MH).</p>

These were assigned randomly to the early group (18 practices) or to the late group (17 practices). Four of them withdrew prior to the completion of the study, leaving 31 practices (17 in the early group and 14 in the late group).

                <p id="Par30">Of 31 practices, 25 practices had less than 4 full time equivalent (FTE) GPs and 6 had four or more FTE GPs, with a mean of 2.6 FTE GPs. The mean percentage of patients from refugee backgrounds per practice was 6.2 % (range: 0.04–86.4 %) in the last 5 years with a median of 156 patients per practice. The number of patients from refugee backgrounds who visited the practices in the 12 months period prior to the intervention varied widely ranging from 7 to 1,781 per practice. Most GP participants perceived that a large proportion of their patients from refugee backgrounds were not fluent in English.</p>
                <p id="Par31">All practices had at least one bilingual GP or staff and 22 practices (71 %) had at least one GP who spoke the language spoken by recently arrived people from refugee backgrounds to Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Many of the practice personnel were bilingual or multilingual, GPs being the highest proportion followed by reception staff, allied health practitioners and nurses.

(see Table A-1 in the appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The qualitative data suggested that language preferences and the need for an interpreter were most often sought by reception staff when a patient have difficulties in communicating in English or when completing a new patient registration form. This was also sometimes identified during GP or nurse consultations. The staff also used a variety of methods to establish the need for an interpreter, such as patients’ statement on the patient registration form, being told by family or friends accompanying the patient, referral notes from refugee health or settlement services, patient gesturing to a TIS poster, use of language cards, or when patients struggled to complete the registration form.</p>
                  <p id="Par37">Despite having practices set up to provide TIS and the reception staff or GPs having established the language preference and interpreter needs of patients, few practices had a routine system or procedure to share such information across all staff.</p>

Language concordant GPs tended to use TIS less frequently (9 %) compared to non-language concordant GPs (27 %) (NS).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par95">General practices employed several means to respond to language barriers between refugee background patients and health care providers. We found a high proportion of bilingual GPs and other staff across our study practices and moderate levels of apparent language concordance between GPs and their refugee background patients. This may be the result of patients from refugee backgrounds seeking GPs who speak the same language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the practices responding to such demand by hiring more bilingual GPs and other staff. While the availability of language concordant GPs and staff, who are proficient in the language, is beneficial to patients and practices, this has potential implications for the general practice workforce and regional and rural areas where an increasing proportion of refugees are being resettled in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par96">Self-reported practice data indicated that half of the practices did not use or perceive any need for interpreter services prior to the intervention. An obvious factor influencing this behaviour is the wide availability of bilingual GPs in practices, which is consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Half of practices reported using alternative means of communication such as family members and friends, other bilingual staff, or online translation. This is contrary to RACGP accreditation standards which state that practices should “use an interpreter with patients who do not speak the primary language of our practice team” (C1.4 A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par97">Patient’s preference for having family members to interpret was another factor GPs and practice staff identified as contributing to a low rate of credentialed interpreter engagement. In addition to lack of familiarity with services, for patients from refugee backgrounds, reluctance to engage interpreters may be due to a concern at having someone they do not know or trust in the consultation in the context of a history of political, religious or ethnic persecution in their own country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Mistrust of authority figures due to their experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and/or fear of lack of confidentiality within their community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] may discourage their use of interpreting services. Patients often bring family members with them for interpreting and support. This may lead to a misconception that using family members for interpreting is the patients’ preference and it is their responsibility to bring them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par98">Time pressure and related opportunity costs to GPs and practices is another driver for not using interpreters. Although TIS itself is free of charge, it requires additional waiting and consultation time, in addition to administrative time for booking the service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The difficulties associated with finding an interpreter and poor quality based on perception or past negative experience also discouraged the use of interpreter services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. There is a strong case for this additional time requirement to be recognised in the funding of all consultations through Australia’s Medical Insurance Scheme (Medicare) when interpreting services are engaged.</p>
              <p id="Par99">Engaging a credentialed interpreter is a crucial patient safety issue and affects the quality of care they receive. Although family members may have a role to play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], they are not an acceptable alternative to credentialed interpreters as they are likely to lack understanding of medical conditions, terminology, and medications with potential risk to safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Family members’ presence may interfere with sharing of sensitive information such as sexual health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Bilingual staff may not be proficient in translating medical terminology or they may lack an understanding of the interpreter role in providing accurate and impartial messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Although online translation may play a role as technology advances, its use is not currently recommended due to concern over accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and security in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. At the same time, the professional status and employment conditions of interpreters need to be looked into to ensure the availability of qualified interpreters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par100">It is important that formal procedures are in place to ensure patients from refugee backgrounds are routinely offered free credentialed interpreter services for all consultations, the confidentiality of interpreter services explained, and any other concerns addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. To improve the engagement of credentialed interpreters, a practice-wide system is required to coordinate the different roles of practice staff in relation to providing quality care. The decision-making process to engage an interpreter needs to be clear to avoid relegation to “nobody’s business” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Receptionists are the first point of contact with patients and have a key role in identifying the language and needs of the patient for an interpreter. The patient’s requirement for an interpreter needs to be shared across all staff by, for example, agreeing on a specific and visible place to record such a requirement in the patient’s electronic medical record (eMR). However, the most frequently used eMR in Australian general practice do not provide a specific field for recording interpreter requirements or refugee status. This could be addressed by software manufacturers providing these fields in support of accreditation standards.</p>
              <sec id="Sec21">
                <title>Impact of the OPTIMISE intervention on interpreter engagement and implications</title>
                <p id="Par101">The OPTIMISE intervention encouraged the identification of language and interpreter needs and recording of these data by receptionists. Increased awareness, improved procedures and the reduction of perceived barriers by GPs in the intervention group contributed to this trend. The number of practices self-reporting the engagement of credentialed interpreters improved in the early (intervention) group, although this was not statistically significant because of the small number of practices involved in the study. This suggests the need for larger scale implementation research in general practice if such measures are implemented at scale by primary health care networks and if complementary system level changes are introduced.</p>
                <p id="Par102">The absolute level of the uptake of TIS remained very low as also indicated by other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This suggests the need for an approach which is tailored to the needs of each practice (including the language proficiency of staff). The OPTIMISE intervention provides a starting point for how support can be provided as it engaged a whole of practice approach and built on existing Primary Health Network (Australian primary health care organisations) refugee outreach programs to support practice staff. Based on the observations of facilitators involved in implementing the OPTIMISE intervention and an earlier paper by Phillips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we recommend 10 actions to general practices for building a practice-wide system to promote the interpreter engagement and to be included in refugee practice support programs.</p>

As noted above there also need to be changes to the eMR in use in general practice. Ideally these interventions should be codesigned with interpreters and CALD community organisations, themselves as well as GPs and other general practice staff.</p>

                <title>Limitations of the study</title>
                <p id="Par116">There were limitations to the study. The intervention was carried out and evaluated largely at the level of the practice. This meant that our analyses were underpowered to detect even moderate statistically significant changes.</p>
                <p id="Par117">The data such as confidence, barriers, practice procedures relied on retrospective self-report by GPs and practice staff which may result in reporting bias. Limitations also include our inability to accurately determine language needs of the patients and therefore to determine the concordance of GP languages due to limited recording of data in patient’s eMR and self-reporting nature of the clinicians’ data.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par118">General practices in our study responded to the language barriers between patients from refugee backgrounds and clinicians by hiring bilingual GPs and staff, using TIS as well as bilingual staff, family members and online translation despite these alternatives being against current best practice. Barriers to use of TIS reported by GPs included the perceived poor availability and quality of interpreters as well as patients’ preference and concern about confidentiality. While TIS provides free of charge interpreter service for GPs for Medicare funded consultations in Australia, the opportunity cost for GPs in terms of the available time was identified as a significant barrier and needs to be addressed at a system level.</p>
              <p id="Par119">The practice-wide intervention facilitated practices to improve the identification and recording of language preferences and interpreter needs as well as engagement of interpreting services. Strong engagement of both reception staff and clinicians has the potential to improve this further. Training on how to work with interpreters and how to discuss the engagement of interpreters with patients and their families are also required. However further research at scale is needed, focussing on how the intervention should be tailored to the needs of each practice and the system change that is required to support this.</p>
