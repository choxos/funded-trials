                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The world is undergoing a demographic transition to an older population. Preventive healthcare has reduced the burden of chronic illness at younger ages but there is limited evidence that these advances can improve health at older ages. Statins are one class of drug with the potential to prevent or delay the onset of several causes of incapacity in older age, particularly major cardiovascular disease (CVD). This paper presents the protocol for the STAtins in Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE) trial, a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of statins in community dwelling older people without CVD, diabetes or dementia.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will conduct a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial among people aged 70 years and over, recruited through Australian general practice and with no history of clinical CVD, diabetes or dementia. Participants will be randomly assigned to oral atorvastatin (40 mg daily) or matching placebo (1:1 ratio). The co-primary endpoints are disability-free survival defined as survival-free of dementia and persistent physical disability, and major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke). Secondary endpoints are all-cause death, dementia and other cognitive decline, persistent physical disability, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, fatal and non-fatal cancer, all-cause hospitalisation, need for permanent residential care and quality of life. Comparisons between assigned treatment arms will be on an intention-to-treat basis with each of the co-primary endpoints analysed separately in time-to-first-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The world is experiencing a rapid demographic transition towards an older population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Increasing survival among older age groups is a major contributor to this shift, with almost twice as many older people surviving into their 80s and 90s compared with 50 years ago.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the USA, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over is projected to increase from 40 million in 2009 to 89 million in 2050 with 19 million (20%) in the oldest age group (85+) by 2050.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Similar trends are seen in other high-income countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, Europe and the UK.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, over the same time period healthy life expectancy has not increased to the same extent as life expectancy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> While preventive therapies have reduced the burden of chronic diseases at younger ages, age remains an important determinant of cardiovascular disease (CVD), dementia and frailty.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> The net impact of an ageing population is that more people are living with chronic diseases for longer, and these can lead to disability and loss of independence.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Loss of independence is not only one of the biggest concerns for older people<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but has significant societal and economic impacts.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> Identifying preventive interventions that can extend life free of dementia and disability (disability-free survival) is an important public health goal. One promising but insufficiently tested preventive approach to extending disability-free survival among older people is statin therapy.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>The debate about optimal LDL cholesterol levels, use of statin therapy and clinical outcomes in older people</title>
                <p>While high levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) are known to increase the risk of CVD events and mortality among young and middle-aged populations,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> the relationship between LDL-C and clinical outcomes including all-cause or cause-specific death in older populations is not consistent. Previous observational studies have reported a mix of no association, positive association or U-curve associations between LDL-C levels and all-cause death,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref> cardiovascular events<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> and dementia.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 23</xref> One explanation for the lack of an association or negative association is ‘reverse causality’, whereby unquantified comorbid disease may be causing both lower LDL-C levels and an increased risk of death or dementia.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Given the uncertainty around the relationship of LDL-C levels and clinical outcomes in older people, the decision as to whether lipid-lowering therapy such as statins should be initiated must be guided by randomised controlled trials. Furthermore, absolute CVD risk calculators, whose use is recommended to assist prescribing decisions for primary prevention, are principally driven by age such that universal treatment becomes the default option without certainty of the risks and benefits for older populations.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p>
                <p>Statins have the potential to delay the onset of several causes of incapacity in older people. Their best-recognised pharmacological action is to inhibit the mevalonate pathway and biosynthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids by binding to HMG-CoA reductase. The reduction in circulating lipid levels, especially LDL-C, underpins their ability to reduce the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke (including subclinical CVD) and their potential long-term sequelae (heart failure, cognitive decline).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Statins also exert a number of pleiotropic effects including anti-oxidative, anti-thrombotic and a moderately powerful anti-inflammatory action,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which could also help explain their reported beneficial effects in reducing disability and the risk of dementia.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The pleiotropic effects of statins have been attributed to the inhibition of isoprenoid metabolite formation (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> These metabolites are intermediates in the post-translational formation of several cell-signalling proteins that control multiple cell functions including maintenance of cell shape, motility, factor secretion, differentiation and proliferation thus explaining improvements in endothelial function, vascular inflammation and oxidation and atherosclerotic plaque stability.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Statins also attenuate neuroinflammation, an enduring feature of neurodegenerative diseases through potent suppression of microglia (neuroimmune cells), activation and inhibition of cytokine production, and have been shown to mitigate the aggregation of amyloid β, a key factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref>
</p>
                <p>In people with known CVD, the benefits of statin therapy are clear, with the risks of cardiovascular events reduced across all ages. In people without CVD, the benefits of taking a statin are not as clear at older ages and continue to be debated.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> Most national and international guidelines have not been able to make strong recommendations to guide prescribing for older people, and any recommendations have generally been informed by subgroups within trials that have not studied the range of health outcomes meaningful to older people and that consider both beneficial and adverse effects.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref>
</p>
                <p>A meta-analysis of pooled individual participant data (aged 55+ years) from 28 statin trials that included participants with and without known CVD, reported a 21% reduction in risk of major vascular events per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, attributed to reduced risks of major coronary events, major stroke events and vascular death.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Analyses by age group indicated the greatest risk reductions (25% per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C) among participants aged 55 years or less. This compared with risk reductions of 19% and 13% for older participants aged &gt;70 to ≤75 and &gt;75 years, respectively.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The risk of all-cause death was also reduced, although to a much lesser extent (9% per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C). There was no effect on non-vascular deaths including cancer deaths. Of note, participants were predominantly high risk, middle-aged men with high baseline LDL-C levels (mean weighted LDL-C level 3.7 mmol/L) or known CVD.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In analyses limited to participants with no history of vascular disease, there was a trend toward smaller proportional risk reductions in major vascular events as age increased.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, a post hoc pooling of subgroup data from two trials of rosuvastatin (the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE 3) trial, concluded that the effect on major vascular events in people aged ≥70 years (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91) was similar to those &lt;65 years (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.97).<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Importantly, the effects on dementia and physical disability were not comprehensively investigated by these studies.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
</p>
                <p>Yet statin treatment is not without potential risk of harm.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Observational studies have reported muscle weakness/pain, liver impairment, new-onset diabetes and haemorrhagic stroke<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 40 41</xref> but the incidence of these adverse effects has been much lower in clinical trials.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Importantly, statins may interact with other medications, contributing to adverse drug reactions and avoidable hospitalisations.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Older adults exposed to polypharmacy are more vulnerable to adverse reactions and increased risks of adverse effects. As with efficacy, the burden of statin adverse effects in older people has not been well studied. As a result, it is still not possible to know the balance of risks and benefits in this age group.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the gains made in increasing lifespan may not have been accompanied by similar gains in healthy life, for the additional later years of life lived. A strong potential exists for greater use of statins for primary prevention to extend healthy life and maintain independence among the ageing population however, current evidence for starting statins among older people is insufficient to support this approach. The STAtins in Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE) trial is a large scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) specifically designed to address this need.</p>

                <p>Recruitment is being conducted through general practices across metropolitan and regional/rural Australia with participating general practitioners (GPs) registered as STAREE co-investigators. General practice clinical database reviews create a list of potential participants aged ≥70 years without a history of clinical CVD, diabetes, dementia or other life-limiting conditions. Each GP screens the list for suitability and approves the sending of an invitation letter through the mail. Potential participants call the study centre and undergo an initial phone screening for trial inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who are eligible are invited to take part in two baseline screening visits, either as a face-to-face visit at their usual GP clinic or as a remote phone visit with a trained study team member.</p>
                <p>At the first baseline screening visit informed consent is obtained (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 2a</xref>) and then further eligibility assessments (described below) are completed. Demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, concomitant medications and other physical measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight and waist circumference) are collected. Eligible participants then enter a 4-week run-in period and are asked to take one tablet of run-in medication (matching placebo) each day to ascertain medication compliance. Placebo has been chosen for run-in instead of active drug, so participants are not excluded on the basis of statin intolerance and the results are generalisable to the real-world use of statins. Eligible participants also attend their GP clinic for GP review of the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as any pathology testing.</p>
                <p>At the second baseline screening visit after the run-in period, participants who achieve run-in medication compliance of &gt;85% and have GP approval to participate in the trial, complete a cognitive battery to ascertain baseline cognitive performance (see <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 2a</xref>).</p>

                <p>Ascertainment of primary endpoints will be performed by Endpoint Adjudication Committees of expert clinicians. These Committees will adjudicate events related to possible MI, stroke, dementia, disability, heart failure and trajectory and mode of death.

Two members will conduct adjudications for each event and discordant cases will be resolved via consensus of all committee members.</p>
                <p>Disability-free survival is defined as survival free of dementia or physical disability as derived from the endpoints of all-cause death, dementia and persistent physical disability. It is a composite endpoint that has been used in recent clinical trials and enables an evaluation of the net benefit of statin by capturing both beneficial and adverse effects.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>

                <p>Dementia is defined as a significant impairment in cognitive function (≥2 SD below population norms; <xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 2b</xref>) that interferes with independence in everyday activities<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> or as a clinical diagnosis based on the medical record. Persistent physical disability is defined as a loss in an activity of daily living (ADL)<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>based on the Life Ability questionnaire at two consecutive visits separated by a period of 6 months. A loss of an ADL (mobility, bathing, transferring, toileting, dressing or feeding) will equate to a self-report of ‘a lot of difficulty’, ‘unable to do this activity’ or a requirement for help in performing the activity. If it is not possible to obtain an ADL assessment, notification of assessment for aged care services will initiate collection of relevant clinical records.</p>
                <p>A major cardiovascular event is defined as the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke.

                <p>The recruitment rate in Australia was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, STAREE was originally planned as an international endeavour with proposed funding and recruitment across multiple regions including Australia, however in late 2020 it became evident that the proposed funding for recruitment outside of Australia would not be secured. These developments were considered in July 2021 in finalisation of the trial design, reduction in the sample size from an original target of n=18 000 and corresponding power calculation to allow for feasible completion of the trial in Australia alone.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups will be tabulated and imbalance defined as a 0.25 SD difference in means (quantitative characteristics) or an OR of 1.5 (binary characteristics). Given the large sample size, randomisation is anticipated to adequately balance baseline characteristics of participants in the two treatment groups. Hence unadjusted analyses will be considered primary. All primary comparisons between treatment arms will be on an intention-to-treat basis, that is, according to the group to which participants were randomised and without reference to their actual compliance with assigned treatment. Each of the co-primary endpoints will be analysed separately in time-to-event analyses. Event rates (time to first event within each endpoint definition) will be compared between groups using an HR and 95% CI from a Cox proportional hazards regression model fitted to the endpoint, with censoring for individuals not experiencing an endpoint event at their most recent study visit, and a single covariate being an indicator of the group to which the individual was randomised, statin or placebo. The proportional hazards assumption will be tested for each model. Loss to follow-up will be considered a censoring event. This equates to an assumption that data is missing at random given the participant’s treatment group and the timing of their loss to follow-up. The adequacy of this assumption will be checked in sensitivity analyses that will include both imputation approaches and adjustment for baseline covariates predictive of propensity for dropout.</p>
                <p>A closed testing procedure will be used to allow for the multiple testing arising from two co-primary endpoints. This approach is based on the expectation that cardiovascular benefit will be the main contributor to improved disability-free survival and that a substantial effect of statins on the latter is unlikely in the absence of an effect on the former. First, major cardiovascular events will be tested at alpha=0.05 and, if the major cardiovascular events p value is &lt;0.05 then second, disability-free survival will be tested at alpha=0.05. If the major cardiovascular events p value is not &lt;0.05 than a p value for disability-free survival will not be presented.</p>
                <p>Secondary analyses of the co-primary endpoints will be performed using extended Cox proportional hazards regression models based on time(s) to any event within the endpoint definition (for relevant endpoints that can occur more than once). No statistical adjustment will be made for the multiple secondary endpoints and no p values will be presented for the statin versus placebo comparison for these endpoints. The reporting of all secondary endpoint analyses will make clear whether either of the co-primary endpoints were statistically significant.</p>
                <p>Subgroup analyses will be undertaken by sex (female, male), age (70–74, ≥75 years), systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels (terciles), body mass index (&lt;25, 25–29.9, 30+ kg/m<sup>2</sup>), smoking status (never, past and current), 3MS score (above, below median), eGFR (&lt;60, ≥60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and LDL-C and HDL-C levels (terciles).</p>
                <p>The impacts of COVID-19 will be investigated in sensitivity analyses that include examination of participant event rates by whether their randomisation occurred pre-pandemic, peri-pandemic or post-pandemic, and consider COVID-19 vaccination status (which will be an intercurrent event for those randomised pre-pandemic and a baseline covariate for those randomised post-pandemic), following emerging guidance on analytical approaches and estimand definitions.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>

                <p>Recruitment commenced in November 2015 and was expected to be completed in 2021. However, COVID-19 public health directives and work restrictions resulted in reduced access to general practices across Australia such that recruitment had to be extended for further 18 months.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>There is continuing debate on the utility of statins for primary prevention in older people primarily due to the lack of RCT evidence in this population.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> While no new RCTs of statins have been reported since the conception and commencement of STAREE in 2015 and completion of HOPE 3 in 2016, new analyses of existing RCT data have added to the debate. Age-specific analyses of pooled data from the HOPE 3 and JUPITER RCTs have suggested significant CVD benefits for all age groups above 65 years including a 26% risk reduction in CVD events in individuals aged 70 years and over.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> A meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of individual participant data from 28 RCTs of statin therapy that included participants over 75 years indicated non-significant 16% and 8% reductions in major vascular events per 1.0 mml/L reduction in LDL-C among 70–75 and &gt;75 year age groups, respectively, without known vascular disease.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, no significant effects on vascular death, non-vascular death, cancer death or all-cause death were observed in either of these older age groups. Guidelines for statin prescription reflect this lack of robust trial evidence, with varying recommendations for apparently healthy older adults over 70 or 75 years, which have led to confusion among clinicians and consumers alike. In contrast, specific data exist for the use of aspirin and anti-hypertensive drugs in this population which has informed guideline committees in making recommendations for intervention.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 51 55</xref> STAREE will provide new trial evidence to address this critical gap for statins.</p>
              <p>STAREE is a large primary prevention trial that is assessing whether starting statins in adults 70 years and older will extend independent and healthy lifespan. While STAREE captures the CVD endpoints that are the traditional primary outcomes of statin trials, we consider that a wider range of outcomes beyond major CVD events is important to evaluate the overall benefit of statins in an older population. To this end, our disability-free survival outcome including detailed ascertainment of dementia using well validated measures of cognition, such as those used in the ASPREE trial<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and advocated by others,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> will allow us to determine whether statins reduce major cardiovascular events and prolong survival-free of dementia or physical disability; health outcomes that are highly valued by older people and the general population.</p>
