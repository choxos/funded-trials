                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Target-D, a new person-centred e-health platform matching depression care to symptom severity prognosis (minimal/mild, moderate or severe) has demonstrated greater improvement in depressive symptoms than usual care plus attention control. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Target-D compared to usual care from a health sector and partial societal perspective across 3-month and 12-month follow-up.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside the Target-D randomised controlled trial; which involved 1,868 participants attending 14 general practices in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Data on costs were collected using a resource use questionnaire administered concurrently with all other outcome measures at baseline, 3-month and 12-month follow-up. Intervention costs were assessed using financial records compiled during the trial. All costs were expressed in Australian dollars (A$) for the 2018–19 financial year. QALY outcomes were derived using the Assessment of Quality of Life-8D (AQoL-8D) questionnaire. On a per person basis, the Target-D intervention cost between $14 (minimal/mild prognostic group) and $676 (severe group). Health sector and societal costs were not significantly different between trial arms at both 3 and 12 months. Relative to a A$50,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, the probability of Target-D being cost-effective under a health sector perspective was 81% at 3 months and 96% at 12 months. From a societal perspective, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 30% at 3 months and 80% at 12 months.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Target-D is likely to represent good value for money for health care decision makers. Further evaluation of QALY outcomes should accompany any routine roll-out to assess comparability of results to those observed in the trial. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616000537459).</p>

              <p>Depression is a leading cause of disease burden globally and is associated with widespread economic impacts [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268948.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several effective treatments for depression exist, including psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Stepped care approaches, which start from a low-intensity intervention before transitioning to increasing levels of treatment, are recommended by several depression treatment guidelines as optimal clinical practice [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While evidence exists on the effectiveness/cost-effectiveness of stepped care approaches for anxiety disorders, there is comparatively little evidence for these approaches when treating depression [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Target-D is a new approach comprising a clinical prediction tool (CPT) embedded within a person-centred e-health platform that provides symptom feedback, priority setting and management options matched to the predicted severity of an individual’s depressive symptoms in three months’ time (i.e., minimal/mild, moderate or severe) [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) recently showed that, relative to usual care, Target-D improves depressive symptoms at 3 months (as measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9])–i.e., a standardised mean reduction of -0.16 (95% confidence interval: -0.26 to -0.05) [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study describes the economic evaluation conducted within the Target-D RCT. It aims to determine whether systematically matching depression care to symptom severity prognosis was cost-effective when compared to usual care.</p>

                <title>Intervention trial</title>
                <p>A within-trial economic evaluation was conducted across 14 general practices in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Study participants were aged 18–65 years and self-reported: current depressive symptoms (scoring ≥2 on the PHQ-2); stable antidepressant medication use in the past month; no antipsychotic medication use or regular psychotherapy; internet access; and English proficiency. The trial compared the Target-D intervention (feedback, priority setting and prognosis-matched management options) to usual care plus attention control (a telephone call from the research team). Management options for participants in the intervention arm included: (1) unguided internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) (minimal/mild prognostic group) [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; (2) clinician-guided iCBT (moderate group) [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and (3) nurse-led collaborative care (severe group) [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. S1 Text (see <xref rid="pone.0268948.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>) outlines treatments received in each trial arm. The study protocol and analysis of clinical outcomes are described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268948.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

                <title>Cost analysis</title>
                <p>The economic evaluation primarily adopted an Australian health sector perspective. An additional analysis was also conducted from a partial societal perspective, as recommended by recent economic evaluation guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Health sector costs included the cost of delivering Target-D alongside the cost of other health care services incurred by study participants over the trial period. Societal costs included all health sector costs plus the cost of self-reported productivity losses. S2 Table (see <xref rid="pone.0268948.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>) presents an impact inventory with details of each cost component by study perspective. All costs are presented in Australian dollars (A$) for the 2018–19 financial year. Discounting was not required.</p>
                <p>A micro-costing approach was used to estimate the cost of the Target-D intervention based on trial data (see S3 Table in <xref rid="pone.0268948.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). Intervention costs were divided into: (1) the costs of screening using the Target-D CPT; and (2) the costs of treating participants within each assigned prognostic group. Screening costs were sourced from the study team which comprised the cost of hardware (iPads and Wi-Fi dongles) and the cost of CPT maintenance. Personnel time to approach individuals in the GP waiting room involved one minute per encounter and was costed using the relevant wage rate (plus overheads) for a research assistant. The average cost per screened person was computed and applied to everyone in the intervention arm.</p>
                <p>Intervention costs for participants in the minimal/mild prognostic group comprised the annual registration cost of an Australian unguided iCBT program [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the cost of research assistants providing an initial check-in phone call. The average cost between two Australian clinician-guided iCBT programs was applied to participants in the moderate prognostic group [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268948.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], alongside the cost of research assistants providing periodic check-in phone calls to monitor participant progress. In this instance, the two programs represent a low-to-high range of possible unit cost values for clinician-guided iCBT in Australia. A subsequent sensitivity analysis was done to test the impact of using the highest unit cost, rather than the average. Intervention costs for participants in the severe prognostic group encompassed time/resources incurred by nurses to administer collaborative care (laptops, phones, etc). It is anticipated that all costed activities described above that involve research assistants will likely require similarly qualified staff to facilitate the implementation of the intervention as part of routine practice.</p>
                <p>Participants were asked to complete a resource use questionnaire (RUQ) at baseline, 3-month and 12-month follow-up. The RUQ measured: health care professional visits (GPs, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.); diagnostic tests; medication usage; hospitalisations; emergency department visits; community mental health contacts; and time taken off from paid and unpaid work (see S4 Text in <xref rid="pone.0268948.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>).</p>

                <title>Health outcomes</title>
                <p>The Assessment of Quality of Life-8D (AQoL-8D) was used to measure participants’ health-related quality of life at baseline, 3-month and 12-month follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Australian general population preference weights were applied to calculate utility weights at each time point [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Utility weights were then used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on the area-under-the-curve (AUC) method [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Data management was implemented using Excel 2016 and R version 3.6.0. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 15 (College Station, Texas, USA). Researchers undertaking the cost analysis were not blinded to trial arm allocation. Base case analyses were conducted as intention-to-treat from the health sector and societal perspectives. All enrolled participants who completed a baseline assessment were included. However, 66% participants were missing RUQ data at 3 months (46%) or 12 months (60%); while 68% were missing AQoL-8D data at 3 months (49%) or 12 months (66%). Multiple imputation methods were implemented in Stata to account for missing data that were deemed missing at random following several exploratory analyses presented in S5 Text in <xref rid="pone.0268948.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>. Missing cost and outcomes data were imputed 100 times using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), with predictive mean matching and adjustment for baseline covariates associated with data missingness–i.e., trial arm, clinic, age, gender, highest level of education and having visited a psychologist/counsellor in the past 12 months.</p>
                <p>The difference in mean QALYs between trial arms was estimated using a generalised linear model (GLM) involving the ‘Gaussian’ family and ‘identity’ link. The ratio of mean costs from both health sector and societal perspectives were estimated using GLMs involving the ‘gamma’ family and ‘log’ link. All GLMs were estimated with and without adjustment for several baseline covariates specified in the study protocol ‒ i.e., baseline PHQ-9 score, general practice and prognostic group [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Baseline AQoL-8D utility weights were also included as an additional baseline covariate for GLMs involving QALY outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted across the three prognostic groups.</p>
                <p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the difference in mean costs between the intervention and control arms divided by the difference in mean QALYs. ICERs were calculated by study perspective (health sector and societal), follow-up period (3 and 12 months) and, for the subgroup analysis, by prognostic group (total, minimal/mild, moderate and severe). A resampling method comprising single imputation nested in bootstrapping [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was used to quantify the impact of input parameter uncertainty around the resulting differences in mean costs/QALYs and the mean ICERs. This method works by generating a single call to the MICE procedure to produce a complete dataset with which to analyse GLMs of costs/QALYs within each bootstrap resample. Following the generation of 1,000 bootstrap resamples, the bootstrap percentile method was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) around the differences in mean costs/QALYs and the mean ICERs [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The intervention was considered cost-effective if the resulting ICER was less than the Australian willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000 per QALY [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

                <title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
                <p>Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of including additional baseline covariates associated with non-response at 3 and 12 months that were identified in the primary outcomes analysis (i.e., age, gender, highest level of education, current employment status, health care card status, long term illness, living alone, number of times visited a psychiatrist or counsellor in past 12 months and current use of antidepressants) [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Two additional sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of changes to the intervention costing. The first involved increasing the unit cost for the clinician-guided iCBT program delivered to participants in the moderate prognostic group to the highest unit cost among the two alternative programs (average cost changed from $132 to $222 per person). The second involved incorporating sunk costs around Target-D CPT research and development (average cost of screening changed from $0.96 to $2.30 per person). Additionally, a complete case analysis was conducted for QALYs and costs to examine the impact of no multiple imputation of missing data.</p>

When adopting a health sector perspective, the intervention was found to be dominant across all participants at both 3 and 12 months ‒ i.e., the intervention jointly improved health and achieved net cost savings. Under the societal perspective, the intervention was only found to be dominant across all participants at 12 months. The ICER at 3 months exceeded the Australian willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000 per QALY (<italic toggle="yes">$237</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">128</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">dominant to dominated</italic>).

Confidence intervals were estimated for the mean ICER based on 1,000 bootstrap resamples. The mean difference in QALYs between trial arms was observed to approach zero across all base case and subgroup analyses. This can potentially lead to the lower and upper bounds of a 95% confidence interval, derived using the bootstrap percentile method, encompassing a marginally higher coverage than the target 95% confidence region (e.g., 97% coverage of the mean ICER) [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Even so, any resulting imprecision in the estimation of the 95% confidence bounds will likely be inconsequential to the interpretation of study findings given the wide range of ICER values that were consistently observed between the lower and upper confidence bounds (e.g., confidence bounds ranging between ’dominant’ and ’dominated’). This reflects the high degree of uncertainty observed across mean ICER values for all base case and subgroup analyses; with bootstrap resamples consistently spanning all four quadrants of the cost-effectiveness plane.</p>

The addition of covariates associated with non-response (<xref rid="pone.0268948.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) reduced the 12-month difference in mean QALYs across all participants, which ceased to be significant (<italic toggle="yes">0</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">010</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">-0</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">001 to 0</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">021</italic>).

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>This is the first economic evaluation of an e-health platform designed to personally tailor depression management in primary care. The results suggest that over 12 months, the screening and intervention program is likely to be a more effective and less costly approach than usual GP care. This finding is driven by an observed difference in quality of life between the two trial arms and no significant differences in costs at 12-month follow-up.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Major strengths of this study include the large sample size and the incorporation of economic data collection within the RCT design, thus adding greater certainty to results. The study also used a quality of life instrument that is sensitive to measuring health states among people with mental health problems, thus increasing the likelihood that any quality of life impacts resultant from the intervention would be detected [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268948.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Use of a self-reported measure of health care utilisation may be a limitation due to recall bias; though previous studies have demonstrated the validity of self-reported resource use questionnaires [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While more frequent data collection (e.g., every three months) may minimise recall bias, the additional burden it places on participants and trial staff alike was not considered appropriate for this trial. The resource use questionnaire was thoroughly piloted prior to the commencement of the study and the study authors are confident that all main resource use categories relevant to this population were included. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that QALY gains became non-significant after incorporating covariates for missing data involving the primary outcome (i.e., PHQ-9 scores). This suggests that while significant differences in QALYs were observed at 12 months in the base case analysis, these differences may be considered uncertain; particularly given that differences were not observed for the primary outcome of the main RCT [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The study sample involved an urban population in Melbourne which may limit the generalisability of study findings to other settings (e.g., other countries or rural regions of Australia). Study findings are limited by high levels of missing RUQ and AQoL-8D data, a common issue in trial-based economic evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Finally, the study was powered for the primary outcome only and may be underpowered to detect differences in costs or QALYs [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268948.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>

                <title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
                <p>Interventions that are directly comparable to the Target-D approach have not been evaluated in the literature to date. However, Grochtdreis, Brettschneider [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reviewed several cost-effectiveness studies of collaborative care interventions for depression and which share common features with the Target-D intervention. This review identified ICERs ranging from dominant to US$874,562 per QALY and concluded that future research should incorporate a time horizon of one year or more and QALYs as an outcome measure–both of which were adopted in the current study. Another recent review of the cost-effectiveness of stepped care interventions for depression and anxiety identified one cost-effectiveness study of stepped care targeting visually impaired older people with both depression and anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0268948.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results of this study suggest that stepped care may be dominant when compared to usual care. Additionally, study findings appear to support the existing literature by suggesting that stepped care for depression can deliver improved clinical outcomes without increasing costs.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The Target-D intervention is likely to represent good value for money and provides indicative support for further development of digitally supported mental health care. Refinement and further testing of the approach is warranted to determine whether the size and extent of QALY gains at 12 months can be replicated. It remains to be seen whether results observed under tightly controlled trial conditions will still occur under routine service delivery conditions. In particular, the routine roll-out of the intervention needs to consider how screening will occur (e.g., by staff at general practices or online).</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The paper aims to assess cost-effectiveness of the target-D intervention against usual care. Mental health and primary care are both very important subjects for public health. Evaluation of e-health is also of prime importance. The work is original but more methodological precisions were needed.</p>
              <p>Main concerns:</p>
              <p>1) A micro-costing approach was used to estimate the cost of the target-D intervention except for the clinician-guided iCBT program (moderate prognostic group) (page 5, lines 112-113: “The average cost between two Australia clinician-guides iCBT programs was applied to participants in the moderate prognostic group”). Why?</p>
              <p>2) Some costs appeared to be research-induced (e.g. p5, lines 105-106 “personnel time to approach individuals in the GP waiting room involved one minute per encounter”). Please clarify</p>
              <p>3) The drop-out rate was very important for the RUQ data and the AQoL-8D data. Not enough information is given to the lector on how the missing data were treated. Bootstrapped data need to be stratified by treatment arm. The process of missing data need to be tested, not assumed (page 6, line 140: “assuming data were missing at random”). Tests should be presented and discussed. If data were not MAR, extensive sensitivity analyses (scenarios) on costs and quality-of-life utilities need to be conducted (not only complete case analysis, valid if and only if missing data were MCAR). Please give reference if this issue was treated in a previous paper.</p>
              <p>4) Two GLM had been estimated, one for costs (link=log; family=gamma) and another for utility scores (link=identity; family=Gaussian). In the paper, it is not clear if these models were re-estimated for each bootstrapped sample or only once. If ICER is computed from estimated coefficients, how the ratio was converted into a difference for costs? How potential correlation between errors terms of the QALY equation and the cost equation were taken into account in the analysis?</p>
              <p>5) Concerning the QALY equation, was the value at baseline systematically included among covariates? (not clear page 6, lines 147-149: “All GLM models were estimated with and without adjustment for several baselines specified in the study protocol- i.e. baseline PHQ-9 score (not QALY, as requested in guidelines),general practice and prognostic group”)</p>
              <p>6) It could be interesting to present details on cost provided by microcosting for each level of intervention. Page 8, lines 191-194, be more affirmative “This was likely due to the high-cost nature of collaborative care delivered to participants in the severe group”.</p>
              <p>7) Acceptability curves could be estimated for the 3 prognostic groups.</p>
              <p>8) The conclusion (page 19, line 338-341) was very strong, not really in line with methodological issues mentioned page 18, lines 318-319 and 325-327</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors present an economic evaluation of the Target-D intervention, based on resource utilization information collected during a clinical trial of Target-D versus usual care in Melbourne, Australia. Results are presented both from a health sector perspective and a societal perspective. Authors conclude that Target-D likely has good value for health care decision makers. The manuscript is well written. I only have a few minor recommendations for the authors.</p>
              <p>1. line 43: authors state that health sector and societal costs were "comparable" between trial arms at 3 and 12 months. Authors should replace "comparable" with "not significantly different" since authors did not do a specific test for equality of the costs.</p>
              <p>2. Authors should provide the number of control and intervention participants in each of the prognostic groups (minimal/mild, moderate, severe), rather than relying on readers to go to the published paper on trial results to get this information. This can likely just be put in the text in lines 177-178.</p>
              <p>3. lines 208 (note under Table 1), 217 (note under Table 2), and 235 (note under Table 3): "partcipants" should be "participants"</p>

              <p>Ethics approval for the clinical trial underlying the submitted manuscript was obtained through the University of Melbourne. We have contacted Ms Hilary Young, Secretary for the Medicine and Dentistry Human Ethics Sub-Committee (HESC) at the University of Melbourne, to provide us with guidance on this matter (Phone: +61 3 8344 8595, Email: <email>hilary.young@unimelb.edu.au</email>). We have attached a copy of the resulting correspondence. To summarise, we have been notified that the plain language statement of the original study does not provide a contingency for study participants to provide informed consent for any prospective data sharing, particularly given that collected data is potentially identifying and involves sensitive personal information. As such, we are unable to release the data as part of any minimum dataset. We have amended our Data Availability Statement to read:</p>
              <p>Ethical restrictions prevent the sharing of potentially sensitive data provided by study participants over the course of the Target-D clinical trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12616000537459). No contingency was included in the original plain language statement for study participants to provide informed consent to any prospective sharing of their personal data, whether as part of a minimum dataset or another form. For all enquiries regarding the Target-D clinical trial and the underlying dataset, please contact the chief investigator, Prof Jane Gunn (<email>j.gunn@unimelb.edu.au</email>). For general enquiries regarding the ethics approval of the trial, please contact the Office of Research Ethics and Integrity (OREI) at The University of Melbourne (<email>HumanEthics-Enquiries@unimelb.edu.au</email>).</p>
              <p>As a compromise to our inability to provide a minimum dataset, we have now included an additional supplementary appendix (S2 Appendix) that contains summary metadata on all in-scope data variables, alongside a copy of the Stata do-file. The following sentence has been added to the end of the ‘Statistical analysis’ section of the Methods in lines 175-176:</p>
              <p>A summary list of all variables included in the statistical analysis is provided in S2 Appendix, alongside the Stata do-file used to implement the statistical analysis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
              <p>The paper aims to assess cost-effectiveness of the target-D intervention against usual care. Mental health and primary care are both very important subjects for public health. Evaluation of e-health is also of prime importance. The work is original but more methodological precisions were needed.</p>
              <p>Main concerns:</p>
              <p>R1.1 – 1) A micro-costing approach was used to estimate the cost of the target-D intervention except for the clinician-guided iCBT program (moderate prognostic group) (page 5, lines 112-113: “The average cost between two Australia clinician-guides iCBT programs was applied to participants in the moderate prognostic group”). Why?</p>
              <p>There is no definitive, gold standard unit cost for clinician-guided iCBT in Australia. Instead, we have available two alternative unit costs that provide a low-to-high range of possible values. The point value used in the base case analysis comprised the average of the low and high values. This is the rationale for why we performed a subsequent sensitivity analysis analysing the impact of adopting the highest unit cost ($222 per person). In response to this comment, we have added the following sentence to improve clarity on lines 116-117:</p>
              <p>In this instance, the two programs represent a low-to-high range of possible unit cost values for clinician-guided iCBT in Australia. A subsequent sensitivity analysis was done to test the impact of using the highest unit cost, rather than the average. </p>
              <p>R1.2 – 2) Some costs appeared to be research-induced (e.g. p5, lines 105-106 “personnel time to approach individuals in the GP waiting room involved one minute per encounter”). Please clarify</p>
              <p>We made sure to include costs that would occur in routine practice and to exclude research-related costs. Resource use involving the research assistants (e.g., approaching individuals in the GP waiting room or periodic check-in phone calls) will need to be performed by similarly qualified staff if the intervention were to be implemented as part of routine practice. We have added a sentence to lines 120-122 to clarify this point:</p>
              <p>It is anticipated that all costed activities described above that involve research assistants will likely require similarly qualified staff to facilitate the implementation of the intervention as part of routine practice.</p>
              <p>R1.3 – 3) The drop-out rate was very important for the RUQ data and the AQoL-8D data. Not enough information is given to the lector on how the missing data were treated. Bootstrapped data need to be stratified by treatment arm. The process of missing data need to be tested, not assumed (page 6, line 140: “assuming data were missing at random”). Tests should be presented and discussed. If data were not MAR, extensive sensitivity analyses (scenarios) on costs and quality-of-life utilities need to be conducted (not only complete case analysis, valid if and only if missing data were MCAR). Please give reference if this issue was treated in a previous paper.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to be clear in how we have chosen to address the problem of missing data. In response to this comment, we have now added a new section to the supplementary materials, ‘Supplementary Text S5. Analysis of missing data mechanisms’. In this supplement, we have provided a detailed exploration of missing data patterns and an empirical rationale for why we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to infer that missing utility/cost data can be considered missing at random (as opposed to missing not at random). Based on these analyses, we identified several baseline sociodemographic variables that were associated with the likelihood of missing utility/cost values. We have consequently included these variables as adjustment covariates in the multiple imputation analysis, which was also updated. All results based on these methodological refinements have been amended accordingly.</p>
              <p>We have modified text on lines 144-150 to read:</p>
              <p>Multiple imputation methods were implemented in Stata to account for missing data that were deemed missing at random following several exploratory analyses presented in Supplementary Text 5 in S1 Appendix. Missing cost and outcomes data were imputed 100 times using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), with predictive mean matching and adjustment for baseline covariates associated with data missingness – i.e., trial arm, clinic, age, gender, highest level of education and having visited a psychologist/counsellor in the past 12 months. </p>
              <p>R1.4 – 4) Two GLM had been estimated, one for costs (link=log; family=gamma) and another for utility scores (link=identity; family=Gaussian). In the paper, it is not clear if these models were re-estimated for each bootstrapped sample or only once. If ICER is computed from estimated coefficients, how the ratio was converted into a difference for costs? How potential correlation between errors terms of the QALY equation and the cost equation were taken into account in the analysis?</p>
              <p>The reviewer is justified in their call for further descriptive detail on the methods used to implement bootstrapping. We confirm that the ICER was computed using estimated GLM coefficients of the difference in mean costs and the difference in mean QALYs. In the original analysis, we adopted a resampling method that encompassed, ‘bootstrapping nested in multiple imputation’. Since then, we have encountered recommendations by Brand et al., 2019 (doi: 10.1002/sim.7956) and Prof Andy Briggs who collectively advocate, ‘single imputation nested in bootstrapping’. Based on these recommendations, we have revised our analytic approach and modified our description of the methods/results accordingly.</p>
              <p>The text on lines 161-173 has now been amended to read:</p>
              <p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the difference in mean costs between the intervention and control arms divided by the difference in mean QALYs. ICERs were calculated by study perspective (health sector and societal), follow-up period (3 and 12 months) and, for the subgroup analysis, by prognostic group (total, minimal/mild, moderate and severe). A resampling method comprising single imputation nested in bootstrapping [17] was used to quantify the impact of input parameter uncertainty around the resulting differences in mean costs/QALYs and the mean ICERs. This method works by generating a single call to the MICE procedure to produce a complete dataset with which to analyse GLMs of costs/QALYs within each bootstrap resample. Following the generation of 1,000 bootstrap resamples, the bootstrap percentile method was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) around the differences in mean costs/QALYs and the mean ICERs [18]. The intervention was considered cost-effective if the resulting ICER was less than the Australian willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000 per QALY [19-21].</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we have now included an additional supplementary appendix (S2 Appendix) that contains both the Stata do-file and a summary list of data variables. The following sentence has been added to the end of the ‘Statistical analysis’ section of the Methods in lines 175-176:</p>
              <p>A summary list of all variables included in the statistical analysis is provided in S2 Appendix, alongside the Stata do-file used to implement the statistical analysis.</p>
              <p>R1.5 – 5) Concerning the QALY equation, was the value at baseline systematically included among covariates? (not clear page 6, lines 147-149: “All GLM models were estimated with and without adjustment for several baselines specified in the study protocol- i.e. baseline PHQ-9 score (not QALY, as requested in guidelines),general practice and prognostic group”)</p>
              <p>The reviewer has made an important critique of our methods. Our initial analysis did not adjust for baseline utility scores derived using the AQoL-8D measure as we were narrowly focussed on reproducing the primary outcomes analysis, which made adjustments for the baseline PHQ-9 score. Moreover, we had a priori postulated that baseline PHQ-9 scores would be (in theory) highly correlated to baseline AQoL-8D scores. Following the reviewer’s comment, we have made a decision to re-analyse QALY outcomes after making an additional adjustment for baseline AQoL-8D scores.</p>
              <p>In the methods, we have amended lines 155-159:</p>
              <p>All GLMs were estimated with and without adjustment for several baseline covariates specified in the study protocol ‒ i.e., baseline PHQ-9 score, general practice and prognostic group [7]. Baseline AQoL-8D scores were also included as an additional baseline covariate for GLMs involving QALY outcomes.</p>
              <p>The results that are reported in Table 3 now reflect these changes. Additionally, the first footnote to the results presented in Table 3 on line 253 has also been amended to reflect the addition of the baseline AQoL-8D score as a baseline covariate. </p>
              <p>R1.6 – 6) It could be interesting to present details on cost provided by microcosting for each level of intervention. Page 8, lines 191-194, be more affirmative “This was likely due to the high-cost nature of collaborative care delivered to participants in the severe group”.</p>
              <p>Detailed costs encompassing the microcosting approach are presented for each intervention level in Supplementary Table S3. We have amended to sentence on lines 212-214 to read:</p>
              <p>This was likely due to the high-cost nature of collaborative care delivered to participants in the severe group (see Supplementary Table 3 in S1 Appendix for detailed costs).</p>
              <p>R1.7 – 7) Acceptability curves could be estimated for the 3 prognostic groups.</p>
              <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion here. However, we have opted not to present in-depth results for the three prognostic groups (i.e., cost-effectiveness planes or cost-effectiveness acceptability curves) given that these are subgroup analyses that are underpowered to detect statistically significant differences, particularly when compared to the aggregate findings. We have amended text in lines 162-165 to emphasise the fact that the analysis of prognostic groups encompasses a subgroup analysis:</p>
              <p>ICERs were calculated by study perspective (health sector and societal), follow-up period (3 and 12 months) and, for the subgroup analysis, by prognostic group (total, minimal/mild, moderate and severe).</p>
              <p>R1.8 – 8) The conclusion (page 19, line 338-341) was very strong, not really in line with methodological issues mentioned page 18, lines 318-319 and 325-327</p>
              <p>We have amended the relevant texts on lines 359-362 and lines 365-366 to soften conclusions drawn based on our study findings. These texts now read as follows:</p>
              <p>The results of this study suggest that stepped care may be dominant when compared to usual care. Additionally, study findings appear to support the existing literature by suggesting that stepped care for depression can deliver improved clinical outcomes without increasing costs.</p>
              <p>The Target-D intervention is likely to represent good value for money and provides indicative support for further development of digitally supported mental health care.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
              <p>The authors present an economic evaluation of the Target-D intervention, based on resource utilization information collected during a clinical trial of Target-D versus usual care in Melbourne, Australia. Results are presented both from a health sector perspective and a societal perspective. Authors conclude that Target-D likely has good value for health care decision makers. The manuscript is well written. I only have a few minor recommendations for the authors.</p>
              <p>R2.1 – 1. line 43: authors state that health sector and societal costs were "comparable" between trial arms at 3 and 12 months. Authors should replace "comparable" with "not significantly different" since authors did not do a specific test for equality of the costs.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have amended the Abstract text accordingly (see line 43).</p>
              <p>R2.2 – 2. Authors should provide the number of control and intervention participants in each of the prognostic groups (minimal/mild, moderate, severe), rather than relying on readers to go to the published paper on trial results to get this information. This can likely just be put in the text in lines 177-178.</p>
              <p>We have added this information to lines 194-198 at the beginning of the Results section, as requested by the reviewer.</p>
              <p>R2.3 – 3. lines 208 (note under Table 1), 217 (note under Table 2), and 235 (note under Table 3): "partcipants" should be "participants"</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this mistake. The spelling of this word has now been corrected in all relevant locations.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Lee,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the 2 minor points raised during the review process:<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --></p>
              <p>1) As the effectiveness difference between arms is very small (non significant), I should be preferable to estimate the 95% CI for ICER using the Fieller's method instead of the bootstrap method. The former is less sensitive to misinterpretation of the CI bounds than the latter [see <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.iresp.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Siani-article-3.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.iresp.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Siani-article-3.pdf</ext-link>]<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --> <!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->2) In the QALY equation, the utility score at inclusion should be included as covariate (not baseline AQoL-8D score) [see Willan and Briggs, Statistical analysis of cost-effectiveness data, Statistics in Practice, Wiley, page 24-25]</p>

              </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
              <p>Thank you to the authors for adressing all my comments on the previous version of the paper. I have two (marginal) left comments :</p>
              <p>R1.1 – 1) As the effectiveness difference between arms is very small (non significant), I should be preferable to estimate the 95% CI for ICER using the Fieller's method instead of the bootstrap method. The former is less sensitive to misinterpretation of the CI bounds than the latter [ see <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.iresp.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Siani-article-3.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.iresp.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Siani-article-3.pdf</ext-link> ]</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting Fieller's theorem as a potentially more accurate method by which to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the mean ICER; under the scenario when the expected value of the difference in effectiveness outcomes between trial arms approaches zero (as occurs in our study). We have read through the article by Siani et al. (2003) and note that: (1) Fieller's theorem has the potential to produce more accurate 95% confidence interval bounds with excellent coverage over the 95% confidence region - based largely on simulations analysed in the quoted study; and (2) 95% CIs produced using the non-parametric bootstrap percentile method can potentially lead to confidence bounds with a marginally higher coverage of the target 95% confidence region (i.e., 97% coverage of the mean ICER). We conducted a quick search of the literature and struggled to find studies that have replicated the findings of Siani et al., (2003). This makes it difficult to confirm the veracity of the phenomena identified by Siani et al. (2003). Even so, we concede that the potential for the bias identified by Siani et al. (2003) remains.</p>
              <p>If the aforementioned bias were to transpire, then we contend that such imprecision in the estimation of 95% confidence bounds will not have a material impact on the interpretation of our study findings. This is due largely to the bootstrap resampling results which indicated a high degree of uncertainty around the expected value of mean ICERs estimated across all base case and subgroup analyses (i.e., bootstrap resamples for mean ICERs consistently covered all four quadrants of the cost-effectiveness plane). As such, the 95% confidence bounds produced by the bootstrap percentile method did not approach the nominated WTP threshold of A$50,000 per QALY. This was especially true when the lower and upper 95% confidence bounds spanned the South-East ('dominant') and North-West ('dominated') quadrants of the cost-effectiveness plane. In summary, any (comparatively small) imprecision around the 95% confidence bounds presented in Table 4 is expected to be inconsequential when compared to the extreme range of lower and upper 95% confidence bounds.</p>
              <p>In response to this comment, we have added a note to Table 4 stating that:</p>
              <p>The mean difference in QALYs between trial arms was observed to approach zero across all base case and subgroup analyses. This can potentially lead to the lower and upper bounds of a 95% confidence interval, derived using the bootstrap percentile method, encompassing a marginally higher coverage than the target 95% confidence region (e.g., 97% coverage of the mean ICER) [22]. Even so, any resulting imprecision in the estimation of the 95% confidence bounds will likely be inconsequential to the interpretation of study findings given the wide range of ICER values that were consistently observed between the lower and upper confidence bounds (e.g., confidence bounds ranging between 'dominant' and 'dominated'). This reflects the high degree of uncertainty observed across mean ICER values for all base case and subgroup analyses; with bootstrap resamples consistently spanning all four quadrants of the cost-effectiveness plane.</p>
              <p>R1.2 – 2) In the QALY equation, the utility score at inclusion should be included as covariate (not baseline AQoL-8D score) [see Willan and Briggs, Statistical analysis of cost-effectiveness data, Statistics in Practice, Wiley, page 24-25]</p>
              <p>We apologise to the reviewer for using imprecise terminology that has, in turn, led to this instance of semantic confusion. When we used the term 'baseline AQoL-8D score', our intended meaning was 'baseline AQoL-8D utility weight' – i.e., utility weights estimated based on scoring the AQoL-8D multi-attribute utility instrument. In response to this comment, we have changed all instances of 'AQoL-8D score(s)' to 'AQoL-8D utility weight(s)'.</p>
