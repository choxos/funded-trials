                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants were recruited into a three-arm, parallel group randomised trial and randomly allocated to either: a) real-time video counselling; b) telephone counselling; or c) written materials. At 4-months post-baseline participants completed an online survey that examined self-reported acceptability and helpfulness of the support.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall, 93.5 % of video counselling participants and 96.2 % of telephone counselling participants who received support thought it was acceptable for a smoking cessation advisor to contact them via video software or telephone respectively. There were significant differences between video counselling and telephone counselling groups on three of 10 acceptability or helpfulness measures. Video counselling participants had significantly lower odds of reporting the number of calls were about right (OR 0.50, 95 % CI 0.27−0.93), recommending the support to family and friends (OR 0.18, 95 % CI 0.04−0.85) and reporting the support helped with motivation to try quitting (OR 0.24, 95 % CI 0.07−0.76) compared to telephone counselling participants. Video counselling participants had significantly greater odds than written materials participants of rating the support favourably on all seven acceptability and helpfulness items compared.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Real-time video counselling for smoking cessation is acceptable and well-received by those living in rural and remote locations. Further research is required to enhance the three attributes that were less acceptable for video counselling than telephone counselling.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="par0030">Real-time video communication using the internet and software applications (e.g. Skype) (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Armfield et al., 2012</xref>) can be delivered to people in their home or place of choice to assist them to quit smoking (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). In 2018, there were up to 3.9 billion internet users worldwide (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Statista, 2019</xref>), with users able to download video communication software for free (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2011</xref>). In Australia, 86 % of households have internet access at home, including 88 % of those living in major cities, 82.7 % in inner regional locations, 80.7 % in outer regional locations and 77.1 % in remote areas (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018b</xref>). Benefits of video counselling compared to other behavioural interventions such as telephone counselling and written materials include that video counselling allows counsellors to respond to the client’s verbal and non-verbal cues. The Media Richness theory (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Ishii et al., 2019</xref>) conceptualises that real-time video counselling would rank highly as a rich mode of communication because it provides virtual face-to-face support. The advisors are able to respond to non-verbal cues which may increase therapeutic alliance. Despite these benefits and the growing number of people using the internet and smartphone devices, real-time video counselling for smoking cessation has not been introduced by quitlines as part of routine practice (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Greenhalgh et al., 2020</xref>). The use of video communication technology to provide health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the sustainability of video counselling for smoking cessation. If such support is as acceptable as existing quitline services, then the mode used to deliver smoking cessation support could be based on client preference.</p>
              <p id="par0035">Quitlines provide smoking cessation support including telephone counselling and written materials (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Livingstone‐Banks et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Matkin et al., 2019</xref>). Through quitlines, telephone support and written materials can reach large populations (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>) and particular populations such as young people (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Cummins et al., 2007</xref>) and those living in rural areas (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Sheffer et al., 2012</xref>). In an Australian study, 93.6 % of participants found telephone counselling for smoking cessation to be very acceptable or acceptable and most reported that the advice helped a lot/little with: motivation to quit or stay quit (79.4 %), motivation to try again if slipped (77.1 %), coping with cravings or triggers (64.4 %) and avoiding slips (62.7 %) (<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Tzelepis et al., 2009</xref>). Written materials have also been found to be acceptable in assisting with smoking cessation (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Quit Victoria, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Wakefield and Miller, 1999</xref>). Among those who used written materials from a quitline, most reported that the advice helped a lot/little with motivation to try again if slipped (72.0 %), motivation to quit or stay quit (70.8 %), coping with cravings or triggers (55.4 %) and avoiding slips (54.3 %) (<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Tzelepis et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
              <p id="par0040">Three US studies have compared the acceptability of real-time video counselling to telephone counselling (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2015</xref>) and no studies have compared the acceptability of real-time video counselling to written materials. Two studies measured acceptability using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and found no significant differences between the video counselling and telephone counselling groups on acceptability scores (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These studies targeted particular groups of smokers, specifically women living with HIV (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>) and Korean American women (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The third study with rural residents measured satisfaction with counselling and the overall intervention and found the video counselling arm (97 %) was significantly more likely than the telephone counselling arm (92 %) to recommend the programme to friends/family (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2015</xref>). However, participants in this study attended their physician’s office to use the video-conferencing equipment (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is unknown how acceptable real-time video counselling for smoking cessation delivered directly to smokers’ homes or place of choice is for rural and remote residents compared to telephone counselling or written materials.</p>

This is supported by evidence that about half of smokers make an unplanned, sudden decision to quit (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Larabie, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">West and Sohal, 2006</xref>). A previous trial also found that if a telephone counselling intervention had been restricted to individuals who intended to quit within 30 days, 53.8–65.9 % of intervention participants who achieved prolonged abstinence would have missed out on telephone support (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Tzelepis et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p id="par0060">Participants were recruited via online and traditional approaches (e.g. Facebook, newspaper) (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Byaruhanga et al., 2019</xref>). The Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA+) was used to target recruitment efforts to smokers who live in rural and remote areas. The ARIA + is a geographic accessibility index that reflects the ease or difficulty people face accessing services in non–metropolitan Australia (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018a</xref>). Potential participants were asked to answer a short online screening survey. After completion of the screening survey questions, the computer software determined whether eligibility requirements were met and notified potential participants if they were eligible to participate. Eligible participants’ name, e-mail address and telephone number were used to cross-check they were not already enrolled in the study. Each person was only able to enrol in the study once. Eligible participants were redirected to the online baseline survey and at the end of this survey a random number generator embedded into the computer software randomly allocated participants to either: a) real-time video counselling; b) telephone counselling or c) written materials (control group).</p>
                <p id="par0065">At 4-months post-baseline, the hyperlink to the online follow-up survey was e-mailed to participants which included items about acceptability, helpfulness and satisfaction with the cessation support. A reminder e-mail was sent to non-respondents one week later and after a further week a telephone reminder call was made.</p>

                  <p id="par0070">Participants randomised into the real-time video counselling arm received up to six smoking cessation video sessions conducted by a smoking cessation advisor using the participant’s desired form of video communication. The sessions used cognitive behaviour therapy (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Fairburn, 2015</xref>) and motivational interviewing techniques (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Rollnick, 2012</xref>). The smoking cessation sessions assessed smoking status and smoking history; identified barriers to smoking cessation (e.g. drinking alcohol) and potential solutions, involved discussing effective smoking cessation strategies including both behavioural interventions and pharmacotherapies; and promoting self-efficacy and relapse prevention strategies to quit smoking.</p>
                  <p id="par0075">The initial video session was scheduled within one week of recruitment where possible. During the initial video session participants who indicated they were ready to quit within a month were offered five additional video sessions on the quit date and at 3, 7, 14 and 30 days after the quit date. Those who relapsed and set a new quit date within a month restarted the ready to quit callback schedule, whereas those who did not set a new quit date were offered a call in 2 weeks’ time. Participants who indicated that they were not ready to quit within a month during the initial video session were offered video support sessions at 2, 4 and 6 weeks. If those who were initially not ready to quit indicated during a counselling call they were now ready to quit within a month, they were offered a counselling session on their nominated quit date.</p>

                  <p id="par0085">There were six smoking cessation advisors with university qualifications in psychology, education, social sciences and allied health. Each advisor received an additional one-day face-to-face training session on the study protocol prior to counselling participants. The smoking cessation advisors were also trained on the study background and procedures, adherence to study protocol, the different callback schedules, call content, how to use the video communication equipment and how to record the required information for each video or telephone session. To control for variability between advisors, the smoking advisors counselled participants from both video and telephone groups.</p>

                  <p id="par0090">The researcher monitored adherence to evidence-based approaches via the mandatory information recorded by each advisor for each session. This included information about the evidence-based strategies discussed (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline) and behavioural techniques offered (e.g. goal setting, use of adaptive coping strategies, relaxation, distraction). Video counselling and telephone counselling sessions were offered based on the above-mentioned callback schedules but scheduled based on participant preference. This is the same process used by the NSW Quitline to deliver support in our prior trial (<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Tzelepis et al., 2011</xref>) and ensured responsiveness to participant needs and availability.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="par0195">This is the first study to examine the acceptability of real-time video counselling for smoking cessation delivered to a rural and remote population at home or a place of their choice. On two of five acceptability outcomes, specifically satisfaction with number of calls and recommending support to family/friends, the video counselling group had significantly smaller odds of rating these favourably than the telephone counselling group. There were no between-group differences for the other three items. In contrast, the video counselling group had greater odds of recommending support to family/friends and reporting that the support received was excellent/very good/good than the written materials group. In regards to the five helpfulness outcomes, the video counselling group had significantly smaller odds than the telephone counselling group of indicating the support helped with motivation to try quitting, but there were no between-group differences on the other four helpfulness items. In contrast, the video counselling group had significantly greater odds of reporting the support helped for all five helpfulness items compared to the written materials group.</p>
              <p id="par0200">The majority, 93.5 % indicated that real-time video communication technology was an acceptable mode of delivering smoking cessation support, 88.0 % were satisfied with the spacing of sessions, 90.2 % would recommend such support to friends/family and 92.4 % rated video counselling support as excellent, very good or good. Furthermore, more than 83 % of video counselling participants thought the support they received helped in relation to motivation to try quitting, motivation to stay quit, coping with cravings or situations that make you want to smoke, motivation to try again if slipped up and avoiding slip ups. These findings suggest that video counselling is an acceptable mode for providing smoking cessation support to rural and remote residents. Similarly, studies among women living with HIV (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), Korean American women (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), and rural residents that travelled to a clinic to use the video equipment (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2015</xref>) have reported that video counselling for smoking cessation is acceptable.</p>
              <p id="par0205">The features of acceptability and helpfulness for which video counselling participants rated the support less favourably than telephone counselling participants should be considered. Future research should examine strategies to enhance real-time video counselling in relation to the number of calls received, likelihood of recommending the support to family/friends and motivating participants to try quitting. The current findings are in contrast to a US study conducted with rural residents that found that the likelihood of recommending the support to family and friends was significantly higher in the video counselling group than in telephone counselling participants (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2015</xref>). A possible explanation for the contrasting findings may be attributed to the prior trial integrating the video counselling intervention into physician practices. This allowed participants to interact with staff before and after the video counselling which may have enhanced their experience of the video counselling intervention (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2015</xref>). The current study also found that people with Year 10 or less education were less likely to complete the 4-months survey and be motivated to quit smoking via real-time video counselling compared to those with higher education. Future research should examine the quitting strategies people with Year 10 or less education prefer and tailor smoking cessation interventions accordingly. This may help increase motivation to quit smoking and improve retention among this group.</p>
              <p id="par0210">Compared to the written materials group, video counselling participants had significantly greater odds of reporting the support favourably on all seven acceptability and helpfulness items. This is the first study to compare the acceptability and helpfulness of video counselling to written materials and illustrates that video counselling is perceived more favourably than one form of smoking cessation support offered by quitlines. Given the consistency of the findings regarding the acceptability of video counselling for smoking cessation compared to written materials, quitline providers could consider incorporating real-time video counselling as another form of support.</p>
              <p id="par0215">This study had a number of limitations. Firstly, the acceptability items were in the 4-months post-baseline survey and it is possible the views of non-respondents may differ from respondents. Secondly, the study included only rural and remote areas of New South Wales, which may limit the generalisability of the findings to other populations and settings. Thirdly, examination of potential modifiers of the acceptability and helpfulness outcomes may have been limited by small numbers in the subgroups limiting the power to detect any differences. Fourthly, qualitative work was not undertaken to complement this research and provide a greater understanding about the reasons some features of acceptability and helpfulness differed between groups. Lastly, standards for implementing video-based counselling for smoking cessation may differ across countries, for example in the United States HIPAA standards would need to be met. The standards specific to each country need to be considered.</p>

              <p id="par0220">Overall, the findings suggested that real-time video counselling for smoking cessation is acceptable and well-received by rural and remote residents. However, the video counselling group were less likely than the telephone counselling group to rate the support favourably on three of 10 acceptability or helpfulness items. This suggests that further research is required to enhance these attributes of video counselling for smoking cessation.</p>
