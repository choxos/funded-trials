                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains a major public health problem globally. Long, complex treatment regimens coupled with frequent adverse events have resulted in poor treatment adherence and patient outcomes. Smartphone-based mobile health (mHealth) technologies offer national TB programmes an appealing platform to improve patient care and management; however, clinical trial evidence to support their use is lacking. This trial will test the hypothesis that an mHealth intervention can improve treatment success among patients with MDR-TB and is cost-effective compared with standard practice.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A community-based, open-label, parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be conducted among patients treated for MDR-TB in seven provinces of Vietnam. Patients commencing therapy for microbiologically confirmed rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis within the past 30 days will be recruited to the study. Participants will be individually randomised to an intervention arm, comprising use of an mHealth application for treatment support, or a ‘standard care’ arm. In both arms, patients will be managed by the national TB programme according to current national treatment guidelines. The primary outcome measure of effectiveness will be the proportion of patients with treatment success (defined as treatment completion and/or bacteriological cure) after 24 months. A marginal Poisson regression model estimated via a generalised estimating equation will be used to test the effect of the intervention on treatment success. A prospective microcosting of the intervention and within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will also be undertaken from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness will be presented as an incremental cost per patient successfully treated and an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Tuberculosis (TB) control is an important global public health priority, since TB remains a leading cause of mortality related to an infectious disease and has major adverse economic impacts.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The rise in rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB) threatens recent gains in TB control, owing to its poor treatment outcomes, risk of epidemic spread and cost to TB control programmes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The complex and toxic treatment regimens required to treat RR/MDR-TB result in adverse events (AE) that affect most patients. This poses a major challenge for TB control programmes in resource-limited settings, in which the clinical capacity to manage adverse drug reactions is limited. Drug toxicity frequently undermines treatment adherence leading to partially treated infections which translate into poor long-term outcomes for individual patients and increased risk of community transmission.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Despite a recent shift in WHO guidelines towards recommending better tolerated all oral regimens, serious AEs remain common. New and repurposed drugs used to treat RR/MDR-TB, such as bedaquiline and linezolid, frequently cause bone marrow suppression, peripheral neuropathy and cardiac toxicity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For this reason, the WHO recommends that these new drugs should only be used where adequate oversight of AEs is available.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Even mild AEs can have serious consequences for patients.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Non-life-threatening symptoms such as gastrointestinal discomfort and nausea can often lead to treatment interruption if patients are not adequately counselled and supported. Hence, early identification and management of AEs is a key priority for TB programmes, especially for managing RR/MDR-TB cases.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This is especially challenging in settings with high case loads and limited human resources to counsel and support the patients. In recognition of the need for more active AE surveillance, WHO issued an ‘active TB drug-safety monitoring and management’ (aDSM) framework in 2015,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> comprising (a) active and systematic clinical and laboratory assessment of patients for AEs, (b) timely management of AEs, and (c) standardised data collection and reporting. This policy was developed to strengthen monitoring of patients taking new MDR-TB drugs such as delamanid and bedaquiline, for which limited safety data exist.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, in most settings, including Vietnam, the resources required to scale up aDSM within TB control programmes have been lacking. Barriers to aDSM scale-up in low-income and middle-income countries include a lack of effective processes for AE reporting by patients and TB control programmes, and limited human resource capacity to manage AEs.</p>
              <p>Mobile health (mHealth) is defined as the use of mobile and wireless technologies to improve healthcare.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A growing body of literature has found mHealth technologies to be feasible and acceptable to patients with TB in resource-limited settings.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> WHO recently issued two policies promoting the use of digital technologies to support global TB control,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> and explicitly highlighted the urgent need for research to guide their implementation,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> emphasising that their implementation could reduce inequities but should not become another reason people are left behind.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Randomised trials evaluating the impact of mHealth interventions on clinical outcomes of TB are lacking. Existing support to scale up mHealth interventions has been mixed, in some instances abandoned due to a lack of alignment and coherence with existing programme infrastructure.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Research evaluating both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions to support patients with TB is thus urgently needed to determine its potential impact on patient and programmatic outcomes, and importantly, to optimise TB care delivery. mHealth applications delivered through patients’ smartphones may be able to deliver individualised treatment support at scale, while linking patients with early symptoms of toxicity to healthcare providers. The real-time reporting of toxicity by patients will also foster a patient-centred approach to healthcare delivery, while providing data that will help to strengthen TB treatment programmes.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and affordability of a smartphone-based mHealth AE support intervention, compared with ‘standard care’ (without the mHealth intervention), on treatment success among patients treated for MDR-TB in a programmatic setting.</p>

                <p>Vietnam is among the top 30 high-burden TB and RR/MDR-TB countries in the world, with a recent report estimating an annual incidence rate of 176 per 100 000 population. A diagnosis of RR/MDR-TB is made in 3.6% of all new cases.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, access to mobile technology has expanded rapidly in Vietnam over the past decade. A recent survey showed that 93% of urban dwellers and 89% of rural dwellers own mobile phones—among the highest worldwide.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Smartphone use is increasing rapidly—with 84% of mobile users owning a smartphone<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and 70 % of the population having access to the internet as of 2020.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
                <p>The study will be conducted within government programmatic management of drug-resistant TB (PMDT) clinics in seven provinces of Vietnam. These are located in two cities with the greatest incidence of RR/MDR-TB (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City) and five other provinces (Thanh Hoa, Da Nang, An Giang, Can Tho, Tien Giang). Participating provinces encompass both rural and urban populations from across the country, representative of the population of Vietnam.</p>

The study proposal was reviewed by the Vietnam TB Advisory Committee, a stakeholder group including TB survivors, and App functionalities were refined based on their feedback. In addition, App development incorporated feedback from other stakeholder consultations, including healthcare workers. This participatory ‘ground up’ approach identified important functionalities to improve ‘user friendliness’ and to overcome current inefficiencies in routine patient management, with a specific focus on treatment adherence and AE management. A scientific advisory panel provided input into the development of triaging algorithms and patient educational information to be used within the App; these algorithms incorporated local programmatic guidelines as well as international guidelines.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>

                <p>Once a beta version of the App had been developed, it was piloted among patients with MDR-TB and healthcare workers in one urban province and one rural province to test its usability and refine the existing design for ‘every day’ use. In-depth interviews were conducted with patients with RR/MDR-TB and healthcare workers 2 weeks after enrolment into the pilot; these interviews were used to understand how end users felt about the App functions and ease of use, and also to identify barriers to study implementation from a patient and provider perspective. After incorporating feedback from end users, the App was finalised for both Android (using Java) and iOS operating systems and uploaded to their respective stores for use in English and Vietnamese. The App incorporated end-to-end encryption and password protection to ensure participant data security.

                <title>Description of the intervention</title>
                <p>The intervention comprises an mHealth application which will be installed on patient and healthcare worker smartphones to allow bidirectional communication and support of AE management during the RR/MDR-TB treatment period. Healthcare workers at participating sites will be trained to use the mHealth application. All facilities will have the opportunity to provide patients with either ‘standard care’ or the intervention, as randomisation will be at the individual level. The perceived risk of ‘contamination’ through randomisation at the individual level is minimal given the personal nature of the intervention. In addition, initial stakeholder feedback suggested that staff would not be sensitised to side effect monitoring, which would mitigate against contamination.</p>
                <p>The functions of the mHealth application are summarised in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>. The App will allow patients to report changes in their health status to healthcare workers. Patients will be prompted to enter their health status at a fixed time each day (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Depending on the responses provided by the patients, healthcare workers will be prompted regarding potential AEs that may require investigation and management. Healthcare workers will be reminded through the application to follow-up each step in the cascade of care from notification to resolution of each AE. Healthcare workers will also be reminded to submit a formal notification of all grade 3 and 4 AEs, defined according to the Vietnam National TB Program guidelines (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental eMethod 2</xref>), to the National Drug Information and Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Centre. Patients will be reminded at a patient-nominated time each day to take their medications. Healthcare workers will also be able to use a computer interface to see in real time which patients have not reported their daily medication intake.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of participants with treatment success after 24 months. This period allows for treatment to be extended for an additional 4 months beyond the 20 months of WHO-recommended long-course treatment, if required. ‘Treatment success’ is a standard WHO programmatic indicator of treatment outcome, obtained from routine PMDT registries,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> comprising the sum of treatment completion and bacteriological cure. Treatment completion is defined as treatment completed without evidence of failure. Bacteriological cure is defined as treatment completed without evidence of failure <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> three or more consecutive cultures taken at least 30 days apart that are negative after the intensive phase.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Treatment outcomes will be based on programme records that include registration books and patient medical records extracted at defined time points.</p>

                  <p>We assume that less than 10% of patients will die during the course of their treatment.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Vietnam has made a significant progress in recent years in controlling TB; however, high and rising rates of RR/MDR-TB among new and previously treated patients<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> indicate that new approaches to ensuring successful treatment outcomes are urgently required. Patients with MDR-TB often experience significantly more AEs from longer more toxic treatment regimens compared with patients with drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB). Unmanaged AEs often result in treatment interruption or discontinuation, with adverse outcomes for the patient and the community. A recent retrospective cohort study in Ho Chi Minh City confirmed international experience, with at least 50% of patients with RR/MDR-TB reporting treatment-related AEs.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p>
              <p>Timely AE reporting is a high priority among all patients treated for MDR-TB<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>; however, inadequate systems and human resource limitations remain a major barrier to timely reporting. In addition, the lack of feedback to clinicians by health authorities serves as a disincentive to submit reports, at the expense of good surveillance data and improved patient care. As a rapid adopter of modern digital technologies, Vietnam is well positioned to lead the way in identifying pragmatic mHealth interventions that may improve TB patient care. The use of an mHealth application can play various roles within the End TB Strategy<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and can support patients with RR/MDR-TB with AEs, while also providing strong synergies with other TB control components. This would ultimately enable better use of programmatic data and foster a more patient-centred approach to TB care.</p>
              <p>The V-SMART trial will evaluate the effect of an mHealth intervention on RR/MDR-TB treatment outcomes and patient experience. The evidence generated by this trial will provide immediate impact to the Vietnam National TB Program and other settings where patients with RR/MDR-TB are managed.</p>
