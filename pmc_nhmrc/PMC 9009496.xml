                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and occurs at disproportionately higher rates among Indigenous children. Left untreated, OME can negatively affect language, development, learning, and health and wellbeing throughout the life-course. Currently, OME care includes observation for 3 months followed by consideration of surgical ventilation tube insertion. The use of a non-invasive, low-cost nasal balloon autoinflation device has been found beneficial in other populations but has not been investigated among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial will determine the effectiveness of nasal balloon autoinflation compared to no nasal balloon autoinflation, for the treatment of OME among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia. Children aged 3–16 years with unilateral or bilateral OME are being recruited from Aboriginal Health Services and the community. The primary outcome is the proportion of children showing tympanometric improvement of OME at 1 month. Improvement is defined as a change from bilateral type B tympanograms to at least one type A or C1 tympanogram, or from unilateral type B tympanogram to type A or C1 tympanogram in the index ear, without deterioration (type A or C1 to type C2, C3, or B tympanogram) in the contralateral ear. A sample size of 340 children (170 in each group) at 1 month will detect an absolute difference of 15% between groups with 80% power at 5% significance. Anticipating a 15% loss to follow-up, 400 children will be randomised. The primary analysis will be by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes include tympanometric changes at 3 and 6 months, hearing at 3 months, ear health-related quality of life (OMQ-14), and cost-effectiveness. A process evaluation including perspectives of parents or carers, health care providers, and researchers on trial implementation will also be undertaken.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p id="Par17">Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a common health condition among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia with limited treatment options. This clinical trial investigates the effectiveness of nasal balloon autoinflation, a relatively inexpensive and readily available treatment for OME.</p>

                  <title>Diagnosis and incidence of otitis media with effusion</title>
                  <p id="Par18">Otitis media with effusion, one of several inflammatory middle ear diseases collectively known as otitis media (OM), is characterised by accumulated fluid (effusion) and reduced air pressure in the middle ear space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is diagnosed by otoscopy and tympanometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].
<table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><bold>Tympanometry:</bold> Best practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] recommend pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry for the diagnosis of OME. Tympanometry is a non-invasive test measuring tympanic membrane movement and middle ear air pressure — a proxy for determining the presence of middle ear effusion — and is depicted in graphical form (tympanogram). Tympanograms are classified as type A, B, C1, C2, or C3. Peaked type A and C1 tympanograms indicate the absence of effusion consistent with normal middle ears. A flat type B trace is diagnostic of middle ear effusion in the absence of pain and/or a bulging or perforated tympanic membrane. Type C2 and C3 peaked traces are characterised by significant negative middle ear pressure and are considered equivocal and cannot be used to either diagnose or exclude OME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                  <p id="Par19">Acute otitis media (AOM) is a frequent reason for children to attend general practice and often results in the prescription of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Resolution of AOM is often followed by a period of residual middle ear fluid, or OME. The prevalence of OME in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is disproportionately high, ranging from 10 to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The risk factors are multifactorial including household crowding and poor functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], exposure to tobacco smoke, food insecurity, child care attendance, older siblings, upper respiratory tract infection, family history, lack of breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and socioeconomic disadvantage and other adverse social determinants of health arising as a consequence of ongoing colonisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The duration and severity of disease, and the incidence of complications, are also higher among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly in remote and rural regions of Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Prognosis and treatment of otitis media with effusion</title>
                  <p id="Par20">In the absence of medical intervention, 30% of OME cases in children resolve within the first month of diagnosis, and 90% within 3 months of diagnosis, as determined by international longitudinal research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although most cases resolve spontaneously by 3 months, recurrent episodes and persistent OME can result in impaired hearing and delay in language development with a negative impact on education and wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All forms of OM, including OME, are associated with hearing loss, increasing in severity with more severe forms of OM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par21">Treatment options for episodic, unilateral, or persistent OME are limited. Treatment with antibiotics is of minimal benefit, and not without risk, for improving resolution of OME, hearing, or reducing tympanostomy tube insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], while nasal decongestants and steroids are of no benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Guidelines for OM in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children recommend that children with persistent bilateral OME for 3 months are referred to an audiologist for a diagnostic hearing assessment and to an Ear Nose and Throat surgeon (ENT) to consider insertion of tympanostomy tube(s) to re-establish normal middle ear pressure. This enables clearing of the middle ear effusion and aeration of the middle ear space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], thereby reducing the risk of longer term hearing loss and other complications. However, there are temporal and financial costs and health risks associated with this approach. The deferral of surgical tympanostomy tube insertion to at least 3 months after initial diagnosis means no active treatment and a potential decline in hearing in children with persistent OME, during this period. Additionally, access to surgery is extremely limited for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with OM living in rural and remote areas where surgical wait lists can be years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, although unilateral OME is increasingly being recognised as contributing to adverse outcomes including spacial processing disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], guideline-recommended treatment approaches for unilateral disease based on high-quality intervention studies are lacking.</p>
                  <p id="Par22">Surgical tympanostomy tube insertion (with or without adenoidectomy) is costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Surgical intervention is also limited in its long-term effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and has been shown to result in a 26–37% incidence of post-tympanostomy infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There is a need for an immediate, low-risk, cost-effective, and easy-to-use alternative treatment for both bilateral and unilateral OM. Nasal balloon autoinflation may be useful immediately upon diagnosis of bilateral or unilateral OME.</p>

                  <title>Nasal balloon autoinflation</title>
                  <p id="Par23">Nasal balloon autoinflation is designed to introduce air into the middle ear and facilitate fluid drainage. It can be performed by a person with OME, in any location, potentially offering a possible low-cost, low-risk, readily accessible, and easy-to-use alternative to ventilation tube surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par24">The effects of nasal balloon autoinflation on OME, measured using tympanometry and audiometry, were examined in a 2013 Cochrane review consisting of a pooled analysis of 8 small trials (7/8 studies with ≤100 participants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. No statistically significant difference was shown for tympanometry changes; however, a composite measure of tympanometric or audiometric improvement showed nasal balloon autoinflation for OME was effective at more than 1 month, compared to no nasal balloon autoinflation (relative risk increase = 1.74; 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 2.50). Treatment adherence varied from 43 to 98%. There was no significant difference in adverse events between nasal balloon autoinflation and no nasal balloon autoinflation, with one study documenting ear pain with balloon autoinflation. The authors interpreted the findings as ‘favourable’ but noted that the included studies were small, and recommended further research in primary care. A subsequent study published in 2015 of 320 children (4–11 years) with unilateral and bilateral OME showed tympanometric resolution at 3 months (adjusted relative risk = 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.83) in a nasal balloon autoinflation group versus no nasal balloon autoinflation group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The study also reported improved ear health-related quality of life and good adherence to treatment (80% at 3 months). Another study of 45 children demonstrated improvement in hearing thresholds after 1 month (difference = dB. 95% CI) and concluded the device could be useful while children were on waiting lists for surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Although Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are at increased risk of OM complications, no studies of nasal balloon autoinflation have been undertaken in this population.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p id="Par40">The trial is being conducted in urban and regional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care services across Australia (New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria). The services include Aboriginal community-controlled health services governed by local Aboriginal communities and one state government-run Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care facility. The Aboriginal Health Service staff are multidisciplinary, including dedicated Aboriginal Health Workers and often contracted services providing ear and hearing health care. At the time of initiation of INFLATE, some services were already participating in the WATCH trial, a clinical trial of the management of acute otitis media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The two trials have shared governance, implementation of recruitment, and staff.</p>

              <sec id="Sec11">
                <title>Governance, mentorship, and training</title>
                <p id="Par41">A Steering Committee, Operational Management Group, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and other working groups consisting of chief investigators (CIs), associate investigators (AIs), and Aboriginal Health Service research staff meet regularly to ensure the protocol is implemented correctly, recruitment is monitored, issues are addressed as they arise, and to develop, refine, implement, and document trial materials and processes. All Aboriginal Health Services are encouraged to establish Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community reference groups or equivalent structures. Consultation and communication with and between each service and their community are conducted regularly to review local implementation of the trial, maintain community engagement, and regularly disseminate trial findings to the community. Management of the trial between investigators and Aboriginal Health Services is a non-hierarchical partnership, recognising the different expertise, experiences, and knowledge necessary to successfully conduct research in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care and facilitate knowledge transfer.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander researchers and local community reference groups provide input into and feedback from trial implementation in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care setting and assist other team members to ensure all stakeholders remain respectful towards and learn from participating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Community reference group members are remunerated for their time during 6–12 monthly community reference group meetings while health services are remunerated for patient recruitment and follow-up in recognition of General Practitioner (GP) time.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Service staff and local communities are building research and ear health-related skills, knowledge, and experience. Service staff are regularly trained in research practices and the use of pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry to detect middle ear effusion, during service initiation and monitoring visits, at biannual face-to-face investigator meetings, and via regular trial emails and newsletters. Concurrently, Western Sydney University (WSU) staff are building their understanding of best practice in the implementation of clinical trials in the Aboriginal Health Service setting.</p>

Tympanometry is conducted by a trained research officer (RO), and eligibility, including trace type, is confirmed by the treating General Practitioner (GP). Exclusion criteria include clinical confirmation of a current acute upper respiratory infection, acute otitis media, perforated tympanic membrane, or ventilation tube in situ; ear surgery booked within 1 month of diagnosis; self-reported latex allergy, recent nosebleed (at least 1 nosebleed in last 3 weeks or &gt; 1 nosebleeds in last 6 months); self-reported or documented history of an at-risk condition (e.g., immunosuppression); previous participation in the trial; or self-reported inability to use the autoinflation device (demonstrated by the inability to blow nose).</p>

                <title>Screening/enrolment</title>
                <p id="Par46">Aboriginal Health Services are funded to recruit research officers (ROs) who, with GPs and other health care providers, identify potential participants by reviewing existing health service clinical databases and medical records for children with past and/or current OM. Treating clinicians or their delegate then contact a child’s parent/carer via phone or mail to inform them about the trial and assess their interest in participating. Children of interested parent/carers are invited to attend the health service for formal screening and confirmation of eligibility. Research officers, GPs, and other health care providers also opportunistically screen all children visiting Aboriginal Health Services regardless of the reason for attendance, and at school ear screenings and community health promotion events and, if found eligible, formal screening is offered to confirm eligibility. Children are considered enrolled where eligibility is confirmed by a GP and written informed consent to participate is obtained. Randomisation and baseline assessments are conducted immediately following enrolment (day 0).</p>

                <title>Treatment groups</title>
                <p id="Par47">The intervention group uses a nasal balloon autoinflation device, Otovent® [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], in both nostrils three times daily from baseline (day 0) for up to 3 months. Participants are instructed to temporarily cease autoinflation treatment while symptomatic for no more than 5 consecutive days in the event of an upper respiratory tract infection to minimise the potential for ear pain during autoinflation. Participants cease autoinflation at 1 month if they have bilateral type A, C1, C2, or C3 tympanograms. Those with a type B tympanogram in at least one ear are asked to continue autoinflation for a further 2 months. At 3 months, participants are advised to cease autoinflation irrespective of tympanogram results.</p>
                <p id="Par48">The control group is managed according to Australian treatment guidelines (usual care) and regular follow-up with ROs, without autoinflation. General Practitioners decide usual care taking into consideration a participant’s risk of more severe forms of OM.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants, and alternative therapies are not recommended use during trial participation. All children in the intervention and control groups undergo a hearing assessment by an audiologist at either the Aboriginal Health Service or an audiology service provider. Any participants with bilateral OME or hearing impairment at 3 months are reviewed by a GP for appropriate management, including referral for ENT assessment.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par50">Participants are randomised to the intervention or control group by the RO using an automated Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) located at the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre (NHMRC CTC), Sydney, Australia. The IVRS, accessible by telephone, uses a computer-generated randomisation sequence, enabling immediate 1:1 allocation to unblinded treatment groups. Participants and health service and WSU staff are not blinded to treatment allocation due to the nature of the intervention. Randomisation is stratified using permuted block design (block size 4), based on participating site, child age (3 to 5 years versus 6 to 16 years), and whether unilateral or bilateral OME at presentation. These strata were determined a priori given their potential association with effectiveness.</p>

Data sources, the findings of which are recorded on trial-designed paper source document worksheets, include tympanometry, video pneumatic otoscopy, audiometry, adherence and cost-effectiveness progress questions, an OMQ-14 quality of life questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], nasal autoinflation adherence diary, and qualitative interviews. Medically trained CIs review participant medical records for additional information related to ear disease and treatment including adverse events, health care utilisation, and medication usage, for up to 6 months post-randomisation. This information informs determination of secondary outcomes including the cost-effectiveness analysis. Details of data collection at each of the scheduled assessment times are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

The 15% difference represents a difference between an estimated 35% resolution in the control group and 50% resolution in the treatment group based on a similar trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This 15% absolute difference reduces the 65% non-resolution by approximately a quarter, which is clinically relevant. Assuming a 15% loss to follow-up, 400 children will need to be randomised. This sample size will also detect an effect size of 0.3 (assuming a standardised standard deviation = 1) for continuous secondary outcomes, such as OMQ-14 scores.</p>

                    <p id="Par72">The cost-effectiveness of nasal balloon autoinflation compared to usual care will be measured using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Although quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is often used to measure cost-effectiveness, given the nature of the condition and the relatively short follow-up time of the trial, it is unlikely that QALYs will provide a useful measure of quality of life. Therefore, cost-effectiveness will be determined by the ear-related quality of life measured with the OMQ-14 questionnaire at baseline (day 0) and 1 month. The OMQ14 is a 14-question survey. For the purposes of research, scores are calculated using a weighted scoring system, with high scores indicating poorer outcomes. Medical costs, including medication and health service use, and non-medical costs, including from events related to OME and its treatment, will be calculated from data collected during trial visits. Missing cost-effectiveness data will be managed through imputation, rather than deleting observations. Sensitivity analysis will be performed using both one-way and multi-way Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

This will allow increased understanding of the outcomes of INFLATE, as well as of the implementation of the trial and of how it is received, and allow increased understanding of trial results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. For the process evaluation, a framework approach to analysis will be used to promote a collaborative approach to analysing qualitative data which is useful in research teams with varying experience of conducting qualitative research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition to the process evaluation, qualitative exploration of particular aspects of interest within the trial will be undertaken using the qualitative data generated in the process evaluation, with analysis methods determined by the research question for substudies.</p>

              <p id="Par80">This trial will make an important contribution to the evidence base for the safe and effective management of OME in 3–16-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Australian guidelines recommend the use of nasal balloon autoinflation for the treatment of OME in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], despite limited evidence of efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. There is no evidence to support its use among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The INFLATE trial will fill this gap and provide evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of this treatment alternative in this population. The trial will assess the acceptability of nasal balloon autoinflation compared with usual care with parents and carers, health care providers, and community representatives. INFLATE will report experiences of the trial implementation and governance to inform future randomised controlled trials and research in Aboriginal Health Service settings. The INFLATE trial aims to promote multidirectional learning about ear disease, its impact on hearing, learning, and development, as well as the value of clinical trial co-design and shared Governance in the Aboriginal Health Service setting.</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p id="Par81">At commencement of recruitment to the trial on 21 December 2017, the INFLATE protocol (version 2.0 dated 26/10/2017) described the inclusion of patients with only bilateral OME and primary outcome assessment at 3 months in accordance with standard care OME treatment guidelines at the time. The protocol has since been amended (version 3.0 dated 26/09/2018) to include children with unilateral or bilateral OME, and primary outcome assessment at 1 month. This amendment was initiated in response to slower than anticipated recruitment, and to minimise loss to follow-up and improve adherence to treatment enabling better determination of treatment efficacy, at least in the short term. The change in protocol conforms with similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As at January 2022, 137 patients of the estimated sample size of 400 have been randomised. The unanticipated COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction in children attending health services face to face, and a diversion of human resources to COVID-19 mitigation activities. This has significantly impacted on the ability of health services to recruit participants during 2020 and 2021. The trial is scheduled to cease recruitment on 31 December 2022.</p>

              <p>The INFLATE protocol details the extent of and who can access data during the trial. The protocol states an agreement between the WSU and health services is required before services can commence recruitment. It is within this agreement that access and limits to and ownership of the final data set is defined. Consent to share the final dataset with the broader scientific community was not sought from participating sites and participants at the time of initiation of this trial. Data sharing requests will be managed after being directed to the Steering Committee in the first instance and the corresponding author thereafter. Public access to the full protocol and supporting documentation, including the participant information sheet and consent forms, participant-level dataset, and statistical code, will be granted on reasonable request.</p>
