                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>‘Healthier Wealthier Families’ (HWF) seeks to reduce financial hardship in the early years by embedding a referral pathway between Australia’s universal child and family health (CFH) services and financial counselling. This pilot study investigated the feasibility and short-term impacts of HWF, adapted from a successful Scottish initiative.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Setting: CFH services in five sites across two states, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: Caregivers of children aged 0–5 years experiencing financial hardship (study-designed screen). Design: Mixed methods. With limited progress using a randomised trial (RCT) design in sites 1–3 (March 2020–November 2021), qualitative interviews with service providers identified implementation barriers including stigma, lack of knowledge of financial counselling, low financial literacy, research burden and pandemic disruption. This informed a simplified RCT protocol (site 4) and direct referral model (no randomisation, pre–post evaluation, site 5) (June 2021–May 2022). Intervention: financial counselling; comparator: usual care (sites 1–4). Feasibility measures: proportions of caregivers screened, enrolled, followed up and who accessed financial counselling. Impact measures: finances (quantitative) and other (qualitative) to 6 months post-enrolment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>355/434 caregivers completed the screen (60%–100% across sites). In RCT sites (1–4), 79/365 (19%–41%) reported hardship but less than one-quarter enrolled. In site 5, n=66/69 (96%) caregivers reported hardship and 44/66 (67%) engaged with financial counselling; common issues were utility debts (73%), and obtaining entitlements (43%) or material aid/emergency relief (27%). Per family, financial counselling increased income from government entitlements by an average $A6504 annually plus $A784 from concessions, grants, brokerage and debt waivers. Caregivers described benefits (qualitative) including reduced stress, practical help, increased knowledge and empowerment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Financial hardship screening via CFH was acceptable to caregivers, direct referral was feasible, but individual randomisation was infeasible. Larger-scale implementation will require careful, staged adaptations where CFH populations and the intervention are well matched and low burden evaluation.</p>

              <p>While the mechanisms are complex, it is understood that increased household income benefits children directly through better food, stable housing and healthcare (the investment model), as well as indirectly through improving parental mental health and thus parental capacity (the family stress model).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Healthcare offers avenues for addressing financial hardship; yet, this remains a perennial challenge for services that are designed to treat health symptoms but not their social causes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> In high-income countries with universal welfare platforms such as Australia and the UK, government assistance is available to ease financial stress. However, low take-up of benefits is common, with an estimated 40%–80% of eligible recipients missing out.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A total of 1.3 million Australians were found to be missing out on benefits in 2004,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> when this issue was last publicly addressed. Common explanations for not receiving benefits include lack of awareness, system complexity and stigma.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>Across many high-income countries, financial counselling services are freely available to help people overcome barriers to accessing entitlements and other financial supports, typically funded by governments. In Australia, however, services remain embedded in not-for-profit organisations and unconnected to the broader system.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Our systematic review of health-financial linkage models for families with children aged 0–5 years identified only four international models, with limited randomised trial-level evidence.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Substantial benefits were demonstrated by a Scottish referral model (‘Healthier Wealthier Children’), which engaged health workers in early years services to identify and refer eligible caregivers to money advice workers. Two pre–post evaluations conducted between 2010 and 2013 reported average annual financial gains per caregiver of £1661 (n=2516) and £1919 (n=2289).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Positive spill-over effects included improved health, housing and quality of life. By 2020, 10 years after it began, it had generated 27 000 referrals and over £36 million in financial gain, and is now a requirement of Scotland’s Child Poverty action plan.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>The current study, ‘Healthier Wealthier Families’ (HWF), sought to adapt the Scottish model to the Australian service context and evaluate the model via a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Specific aims were to test the (1) feasibility of the HWF referral model and (2) short-term impacts on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and use of financial services. The overarching goal was to inform the methods and resourcing for a definitive, multisite effectiveness trial that would test whether the HWF model could reduce financial hardship for Australian families when delivered at scale.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>Australia’s universal Child and Family Health (CFH) services offer free, community-based healthcare to families with children from birth to school entry. Available in all Australian jurisdictions, CFH services are delivered by nurses, often in partnership with allied health providers and working with interpreters as needed. The services are mostly clinic-based and offer broad ranging support for children’s health, development and parental well-being. In some jurisdictions, CFH services offer higher intensity support (more, longer and home-based appointments) for families experiencing increased health risks and social adversity. These service streams are differentiated with the labels ‘universal’ and ‘higher intensity’ throughout.</p>
                <p>Australian CFH services already identify and respond to adverse experiences such as poor parental mental health and family violence. While the service frameworks recognise financial hardship as a social adversity affecting child and family outcomes, there is a gap in practice in systematically identifying and responding to this need. The HWF pilot was tested with CFH services in lower socioeconomic communities in Australia’s two most populous states, Victoria and New South Wales. The study was planned before the COVID-19 pandemic, but implementation and evaluation occurred during the pandemic and were deeply impacted by Australia’s public health restrictions and economic responses. In brief, stay-at-home orders (lockdown) were Australia’s main measure of disease control until November 2021, when vaccination levels reached 70%–80%. This required CFH and financial counselling services to shift to telehealth within weeks, and saw many CFH services seconded to other pandemic-related duties. To offset the economic fallout of lockdown, the government implemented a range of financial supplements and supports in April 2020. By September 2020, this financial response had reduced poverty and housing stress beyond prepandemic levels; however, financial hardship had rebounded a year later after financial supports were withdrawn.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For more information on Australia’s pandemic responses, please see the detailed description in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material 1</xref>.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>When the HWF pilot study was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Controlled Trials Registry (ACTRN12620000154909, 13 February 2020), it was designed as a feasibility RCT in one Victorian site. However, implementation and evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic required protocol iterations developed through continuous quality improvement, which incorporated quantitative and qualitative elements. When recruitment ended on 30 June 2022, we had attempted iterations of HWF in five sites across two states. Overall, the model was infeasible in sites 1–4 and feasible in site 5. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the progression and design elements of the study. Recruitment began in site 1 in March 2020, before pausing 5 weeks later in response to Australia’s national lockdown (and eventually ended in 2021 without recommencing). In early-2020, partnerships were formed with sites 2 and 3, reflected by updates to the trial registry (2 March 2021) and the published protocol (<ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044488" ext-link-type="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044488</ext-link>, accepted 4 May 2021).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

The intervention follows usual service delivery, which is tailored to a caregiver’s personal and financial needs. For non-English-speaking clients, it is usual practice to deliver the service via a multilingual counsellor, or with an independent telephone interpreter. Following allocation to the intervention, a referral with the participant’s contact information was emailed to the financial counsellor intake address, and a financial counsellor assigned. The financial counsellor contacted the participant to arrange the first appointment, which included confirming contact and demographic details; ascertaining capacity to make financial decisions; discussing and prioritising financial needs; and planning for working together. Caregivers were asked to gather and send paperwork to financial counsellors or external agencies and assisted by the financial counsellor to complete forms in a timely and accurate manner. Financial counsellors often contact and negotiate with creditors on a caregiver’s behalf. Each participant had as many appointments with the financial counsellor as they needed, over an unbounded period (unrelated to the study timeline).</td>

                <p>The above themes and findings informed iterations to the HWF protocol that were trialled with two new sites (sites 4 and 5, commencing mid-late 2021, see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>), described next.</p>

                <title>Design iterations</title>
                <p>For site 4, the RCT protocol was simplified. Research processes such as informed consent and questionnaires were shortened, and follow-up was reduced from two caregiver surveys at 3 and 6 months to one at 6 months (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>More substantive design changes were implemented for site 5. Instead of an RCT, the model employed direct referral with a pre–post evaluation (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Researcher-led processes were replaced with short, CFH-led consent and evaluation using data collected by financial counsellors rather than surveys collected by the research team. The individual randomisation was removed so there was no control group. This meant that rather than the researcher doing the referral, it was done by the CFH provider at the time of the screening survey. This made it possible for the research team to support the CFH and financial counselling providers to build trusted, working relationships with one another. The design also reflected how the referral pathway would operate in the real-world context, that is, without a researcher intervening between screening and referral.</p>
                <p>In January–June 2022, we conducted a second phase of the implementation evaluation to understand barriers to and enablers of feasibility in sites 4–5 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, methods in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). This included interviews with four CFH providers in site 4, and one CFH provider and one financial counsellor in site 5 (no financial counsellors in site 4 were interviewed because no caregivers engaged, see the Results section). The themes regarding feasibility aligned with those identified in the first phase of the implementation evaluation and summarised above, so they are synthesised together in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>. We conducted interviews with eight caregivers in site 5 who engaged with financial counselling to understand perceived impacts of the HWF model (methods described in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The results are presented as main findings in the next section. Due to the low levels of enrolment in sites 1–4, no caregiver interviews were conducted.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Patients and service providers were involved in the design and conduct of this research. During the feasibility stage, the choice and acceptability of financial hardship items was informed by discussions with CFH providers and financial counsellors, and between CFH providers and their clients. During the implementation evaluation, the trial processes were reviewed with providers in sites 2–5 and caregivers in site 5. Once the trial is published, findings (in academic and lay outputs) will be available on the study website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.rch.org.au/ccch/Healthier_wealthier_families/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.rch.org.au/ccch/Healthier_wealthier_families/</ext-link>).</p>

The participant flow for caregivers is presented as a CONSORT diagram in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>. Across the five sites, CFH providers approached a total of n=434 caregivers. In the four sites where a small number of CFH providers did HWF screening each week, 75%–100% of caseloads were approached. In site 4, where all 11 nurses did screening each week, 20% of the caseload was approached. Across the five sites, a total of n=355 caregivers completed the screening survey (ranging 60%–100% of those approached). Reasons for declining screening were collected in sites 1 and 5 and comprised: no interest or need for financial assistance (n=7), too personal (n=1) and no reason provided (n=8).</p>

Of these, 58 (73%) caregivers expressed interest in the study. Three caregivers were identified as high priority for asset loss or other social risk and immediately referred (see methods in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>); 10 caregivers were allocated (6 intervention and 4 control); and 45/58 (78%) were lost to follow-up. Of 13 enrolled caregivers, 5 completed a follow-up questionnaire (all from sites 1 and 2). In the direct referral model in site 5, 64/67 caregivers were referred, and the financial counsellor was able to contact 49/64 (77%). In total, 44/64 (69%) engaged with the service, which included having service provision (follow-up) data recorded and provided by the financial counsellor.</p>

                  <p>In site 3, the two caregivers who were allocated to the control group subsequently identified as high priority and were referred to financial counselling. All six caregivers enrolled in site 3 engaged with the financial counsellor, but no follow-up data were provided. Across the other RCT sites, no other intervention or priority 1 caregivers engaged with the financial counsellor. In site 5, where there were 44 attending caregivers, all appointments were conducted by phone due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Two-thirds of caregivers used one appointment; 14% used two appointments; 16% used three appointments and 2% used four appointments. Four caregivers missed one appointment and two caregivers missed two, and all were rescheduled. The financial counsellor spent an average of 1.9 hours (SD 1.1) in meetings with attending caregivers (range 0.5–4.75 hours), and an average of 2.2 hours (SD 2.2) outside of meetings on each caregiver’s case (range 0.5–11 hours). By 6 months postreferral, cases were fully closed for 32/44 (73%) caregivers and partially closed (mostly due to disengagement) for 12/44 (27%).</p>
                  <p>In site 5, the most common issues facing caregivers were utility debts (32/44, 73%), awaiting government entitlements (‘Centrelink’, 19/44, 43%) and needing material aid or emergency relief (12/44, 27%). Eighteen per cent of caregivers had borrowed from friends and families; other debts and loans were less frequent. While no caregivers faced bankruptcy, half the caregivers disclosed priority 1 indicators, such as imminent eviction or disconnection of utilities, or being threatened with legal action (n=17/44 (39%) for each category).</p>

Across the five sites, approximately 60% of caregivers who enrolled were partnered, and the number of children in their care ranged 1–7. Caregivers tended to have low levels of education and low household income (noting $A50 000 per annum approximated the poverty line for a family with two adults and two children). While most enrolled caregivers were not in paid work (n=7/12 in sites 1–4 and n=41/44 in site 5), some expressed a desire for more employment (n=3/9 in sites 1–4 and n=18/44 in site 5). The enrolled caregivers in sites 1–4 were more likely to have been born in Australia and speak English at home. In contrast, of the n=44 caregivers in site 5 who engaged with financial counselling, three-quarters were born overseas and just over half spoke languages other than English at home. Just under half lived with a household member with a disability or special healthcare needs. In site 5, the small number of caregivers who were referred to financial counselling but lost to follow-up (n=5) appeared broadly similar to those who engaged.</p>

                  <p>In site 5, at the final appointment, the financial counsellor invited 39 caregivers to take part in the qualitative interview on behalf of the research team. Ten caregivers agreed and eight took part including one with an interpreter. Of the two who were not interviewed, one was unavailable at their scheduled time, and one was lost due to difficulties in finding an interpreter in their first language. Demographic characteristics were not collected due to ethical approval being only available for deidentified data sharing.</p>

                  <title>Caregiver perspectives (site 5)</title>
                  <p>Caregivers who engaged with financial counselling were unanimous in finding the intervention beneficial. Four core themes (benefits) emerged and are presented with illustrative quotes, noting some overlap between themes.</p>
                  <p>Theme 1: Reduced stress and gratitude for emotional support and advocacy received.</p>
                  <p>Caregivers described their relationship with the financial counsellor as being empathetic and respectful. The supportive nature of this relationship helped reduce the acute sense of burden and isolation caregivers were experiencing.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>My financial counsellor was very supportive. She said you are not alone, there are people out there who are experiencing the same thing. So, she had a good talk to me, and after talking to her, I was able to put myself together. [CAREGIVER 4]</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Caregivers were grateful for the opportunity to share their problems with a trusted and supportive service provider who listened, and for the strong advocacy they received. They experienced unexpected relief from the sense of pressure and hopelessness they had been feeling before referral to the financial counsellor.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>… it’s like you’re sharing your feelings with someone. So I was just … I couldn’t speak to anybody about it. So, she’s the one who I am open with … open myself and explain my situation. And I got a very positive response from that time, so it was easy for me after that. [CAREGIVER 13]</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Theme 2: Immediate solutions: crisis management and practical changes to organisation of finances.</p>
                  <p>Caregivers described several ways in which the financial counsellor assisted them. These included acting as a buffer between the caregiver and creditors; helping caregivers manage debt and bills, access entitlements to maximise their income and prevent a debt spiral; and supporting caregivers to prioritise bill payments according to their goals and needs.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>She was talking to me in a way that made me feel that she would take care of everything. ‘Don't worry, I will have the payments divided into instalments’ … She helped me organize myself. She showed me how to organize my bills and how to make payments. [CAREGIVER 2]</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>This proactive and practical support provided caregivers immediate reprieve.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>Because it was a big stress, for me, because always [Utility Company] send me notice—you’re late to pay, you’re late to pay. I can’t pay anyway, I can’t do it, and I was worry. You know, they send me always notice, notice … if they cut electricity, it’s hard because winter, cold, kids. So hard … So, I was so happy when I get [help]. [CAREGIVER 8]</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Theme 3: Increased knowledge and clarity.</p>
                  <p>Caregivers had increased awareness of the support and options available and that they were entitled to access. Caregivers described the personalised advice about finances provided by the financial counsellor.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>That’s why it was really useful … she really helped with things that we have no idea existed. Can’t find information on. So it was very informative. [CAREGIVER 3]</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Caregivers valued the opportunity to ask questions when they did not understand something, and have their questions answered by a trusted service provider who understood their circumstances.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>What I felt when they helped me with how to make payments and how to organise myself. I told you; my parents are overseas. I thought it was like a family. My father teaching me how to make payments and how to organize myself. That’s my feeling.[CAREGIVER 2]</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Theme 4: Well-being, self-efficacy and empowerment</p>
                  <p>Caregivers described improvements in their confidence and outlook, including more capacity and efficacy as a parent.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>But my social worker and financial counsellor has been able to uplift me to make that priority along with my family’s needs and open my mind and eyes to see that everything has to be on time, not to burden myself to make things worse. I know my daughter needs my attention, but I know now I have to do this first in order to be able to look after her the right way. [CAREGIVER 4]</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Caregivers also described having increased control of their personal situation, more stability and feeling less stranded and stressed.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>I just can say that it is very good that if woman like me will be aware that you can raise your voice and there is help … we should have more resources to have knowledge that we can go to this way. I think it’s the best way if … we have more awareness for the woman who they are like me … that there is help. No matter what situation you are in, there is help. [CAREGIVER 5]</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This Australian pilot study aimed to test the feasibility and short-term impacts of a systematic referral pathway between universal CFH and financial counselling services. While financial hardship screening by CFH providers was broadly acceptable to caregivers of young children, a feasible referral model was established in only one of five sites. Challenges to implementation were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Online supplemental figure 2</xref> summarises the key elements, enabling ingredients and benefits of HWF. Feasibility was enabled when screening was viewed by CFH providers as adding value to practice; direct referral was embedded between services; research activities were minimal; strong working relationships between services were enabled by the research team; CFH providers conducted longer, home-based visits and financial hardship was highly prevalent. When the feasible model was developed, financial counselling created average gains in household income from government benefits of $A125 p/week, plus additional payments totalling $A784. This is substantial given that 80% of households earned less than $A1000 per week (which approximated the Australian government’s poverty line for a family with two adults and two children). While we were unable to collect quantitative data on non-financial benefits, in qualitative interviews caregivers described benefits including reduced stress and gratitude, accessing immediate solutions to their financial issues, increased knowledge and clarity, and well-being, self-efficacy and empowerment.</p>
              <p>Australian policies are increasingly recognising the role of healthcare in addressing early adversities<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>; however, there is a dearth of research in Australia and internationally on the implementation and benefits of asking about early adversity in healthcare.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> In the three pilot sites delivering universal CFH services, the 20%–41% of caregivers disclosing financial hardship was comparable with Australian population level data (also collected in 2020–2021) showing that one in three families could not afford essential items.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the feasible HWF model (site 5), two-thirds of eligible caregivers engaged with financial counselling and the financial gains and sources (eg, predominately government benefits) were similar to those in the Scottish evaluations, where engagement ranged 45%–54%.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> The Scottish history offers a way forward for extending the potential of the Australian model, such as engaging other early years services (eg, antenatal or early education and care) and modifying the delivery of financial counselling through colocated or outreach services.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>Strengths of this study included the iterative, dynamic approach to piloting in five sites across two Australian states. Adaptation of the protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled identification of design components that contributed to feasibility. Recognised by the dynamic sustainability framework,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> this approach is integral to achieving feasible, impactful implementation—and is core to the sustainability of the Scottish programme. Our study prioritised families who are often excluded from research<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and used a pragmatic and high quality mixed-methods approach. The qualitative implementation evaluation was critical for understanding the experiences of caregivers and providers, and together with the costs and resourcing used for the pilot, can inform the development and implementation of financial screening via healthcare on a larger scale in Australia and other high-income countries with comparable service systems.</p>
              <p>Limitations include the small sample sizes and limited demographic data for describing the qualitative cohorts; the short-term follow-up; lack of control group; and lack of quantitative data on non-financial impacts. In site 5, the pre–post evaluation could have provided a self-control design if pre-enrolment experiences of financial activities (eg, counselling, use of MoneySmart, legal aid) were measured. Further, the high levels of missing data on emotional well-being measures reflected the difficulty in embedding new measures into CFH and financial counselling practice. Indeed, the latter does not typically inquire about caregivers’ mental health needs because it can require a therapeutic response that is outside the scope of practice. Of the available data, there were high levels of emotional distress (low well-being) at screening and intake. While it was reassuring that the available measures (MGMQ and PWI) demonstrated higher emotional well-being at follow-up than intake, the sample sizes were too small to draw conclusions. The substantive challenges encountered in developing a feasible model of HWF (sites 1–4), and collecting quantitative data on non-financial impacts to enable evaluation of a feasible model (site 5) highlight the challenges that are inherent in conducting a definitive multisite effectiveness trial of HWF. Any implementation at scale will require careful and staged adaptations that test how HWF can benefit communities in the ‘post-COVID-19’ landscape. This includes matching of population characteristics to the healthcare intervention, and low burden evaluation through routine data collection. However, we anticipate that the HWF model would become more feasible in the postpandemic context, especially as financial supports ended, and cost-of-living pressures increased.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
              <p>The intention of HWF is to use universal healthcare to screen and respond to financial hardship, to prevent financial crisis and its negative impacts on children and families. The sizeable proportion of caregivers disclosing financial hardship in the universal CFH services was commensurate with the low socioeconomic status of the participating sites. Even so, screening for financial hardship challenged many providers’ perception of their model of care. The levels of financial hardship did not outweigh other negatives such as stigma, lack of knowledge of financial counselling, the burden of the research processes or the pandemic disruption. There are parallels between this study and evaluation of the roll-out of family violence screening by CFH services in Victoria, which found that CFH providers selectively screened women about family violence.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Nurses avoided screening all women—typically those with lower incomes who are more likely to experience family violence—because of ongoing individual and system practice barriers experienced when identifying and responding to needs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Unsurprisingly, in our pilot, implementing HWF was more feasible for CFH providers already providing higher intensity, outreach support. It was in a site where almost all families were experiencing financial hardship that the HWF model added sufficient value to providers and caregivers for use. In sites where universal CFH services are provided, a tiered care model of those screening to have psychosocial adversity being supported via an integrated child and family programme (eg, a ‘one stop shop’ hub) incorporating HWF model might increase acceptability and engagement with the programme.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The challenge for the Australian health system is that interventions to address financial hardship traditionally sit ‘outside’ the sector. This results in substantial health system inefficiencies and increased health burdens and costs.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Health services alone cannot redress the negative health impacts of financial hardship. The complexity of this challenge can only be meaningfully addressed by integrated, multisectoral and multidisciplinary approaches. As inflation and cost of living increases, we need sustainable and cost-effective responses to financial hardship and its effects on families in the early years. There is an argument for reorienting universal services such as CFH to address the adverse social conditions facing families and driving inequitable outcomes for children and parents.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref></p>
