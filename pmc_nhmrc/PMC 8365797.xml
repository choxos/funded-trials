                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>In the Greater Mekong Subregion, community health workers, known as malaria volunteers, have played a key role in reducing malaria in the control phase, providing essential malaria services in areas with limited formal healthcare. However, the motivation and social role of malaria volunteers, and testing rates, have declined with decreasing malaria burden and reorientation of malaria programmes from control to elimination. Provision of additional interventions for common health concerns could help sustain the effectiveness of volunteers and maintain malaria testing rates required for malaria elimination accreditation by the WHO.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The Community-delivered Integrated Malaria Elimination (CIME) volunteer model, integrating interventions for malaria, dengue, tuberculosis, childhood diarrhoea and malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-negative fever, was developed based on global evidence and extensive stakeholder consultations. An open stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial, randomised at the volunteer level, will be conducted over 6 months to evaluate the effectiveness of the CIME model in Myanmar. One hundred and forty Integrated Community Malaria Volunteers (ICMVs, current model of care) providing malaria services in 140 villages will be retrained as CIME volunteers (intervention). These 140 ICMVs/villages will be grouped into 10 blocks of 14 villages, with blocks transitioned from control (ICMV) to intervention states (CIME), fortnightly, in random order, following a 1-week training and transition period. The primary outcome of the trial is blood examination rate determined by the number of malaria RDTs performed weekly. Difference in rates will be estimated across village intervention and control states using a generalised linear mixed modelling analytical approach with maximum likelihood estimation.</p>

                  <p>This study will provide the first quantitative evidence, using a rigorous design and methodology, to evaluate whether malaria volunteers delivering expanded interventions for common health concerns (CIME model) can increase the effectiveness of malaria volunteers in malaria elimination programmes</p>

                  <p>The intervention was developed in collaboration with the Myanmar National Malaria Control Program and the study will measure implementation research outcomes such as effectiveness of the intervention measured by malaria blood testing rate, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and fidelity.

                  <p>The strength of the stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial design is that it will allow investigation of any temporal effects of the intervention both between and within villages and, given certain conditions and appropriate statistical modelling, can offer superior statistical power as it models cluster level error in the outcome more efficiently.</p>

                  <p>The complex sampling strategy will yield a representative trial sample given a set of known population parameters, and this will provide a greater level of external validity to the findings of the trial; and will be a major strength of the research in the context of the intention-to-treat nature of the study.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Since 2000, global malaria-attributable morbidity and mortality has declined significantly, in particular in the South-East Asia region where malaria cases and deaths have reduced by more than 70%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, emerging resistance to the first-line treatment for malaria, the artemisinin derivatives, in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) threatens progress towards regional, and global, malaria milestones.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> To end the malaria epidemic and to stop the spread of resistance in, and from, the GMS, the global conceptual framework of malaria has changed in recent years from control to elimination, with the WHO and Asia-Pacific leaders having committed to eliminate malaria from the region by 2030.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref></p>
              <p>In the GMS, community health workers, known as malaria volunteers, have played a key role in reducing the malaria burden in the malaria control phase, providing essential malaria services in rural areas where the coverage of formal health services is limited.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, the community-delivered models that have worked well for malaria control may not work well for malaria elimination. In Myanmar, and many other GMS countries, in parallel with the switch from interventions for malaria control to elimination, the motivation and social role of malaria volunteers has dropped along with the declining malaria burden.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As the proportion of febrile illnesses attributable to malaria declines, malaria volunteers are less likely to be able to treat a case of febrile illness, and their perceived utility in the community is compromised.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> As a result, malaria testing rates have declined in many areas,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> threatening progress towards achieving Myanmar’s National Plan for Malaria Elimination<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> recommendation of an optimal annual blood examination rate of 10% and above for populations at risk (the annual blood examination rate in 2016–2018 was 6.1%<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Blood examination rate targets are designed to accurately quantify the annual parasite incidence, a critical indicator to activate the malaria elimination programme in Myanmar and ultimately for achieving WHO certification of malaria elimination.</p>
              <p>Provision of an expanded range of volunteer-delivered services to the community is a potential strategy to provide more opportunities for malaria volunteers to test for malaria and to maintain the annual blood examination rates at the recommended level. This rationale is supported by studies that demonstrate that additional care packages can increase the utilisation of malaria volunteers. For example, the Integrated Community Case Management programme in which malaria volunteers deliver case management for malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea, as well as malnutrition screening and nutrition counselling to children under five has demonstrated good acceptability and effectiveness in reducing under five mortality and malaria burden in Africa,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref> as well as in pilot studies in Myanmar.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Similarly, in a recent observational study in Myanmar, malaria volunteers providing a basic healthcare package (that included management for respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea and skin infections, detection and treatment of acute malnutrition, active case detection and referral of tuberculosis (TB) and referral for other severe illnesses) saw an increase in the volunteers’ blood examination rate using malaria RDTs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>Recognising the challenge of sustaining malaria testing in an elimination setting, the Myanmar National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) commenced a national roll out of the Integrated Community Malaria Volunteer (ICMV) model in 2017–18.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This programme expanded the scope of malaria volunteers to include additional screening and referral services for other diseases including dengue, lymphatic filariasis, TB, HIV/AIDS and leprosy (detailed description in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material 1</xref>).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, introduction of the ICMV model did not result in a significant improvement in the annual blood examination rate, which plateaued at around 6% between 2016 and 2018.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> While the rationale behind service integration in the ICMV programme is strong, the choice of additional services offered by the ICMVs could be improved by incorporating the perspectives of the end users (community members/leaders and current volunteers) and malaria stakeholders (NMCP and other malaria implementing partners). Improvement of the current malaria volunteer model may increase rates of malaria testing in the elimination phase. To address this, in collaboration with the NMCP, we undertook a global literature review and qualitative research study engaging key community and malaria stakeholders in Myanmar to explore perspectives and identify strategic and operational barriers and enablers of malaria elimination in community-delivered models.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 20 21</xref> Based on the evidence from these primary stages, and in further collaboration with the NMCP, we designed an optimal intervention package for malaria volunteers to deliver in the elimination phase known as ‘The Community-delivered Integrated Malaria Elimination model (The CIME model)’. This model is specific to the GMS context of elimination and offers services for malaria elimination, dengue, TB, non-malaria fever and childhood diarrhoea, whereas some interventions previously included in the ICMV model (for lymphatic filariasis, HIV and leprosy) have been removed. It is designed to execute all essential community-based interventions of the malaria elimination programme, and maintain high rates of testing for malaria in the community by providing treatment and prevention for other key diseases. If proven to be effective and endorsed by the Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports, implementation of the CIME model could contribute to achieving the national malaria elimination goal of 2030 by maintaining high annual blood examination rates and ultimately fulfilling the requirements of malaria elimination certification by WHO.</p>

Where possible, RDT cassettes will be kept and stored as per standard operating procedures (<xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material 3</xref>) to extract DNA and antibodies to determine secondary molecular and serological outcomes 2C and 2L-2N (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). At the end of the intervention trial, a mixed-method study will be conducted (<xref rid="SP4" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material 4</xref>) to collect data on secondary outcomes 2O-2R. This will include a cross-sectional survey of community members in selected villages to explore the acceptability of the CIME model and feasibility of implementing the CIME model in their community. A qualitative study involving semistructured interviews for key health stakeholders and community leaders and focus group discussion (FGD) with CIME volunteers will be conducted. A qualitative study involving observational fieldwork of CIME volunteers (2–4 ICMVs per township) will be conducted to observe their daily activities. Finally, a cost-analysis of the CIME model will be undertaken (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

In this approach, the CIME model intervention will be implemented sequentially in a minimum of 140 villages serviced by 140 CIME volunteers. All the community members in sampled villages will receive the CIME model intervention, but the timing of the intervention implementation will be determined at random using a computerised random allocation sequence with de-identified village data. The randomisation process will be performed using randomisation code written by the trial statistician. Villages will be randomly allocated, independent of geographical location, to 10 ordered blocks of 14 villages, with blocks transitioned from control (ICMV) to intervention (CIME) states at fortnightly intervals following a 1-week training and transition period, beginning in July 2021 (the October/November peak in malaria transmission during the 6-month study period). This follows an initial 2-week baseline control period at the start of the study where all village sites will use the ICMV model exclusively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). The primary outcome, number of blood examinations by RDT undertaken, will be measured weekly. All ICMV volunteers in the villages of the same block will be trained as CIME volunteers at the same time (in the same week) and will subsequently transition to CIME volunteers (the intervention state). Training periods will not contribute data to the trial.</p>

At the first stage, two townships from each of the four included states/regions (Ayeyarwaddy, Yangon, Bago, Kayah) will be sampled randomly with probability proportional to the size of the township. At the second stage, a fixed number of 18 villages will be sampled at random from each selected township to provide equal selection probabilities for villages. The number of villages sampled in each township is inflated for an expected village-level non-response of approximately 3%.</p>

                  <p>The difference in rates of the primary outcome, blood examination rate as measured by the number of RDTs conducted by volunteers, will be estimated across intervention and control states (intention-to-treat, given the study is estimating effectiveness) using generalised linear (eg, Poisson or negative-binomial link functions) mixed modelling with maximum likelihood estimation. Given the dependencies in the longitudinal data, village and time will be modelled as crossed random effects and study group as a time-varying monotonic factor adjusted for both time and seasonality. Heterogeneity in the effect of the intervention will be explored through estimation of a village-specific random effect in extended modelling. Temporal and spatial trends of RDT testing will also be explored including analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention across the study period. Additional, per-protocol type analyses involving intervention by effect moderator interactions will also be undertaken to estimate the extent to which different levels of intervention fidelity (assessed by a range of factors relating to village level acceptability and performance of the application of the intervention) impact RDT testing. Analyses of secondary outcomes and population demographics will involve a similar methodological approach, with link functions and response distributions specific to outcome type. In both descriptive and primary outcome trial analyses, sampling weights will be derived and applied in analyses where village selection probabilities are not equal—possible if the achieved number of villages sampled across townships varies. Furthermore, cluster robust standard errors will be used in all descriptive analyses given the complex sampling design. Data analysis for the stepped-wedged cluster randomised controlled trial will be performed using STATA V.15.</p>

Economic costs will be estimated from a health systems perspective, for screening, treatment and referral services provided by the CIME volunteers (eg, excluding secondary costs for services they are referred to). A programme experience approach will be used, supplemented by consultations with the NMCP to capture any costs that are missed (eg, due to integration / reliance on existing services). Itemised costs from the study will be available and classified as implementation related or ongoing. The resulting cost outcomes will be used to estimate the cost per additional RDT resulting from the intervention, after 1 year and by 2030.</p>

                <title>Informed consent</title>
                <p>Written consent will be obtained by researchers from ICMV participants before data collection and implementation of CIME model. As community members will continue receiving health services from the volunteer, either ICMV or CIME, no written consent will be obtained from the community members who receive services. The written consent forms and consent waiver request (<xref rid="SP5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental material 5</xref>) have been submitted and approved by Institutional Review Board, Myanmar Department of Medical Research to waive the need for an informed consent with regards to the collection, storage and further laboratory analysis of the RDT cassettes that would otherwise be discarded after use by study volunteers.</p>
                <p>If an ICMV participant withdraws from the study during implementation, data collection pertaining to that person will stop but data participants provided before withdrawal from the study will be included in the analysis. If a volunteer withdraws, they will return to practicing as an ICMV volunteer and will continue reporting to the Myanmar NMCP as per the requirement of NMCP.</p>
