                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The majority of people with dementia are cared for by their family members. However, family carers are often unprepared for their caring roles, receiving less education and support compared with professional carers. The consequences are their reduced mental and physical health and wellbeing, and that of care recipients. This study protocol introduces the ‘Partnership in iSupport program’ that includes five interventional components: managing transitions, managing dementia progression, psychoeducation, carer support group and feedback on services. This health services research is built on family carer and dementia care service provider partnerships. The aims of the study are to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and family carers’ experiences in the program.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A multicentre randomised controlled trial will be conducted with family carers of people living with dementia from two tertiary hospitals and two community aged care providers across three Australian states. The estimated sample size is 185 family carers. They will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the usual care group. Outcomes are measurable improvements in quality of life for carers and people with dementia, caregiving self-efficacy, social support, dementia related symptoms, and health service use for carers and their care recipients. Data will be collected at three time points: baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-initiation of the intervention.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This is the first large randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention on health and social care services with carers of people living with dementia in real-world practice across hospital and community aged care settings in three Australian states to ascertain the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and carers’ experiences of the innovative program. We expect that this study will address gaps in supporting dementia carers in health and social care systems while generating new knowledge of the mechanisms of change in the systems. Findings will strengthen proactive health management for both people living with dementia and their carers by embedding, scaling up and sustaining the ‘Partnership in iSupport program’ in the health and social care systems.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par7">There were 55.2 million people living with dementia (PLWD) worldwide in 2019 and this number will reach 139 million in 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Up to 80% of PLWD also live with two or more additional chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. People with dementia have more hospital admissions (1.4—4 times), more emergency care uses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and longer hospital stays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] compared to those without dementia. They also frequently experience transitional care across care settings and care service providers due to complex care needs and are particularly vulnerable to gaps in health care and social care services (i.e. the lack of coordination between care settings and care providers) due to their high dependency on others to provide care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Inadequate care and management of health conditions for this vulnerable population pose a great burden and high costs to health care and social care systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Family carers are the cornerstone of helping PLWD remain healthy, reducing unplanned hospital admissions and enabling them to stay at home for as long as they wish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, family carers receive less dementia education compared with professional carers to manage dementia and other complex health issues for PLWD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and receive limited ongoing support. Health services research that incorporates evidence-based practice to enhance support for carers in both hospital and community care settings is scarce. This study protocol reports an innovative and complex intervention to address gaps in supporting dementia carers through health and social care systems.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Similar to other developed countries, Australia has an increasing ageing population many of whom are living with dementia. Currently, there are 487,500 people estimated to be living with dementia in Australia and over 1.6 million people involved in their care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Care services for PLWD after diagnosis are highly fragmented and difficult for carers to navigate and utilise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Many carers feel socially isolated due to time spent on care, stigma and a lack of quality social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Carer stress and distress are widely reported and contribute to poor health and reduced quality of life (QoL) of carers and PLWD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], often resulting in premature permanent admission to nursing home care for PLWD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent study in the USA, using the National Inpatient Sample from 2012 to 2016, revealed that 40% of hospitalisations of PLWD were due to potentially preventable conditions, for example falls, injuries, dehydration, poisoning or uncontrolled chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], strongly suggesting that educating and supporting carers to manage dementia and disease progression can avoid emergency department use and hospital admissions.</p>
              <p id="Par10">We propose a ‘Partnership in iSupport program’ that enables hospitals and community aged care organisations to implement evidence-based dementia care services to strengthen support for family carers of PLWD while tackling current problems in dementia care. There are three key pillars comprising the program: (1) a psychoeducation program for carers to improve their knowledge and skills in managing dementia using the online Australian iSupport for Dementia program; (2) iSupport program facilitators appointed by participating organisations acting as link workers to assist carers to navigate, access and utilise care services to meet the holistic care needs of PLWD; and (3) virtual carer support groups to enhance socialisation and reduce social isolation for carers. A program based on these pillars is viewed as a complex intervention due to its flexibility in delivering new services in real-world practice and needs to consider the mechanisms of change, facilitating factors and recipients of the program in a given health and social care context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Having a link worker who acts as a single point of contact for carers for a minimum of one year post-diagnosis support is a <italic>standard</italic> care service in Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Yet, this kind of support is viewed as an innovative dementia care model in a research paper submitted to the 2018–2020 Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As noted in a recent Australian study, combining the three iSupport components in a single program reflects stakeholders’ expectations for providing a one-stop-shop for PLWD after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The program will use digital technology to improve reach to carers. The ‘Partnership in iSupport program’ conceptual framework is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and discussed in the following sections.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Partnership in iSupport program conceptual framework </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2022_8148_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Psychoeducation and potential impact</title>
                <p id="Par12">Systematic reviews have determined that psychoeducation programs can significantly improve carers’ QoL and self-efficacy and reduce stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The Australian iSupport program is a well-designed psychoeducation program for informal carers and is adapted from a generic version of the World Health Organization (WHO) iSupport for Dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. iSupport embeds holistic care, for example, providing opportunities for PLWD to choose and control activities which are meaningful, enjoyable and relevant to their life experiences. iSupport uses techniques, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, to help carers develop positive thoughts, problem-solving and coping skills, self-care and assertiveness when seeking help from relatives, friends and formal care service providers. The program covers dementia care from an early stage to the end of life. Therefore, it helps carers learn about changes as dementia progresses and take proactive action to gain timely treatment and care. When appropriate, the program introduces dementia care resources and multidisciplinary care services with weblinks for carers to access. The Australian iSupport program currently contains 6 modules and 30 units: introduction to dementia; being a carer; caring for me; providing everyday care; a person-centred care approach to changed behaviour; and my engagement in consumer directed care.</p>

A link worker is essential to bridge care gaps and prevent care crises during transitions between care settings and types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this study, iSupport program facilitators act as link workers.</p>

                <p id="Par14">Carer support groups can significantly reduce stress and improve self-efficacy and QoL for carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Video-streaming meetings facilitated by trained health professionals demonstrates better health outcomes for carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Virtual support groups enable carers to share their knowledge and experiences in dementia care, to learn from role models and to help each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Working carers particularly welcome virtual carer support as they can choose a convenient time to participate.</p>

                <title>Creating reciprocal partnerships to support person-centred care approach</title>
                <p id="Par15">iSupport program facilitators appointed by care service providers will assist carers to identify the individualised care needs of PLWD in a timely manner, especially when the PLWD’s health condition is deteriorating or during transitions between care settings (i.e. hospital-to-home) and care types (i.e. receiving palliative care at home). The facilitator will also assist carers to access and utilise relevant care services and co-plan care activities with carers and PLWD. It is anticipated that these supports will meet the care needs and improve QoL of PLWD, prevent and manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and complications; thus, reducing preventable conditions that contribute to admissions to emergency departments and hospitals for PLWD. Further, the carer support group activities enabled by facilitators in the study will create opportunities and empower carers to provide constructive feedback to care service providers regarding the strengths and weaknesses of services. Their feedback will inform service providers’ continuous quality improvement, organisational development and staff development in caring for people with dementia. Poor quality of care was identified by the recent Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety as a significant issue in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Only 20% of people receiving home care services felt their care needs were always met across all quality of care attributes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The reciprocal partnerships built through the program will have high potential to mitigate these concerns and improve the quality of care.</p>

In phase 1, we worked with carers and care service providers to co-design the intervention to be delivered by iSupport program facilitators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Phase 2 is this RCT. On the completion of the phase 2 study, we will translate the ‘Partnership in iSupport program’ into practice in participating organisations and disseminate the program nationwide (phase 3).</p>

The intervention will last 12 months. A cost effectiveness analysis will be undertaken alongside the RCT. A qualitative descriptive design will be applied to explore carers’ experiences in the program using data from virtual carer support group meetings.

Carers will be notified about each survey by email and an SMS message sent by the research associate. The monthly carer support group meetings will be audio-recorded as data for the qualitative data analysis to understand carers’ experiences in the intervention.</p>

Preparing carers with capabilities to manage dementia and other chronic diseases for PLWD and supporting them to care for themselves are well-recognised strategies to maintain health, wellbeing and quality of life for both carers and PLWD, relieve burden on health and social care systems and reduce health costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

A meta-analysis has also confirmed that a multicomponent intervention has the largest effects, compared to an intervention with a single component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

                <title>Engagement with stakeholders</title>
                <p id="Par58">Successful health services research to implement evidence-based practice in a trial and beyond largely relies on ongoing engagement with stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. We started to engage stakeholders at an early stage by inviting four carers and three staff representatives from the industry partners in the study to review a grant application for the study and by conducting phase 1 of the project to co-develop detailed intervention activities with stakeholders. Most importantly, we will embed the program into routine care services after the trial through the co-designed phase 3 of the project with stakeholders. In addition, the Co-design Advisory Group we formed in the project will continue to advise the project team about stakeholders’ perspectives of the program. These steps are key to ensure policy makers, dementia care service providers and carers accept the program and translate it into practice quickly.</p>

Written informed consent from caregivers and care recipients will be obtained (see Supplementary file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> Information package for carers). In addition, for the care recipients, a verbal consent will be recorded using voice recorder with their informal carer presents. This is to ensure the conversation can be replayed to the care recipients if cognitive condition declines at the later dates. The ethics committee approved this procedure.</p>
