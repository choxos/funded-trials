                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">We have previously shown that service-wide support can increase the odds of alcohol screening in any 2-month period in a cluster randomized trial of service-wide support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS). Here we report an exploratory analysis on whether the resulting pattern of screening was appropriate. Aim: we assess whether that increase in screening was associated with: (i) increased first-time screening, (ii) increased annual screening, (iii) whether frequently screened clients fell into one of four risk categories as defined by national guidelines.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Setting and participants: 22 ACCHS; randomized to receive the support model in the treatment (‘early-support’) arm over 24-months or to the waitlist control arm. Intervention: eight-component support, including training, sharing of experience, audit-and-feedback and resource support. Analysis: records of clients with visits before and after start of implementation were included. Multilevel logistic modelling was used to compare (i) the odds of previously unscreened clients receiving an AUDIT-C screen, (ii) odds of clients being screened with AUDIT-C at least once annually. We describe the characteristics of a sub-cohort of clients who received four or more screens annually, including if they were in a high-risk category.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Of the original trial sample, 43,054 met inclusion criteria, accounting for 81.7% of the screening events in the overall trial. The support did not significantly increase the odds of first-time screening (OR  = 1.33, 95% CI 0.81–2.18, p  = 0.25) or of annual screening (OR  = 0.99, 95% CI 0.42–2.37, p = 0.98). Screening more than once annually occurred in 6240 clients. Of the 841 clients with four or more screens annually, over 50% did not fall into a high-risk category. Females were overrepresented. More males than females fell into high-risk categories.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The significant increase in odds of screening observed in the main trial did not translate to significant improvement in first-time or annual screening following implementation of support. This appeared to be due to some clients being screened more frequently than annually, while more than half remained unscreened. Further strategies to improve alcohol screening should focus on appropriate screening regularity as well as overall rates, to ensure clinically useful information about alcohol consumption.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">In Australia, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS) provide culturally appropriate, holistic health care and make key contributions to improving health outcomes for Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (also respectfully referred to as First Nations Australians) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These services play an important role in addressing health inequalities experienced by their clients. The inequalities include significant harms from alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Alcohol contributes to 8.1% of the health gap between First Nations Australians and other Australians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is despite the fact that more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples than non-Indigenous are current non-drinkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and prevalence of dependence (2.2%) is similar to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, when First Nations Australians people do drink, they consume a median of 78 g of alcohol per occasion, well over the Australian recommended limit to reduce risk of short-term harms, like injury, from alcohol (40 g per occasion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These patterns of drinking and harms have roots in ongoing trauma from colonisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Other Indigenous peoples who have been colonised have suffered increases in harms from alcohol, however, there are very few studies addressing alcohol screening in Indigenous populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Australian guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] recommend that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are screened with a validated tool, such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption (AUDIT-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], ‘as part of an annual health assessment, or opportunistically’. As part of this same guideline, more frequent screening is recommended for high-risk groups including adolescents and young adults, those with high-risk and harmful drinking levels, those with conditions exacerbated by alcohol, and women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Implementation studies in general primary care aim to increase the absolute number of alcohol screening events or patients screened. A recent systematic review showed that 34 of 44 studies aiming to improve alcohol screening resulted in significant increases in rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, none investigated whether such interventions resulted in appropriate screening frequency or regularity. These studies therefore do not provide information on whether screening was clinically appropriate. For example, recommendations for universal opportunistic screening could in theory lead to unnecessarily frequent screening of clients who attend clinics often. Conversely, people with health conditions exacerbated by alcohol or people who are dependent on alcohol may need more frequent than annual screening.</p>
              <p id="Par16">In this paper we report on a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial of a multi-component, service-wide support for ACCHS to increase universal alcohol screening and appropriate treatment. We have previously shown that the support model could increase the odds of a person being screened with AUDIT-C when attending the participating ACCHS in any 2-month period over 24 months of implementation. The increase in odds from baseline to 24 months post-implementation was nearly eight times greater in the treatment arm (OR = 7.95, 95% CI 4.04–15.63, p &lt; 0.001) than in waitlist controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, that study did not investigate whether this increase resulted in clinically appropriate screening frequency or regularity.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Here we explore whether this increase resulted in patterns of screening that are in keeping with recommended guidelines. We thus examined data to answer the following questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par18">Were previously unscreened clients more likely to be screened with AUDIT-C after support commenced?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Were clients in the treatment arm more likely to undergo regular annual screening?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">What proportion of clients was frequently screened within any 12-month period and did these clients fall into high-risk categories?</p></list-item></list></p>

Screening was addressed in multiple components. Training and support emphasised annual screening of all clients aged 16 or older and discussed opportunities for screening (e.g., antenatal checks or when seeing a nurse or Aboriginal health professional), and when not to screen (e.g., in crisis situations).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Description of the support model, with detail on elements relating to screening<sup>a</sup></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Component</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left">A memorandum of understanding outlining the aims of and design of the study, responsibilities of the research team and the service</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">Two-day workshop with two nominated service champions to introduce aims and methods of the study, the support model, and to build a champions’ network.

                <p id="Par24">The treatment arm received support first (the ‘early-support’ arm). The total duration of implementation in the early-support arm was 24 months, consisting of 12 months of active support (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, components 1–8), followed by maintenance support of 12 months (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, components 4–8). During that time the waitlist control services operated as normal and interaction with the researchers occurred only for collection of routinely collected data. At the end of that period, which marked the end of the randomised trial, the waitlist control arm began receiving the full support model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Each observation included the date of the last visit in the preceding 2 months, basic demographic and health information including AUDIT-C score and date of AUDIT-C screen; systolic blood pressure (BP); haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); and the liver enzyme, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Baseline data for 18 months prior to implementation in the early-support arm (28 February 2016–30 August 2017) was obtained for all 22 services. Records for individual clients were matched using patient IDs (with no personal identifiers attached) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>

For this sub-analysis, only records of patients who had not been screened in the baseline period were included (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The outcome measure was whether the patient had at least one recorded AUDIT-C screen on or after the start date of implementation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Construction of analytical samples</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13722_2022_294_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                  <title>Question 2: Systematic annual screening of clients after implementation</title>
                  <p id="Par29">To address question 2, we tested if the support model improved the odds of receiving annual AUDIT-C screening post-implementation (for clients in the early versus waitlist control arms). The 18 months of available baseline data did not enable us to establish if clients were screened annually pre-implementation. However, as data from this trial showed very low rates of baseline screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and as AUDIT-C screening was only made a national key performance indicator for these services in mid-2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we assumed that in most services no annual AUDIT-C screening had occurred prior to implementation. Clients were eligible for inclusion in this analysis if their earliest and latest visits were at least 12 months apart. For each eligible client, consecutive 12-month intervals were constructed from the date of their earliest visit during the study. Each period was defined as occurring pre- or post-implementation based on the latest date of client visit within that period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). A 12-month period for a client with at least one AUDIT-C screen was defined as a ‘screened’ period. All other 12-month periods with at least one visit were considered ‘non-screened’ periods. Clients were considered ‘annually screened’ if all their annual periods that occurred post-implementation were screened periods.</p>

                  <p id="Par30">To address question 3, we investigated characteristics of clients who were frequently screened. We defined a client to be frequently screened if they had four or more AUDIT-C screens recorded in any 12-month period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). Clients were included if there was at least one annual period with visits, regardless of their timing relative to implementation. Clients’ annual periods were classified as pre-, post-, or spanning implementation based on their period start and end dates.</p>
                  <p id="Par31">We investigated what proportion of these clients fell into a high-risk health category based on the clients’ earliest record of AUDIT-C, systolic blood pressure (BP), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT).

                  <p id="Par36">Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. For questions 1 and 2 outcomes for clients within the same service were likely to be correlated.

From January 2019 onwards, one service in the waitlist control arm was unable to provide data due to a change in practice software. For the present analysis, the trial sample was comprised of 89,788 individual clients with observations between 28 February 2016 and 30 August 2019. Of these, there were 43,054 current clients (attended at least once before and once after implementation). The 46,734 clients who were excluded from these analyses accounted for 18.3% (11,163) of all AUDIT-C screening instances recorded between 28 February 2016 and 30 August 2019 (61,075). The mean age and gender distribution in study arms remained the same as in the trial (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), indicating that sample construction processes did not disrupt the gender balance in the trial arms established by randomisation.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Unscreened sample at baseline<sup>a</sup>: characteristics by trial arm</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Characteristic</th><th align="left">Early support</th><th align="left">Waitlist controls</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3">Services</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> n</td><td align="left">11</td><td align="left">11</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Mean clients per service (SD)</td><td align="left">1986 (1109)</td><td align="left">936 (574)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3"> Remoteness</td></tr><tr><td align="left">  Urban and inner regional</td><td align="left">5</td><td align="left">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">  Outer regional and remote</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">  Very remote</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3">Clients</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> n</td><td align="left">21,850</td><td align="left">10,300</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Mean age of clients in years (SD)</td><td align="left">36.8 (15.9)</td><td align="left">37.5 (16.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Number of female clients (%)</td><td align="left">12,412 (56.8)</td><td align="left">5859 (56.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Mean observations<sup>b</sup> per client (SD)</td><td align="left">3.9 (2.6)</td><td align="left">3.9 (2.6)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Baseline period: from 28.02.2016 to 30.08.2017 inclusive</p><p><sup>b</sup>An observation appeared in the dataset for a client if they attended their service for a consultation in the preceding 2-month reference period</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par48">Previous studies have shown that service-level implementation strategies can improve screening rates in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, to our knowledge this is the first controlled trial to report on the effect of a service-level alcohol screening implementation program on screening regularity, in addition to screening rate. We previously showed that the odds of a patient being screened in any 2-month period significantly increased during the 24 months of implementation of support in this cluster randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, in this report we show that this increase in screening rate was not reflected in an increase in odds of previously unscreened clients in the early-support arm being screened for the first time or of clients receiving regular annual screening when compared to controls. We have also found, in some instances, clients may have received unnecessarily frequent screening. For example, among the 2% of clients who were screened frequently (4 or more times annually), we found that there more women than men, and these women were younger than the frequently screened men. These results together show that service-level strategies successful in increasing overall alcohol screening rates may not lead to screening patterns that are in line with recommendations.</p>
              <sec id="Sec20">
                <title>First-time screening and annual screening</title>
                <p id="Par49">Our sample of 43,054 current clients (i.e., those who attended their services both before and after the implementation of support) accounted for most of the instances of AUDIT-C screening in the broader trial (81.7% or 49,912 instances). However, while over 24 months of implementation there was some increase in the odds of any one client being screened for the first time, this was not significant. There was also no effect on the odds of receiving regular annual screening. These results are explained by the distribution of screening records among the clients. Nearly half of these regular clients (20,141) had no AUDIT-C record at all. In contrast 14.5% (6240) had two or more screens in at least one annual period (accounting for 42% of the screens among the 43,054 clients). Mean AUDIT-C scores in screened individuals at baseline in both study arms of the overall trial (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) suggest that screening was not specifically targeting people known to drink heavily (early-support = 3.6, waitlist controls 3.3). This is in keeping with recommendations for universal screening. Repeated screening therefore was likely opportunistic—when the clients presented at the service for any reason or as part of scheduled health checks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par50">A range of factors may have contributed to the fact that the efforts of the services did not result in increased first-time or annual screening. Strategies and processes adopted by the services to increase screening differed. Some services reported trying to implement alcohol screening before a medical consultation for all clients, for example by an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander health worker or nurse. Screening approaches could also differ among individual clinicians. However, whether a client presents and the nature of their presentation influences whether the client is screened or not. For example, if a client presents in a crisis e.g., with severe asthma or bereavement, taking the opportunity to screen for usual alcohol use may be inappropriate. Also, if a client is known to have current severe alcohol dependence, then screening may be deemed unnecessary.</p>
                <p id="Par51">At a systems level, time pressures and high staff turnover prevalent in this health sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] may have contributed to the inconsistent alcohol annual and first-time screening observed in this study. While training resources were available on the website (component 7), the support did not itself include periodic retraining or training with new staff members.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Cultural barriers to screening may also play a role, particularly as alcohol can be a sensitive topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples may be more comfortable to discuss private or sensitive issues with people of the same gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. So, a male patient may be less comfortable talking with a female clinician. Further, cultural compatibility between clinician and client can be important when making clinical assessments relating to mental health of Aboriginal Australians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. So, some clients may be less willing to accept questions about alcohol from clinicians who are not Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, particularly if they do not know them well. On the other hand, community controlled services operate in closely knit communities so there may be instances in which family relationships or cultural restrictions impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers undertaking screening with some clients, contacts or relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] for drinking.</p>

              <sec id="Sec21">
                <title>Was frequent screening appropriate?</title>
                <p id="Par53">National guidelines for preventative care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples recommend more frequent alcohol screening of high-risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, there is no agreed definition of the appropriate frequency of screening. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples experience higher rates of chronic diseases than the general Australian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Monitoring of alcohol consumption may be needed for clients with health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, such as viral hepatitis. These conditions may also require more frequent visits, which present an opportunity for more frequent use of an alcohol screening tool. The 841 clients (2% of current clients) who were screened four or more times in at least one annual period accounted for nearly 11% of screens recorded for current clients. However, in most cases our data did not reveal why those clients were more frequently screened—less than half had elevated biomarkers or AUDIT-C levels.</p>
                <p id="Par54">Females were overrepresented in the frequently screened sample, even though a smaller percentage of females had elevated biomarkers and elevated AUDIT-C than males in this group. They also had a much lower median age. This could suggest that frequent screening was occurring in healthy females, possibly during regular antenatal or reproductive health consultations (e.g., for contraception). Other reasons for frequent health service contact in healthy women could be visiting with dependents, or a greater willingness to seek preventive care or routine health checks than males. Conversely, the higher proportions of individuals with elevated biomarkers in the smaller sample of frequently-screened males might reflect this group seeking healthcare for treatment or monitoring of health conditions more often than attending for a preventive health check.</p>

                <title>Recommendations for policy, practice, and research</title>
                <p id="Par55">Annual screening allows the clinician to detect unhealthy drinking earlier and offer treatment or support, including brief intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Individuals’ drinking patterns can vary over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], including over relatively short periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Further, intermittent drinking patterns can be common among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with drinking triggered by events such as ‘Sorry Business’ (grieving after a bereavement). This means that annual screening rather than one-off is a better way to gain a picture of the individual’s drinking.</p>
                <p id="Par56">In Australia, primary care services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples report on rates of risky drinking based on AUDIT-C scores as part of their national key performance indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. AUDIT-C is particularly suitable in this setting as it is brief and has been validated in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has also been shown to be acceptable to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, though its delivery may need to be adapted for local culture and context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, regular screening with AUDIT-C or any other validated instrument is not otherwise mandated or widely promoted. For example, screening with a validated instrument such as AUDIT-C is not included in the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ annual health check templates. Similarly, such screening is not required for the Medical Benefits Scheme to reimburse services for the conduct of the annual health assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The health assessment uptake rates vary from about 20% per year in 15–24 year olds to over 40% in people aged 65 and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These rates are greater than the AUDIT-C screening rates shown in this study (12.7% based on 18-months’ baseline, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). So, incorporating AUDIT-C in this assessment could improve detection and increase annual screening rates.</p>
                <p id="Par57">Refining strategies to reach unscreened adults should be considered. In addition to screening when clients present to the service, opportunities for outreach alcohol screening could be employed. For example, some ACCHS already engage their clients through activities outside of the clinic setting, which takes various forms, including camps or community gatherings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Indeed, some participating services mentioned conducting screening in the community and updating records in practice software. Strategies to support these kinds of activities should be included in future designs.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Results of this analysis show that successful strategies designed to increase universal alcohol screening may lead to repeated screening of a particular group of clients rather than necessarily increasing screening in an unscreened or underscreened group. As alcohol use is a sensitive topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], broaching the subject too frequently could lead to the client becoming irritated or avoiding contact with the service. So, it is important that services and research studies clarify an optimal frequency of screening or monitoring for different clinical situations. Initiatives designed to improve screening and treatment for unhealthy alcohol use should ensure that training and monitoring of outcomes include consideration of the appropriate frequency and regularity of screening.</p>
                <p id="Par59">Identifying and addressing potential clinician and client barriers to screening, including those determined by cultural norms should be incorporated into improvement programs. Programs that incorporate audit-and-feedback cycles such as those based on continuous quality improvement (CQI), would be suited to this due to their iterative nature. After the initial cycle that aims to increase implementation of screening, these programs could then focus on screening regularity. Practice software can be an important tool in these efforts. Aside from its role in providing data for monitoring service improvement, services could choose to implement further modifications to help facilitate more appropriate screening frequency such as automated screening reminders based on clients’ prior records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, services participating in this study have pointed out that too many reminders can interfere with clinical practice.</p>

              <sec id="Sec23">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par60">This study is a post-hoc analysis of data from a larger trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], to explore potential unwanted effects of the intervention, and to scrutinize if the benefits were as significant as they appeared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. More than half of that clients from that broader study population were excluded from the analysis because they had not attended the service during the baseline period. A longer baseline could have allowed more clients to be included in analyses investigating first-time screening. The same limited availability of pre-implementation data prevented us from determining the levels of annual screening before implementation and therefore we had to limit this analysis to the comparison of study arms post-implementation. However, our assumption of the absence of regular annual AUDIT-C screening is supported by generally low screening levels at baseline.</p>
                <p id="Par61">While the training provided to services emphasised annual screening of clients as best-practice, several aspects of the support model may have resulted in efforts that prioritised increasing number of screening events rather than increasing annual or first-time screening. These included suggestions for opportunistic screening, including during pre-consultation examinations or antenatal checks. Further, regular feedback reports presented a graph of change in bi-monthly screening rates (as well as summary of screening in the last 12-months). They did not include details on first-time screening events, or over-frequent screening of clients. The duration of the trial would not have allowed for reporting on effect of the intervention on numbers of clients screened annually. Barriers and facilitators of appropriate screening regularity were not specifically discussed during champion teleconferences.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p id="Par62">Despite previously demonstrating a marked increase in the odds of screening occurring in any 2-month period with service-wide support, we were unable to show significant increases in clients screened for the first time or in annual screening of clients over 24 months of implementation of support. This appeared to be due to an uneven distribution of screening, with a small percentage of clients being screened more frequently than annually while nearly half clients were not screened at all. Females tended to be overrepresented among the more frequently screened clients. Further strategies to improve alcohol screening should focus on appropriate regularity as well as rate of screening in order to garner clinically useful information about alcohol consumption.</p>
