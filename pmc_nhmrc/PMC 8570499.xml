                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Implementing evidence into clinical practice is a key focus of healthcare improvements to reduce unwarranted variation. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and knowledge brokering have emerged as potential strategies to achieve evidence implementation by influencing resource allocation decisions. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of these two research implementation strategies to facilitate evidence-informed healthcare management decisions for the provision of inpatient weekend allied health services.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>This multicentre, single-blinded (data collection and analysis), three-group parallel cluster randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation was conducted in Australian and New Zealand hospitals between February 2018 and January 2020. Clustering and randomisation took place at the organisation level where weekend allied health staffing decisions were made (e.g., network of hospitals or single hospital). Hospital wards were nested within these decision-making structures. Three conditions were compared over a 12-month period: (1) usual practice waitlist control; (2) dissemination of written evidence-based practice recommendations; and (3) access to a webinar-based knowledge broker in addition to the recommendations. The primary outcome was the alignment of weekend allied health provision with practice recommendations at the cluster and ward levels, addressing the adoption, penetration, and fidelity to the recommendations. The secondary outcome was mean hospital length of stay at the ward level. Outcomes were collected at baseline and 12 months later. A total of 45 clusters (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 833 wards) were randomised to either control (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 15), recommendation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 16), or knowledge broker (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14) conditions. Four (9%) did not provide follow-up data, and no adverse events were recorded. No significant effect was found with either implementation strategy for the primary outcome at the cluster level (recommendation versus control β 18.11 [95% CI −8,721.81 to 8,758.02] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.997; knowledge broker versus control β 1.24 [95% CI −6,992.60 to 6,995.07] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 1.000; recommendation versus knowledge broker β −9.12 [95% CI −3,878.39 to 3,860.16] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.996) or ward level (recommendation versus control β 0.01 [95% CI 0.74 to 0.75] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.983; knowledge broker versus control β −0.12 [95% CI −0.54 to 0.30] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.581; recommendation versus knowledge broker β −0.19 [−1.04 to 0.65] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.651). There was no significant effect between strategies for the secondary outcome at ward level (recommendation versus control β 2.19 [95% CI −1.36 to 5.74] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.219; knowledge broker versus control β −0.55 [95% CI −1.16 to 0.06] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.075; recommendation versus knowledge broker β −3.75 [95% CI −8.33 to 0.82] <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.102). None of the control or knowledge broker clusters transitioned to partial or full alignment with the recommendations. Three (20%) of the clusters who only received the written recommendations transitioned from nonalignment to partial alignment. Limitations include underpowering at the cluster level sample due to the grouping of multiple geographically distinct hospitals to avoid contamination.</p>

                  <p>Owing to a lack of power at the cluster level, this trial was unable to identify a difference between the knowledge broker strategy and dissemination of recommendations compared with usual practice for the promotion of evidence-informed resource allocation to inpatient weekend allied health services. Future research is needed to determine the interactions between different implementation strategies and healthcare contexts when translating evidence into healthcare practice.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Healthcare systems worldwide continue to grapple with unwarranted variation in quality and safety. On average, an estimated 60% of care is delivered according to recommended guidelines [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while up to 30% is considered low-value care [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Underuse of effective treatments and overuse of those with questionable benefit are arguably responsible for substantial inefficiency and lost opportunity to improve patient outcomes, particularly when considering improvements that could be realised by reallocating resources to high-value care.</p>
              <p>The evidence-to-practice gap often manifests through decisions and negotiations within and across multiple levels of the health system [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These phenomena create a complex ecosystem, where the delivery of care can be dependent upon policy and managerial decisions regarding the organisation of resources. One highly topical area of healthcare policy and management decision-making is the provision of weekend allied health services to inpatient wards [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Internationally, there is substantial variation in access to allied health professionals within hospitals (e.g., physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists dietitians, social workers, and podiatrists) [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This variability is typified by service provision during weekends, where some hospitals extend limited provision of allied health services [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that additional weekend allied health services in subacute rehabilitation units can reduce hospital length of stay by over two days and is a cost-effective approach to improve function and health-related quality of life [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the benefits were less clear for acute general medical and surgical wards. Despite this evidence, subacute rehabilitation units often provide less allied health during weekends, compared to acute general medical and surgical wards, both in absolute and relative terms [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Accessing and applying research evidence to guide resource allocation decisions can be difficult for healthcare managers [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate strategies that promote evidence-informed decision-making to ensure that the benefits of research on weekend allied health service models can be translated to improved health outcomes. Guidelines and recommendations are widely used to disseminate concise instructions regarding patient care. Recommendations have been found to increase awareness of key messages, change attitudes and knowledge [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and impact practice in some circumstances [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, they do not always lead to meaningful changes in behaviour [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Given the feasibility and low cost involved, dissemination of evidence-based practice recommendations may be an efficient way to change practice under certain conditions, even if it is less effective than more interactive alternatives. A more interactive, and resource-intensive, approach is the use of knowledge brokering to support dissemination and implementation of recommendations into evidence-informed decision-making [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Knowledge brokers are intermediary agents who build relationships between decision-makers and researchers, by sharing expert knowledge and establishing communication channels [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Much of this work occurs informally [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Yet, these roles are increasingly being formalised and institutionalised [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], despite limited evidence to support their effectiveness [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The substantial cost and resources required to deliver formalised knowledge broker roles [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] require evidence of both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness to justify investment. This is because the health system is characterised by finite funding, which must be allocated to competing needs: providing funds for activities with unknown levels of effectiveness such as knowledge brokering is difficult to justify, as those same funds can no longer be used for alternative activities that are known to effectively improve health outcomes elsewhere in the health system.</p>
              <p>The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of knowledge brokering and dissemination of evidence-based practice recommendations for weekend allied health resource allocation decisions by hospital managers.</p>

                <title>Context</title>
                <p>Allied health professionals routinely deliver inpatient services Monday to Friday for hospitals in high-income countries. In certain parts of the world, these services are also extended during Saturday and Sunday, with Saturday physiotherapy services being the most provided [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In Australia, approximately 60% of acute hospital wards and 30% of subacute wards provide physiotherapy during weekends [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which contrasts with Level-I evidence indicating that the benefits are clearer in subacute rehabilitation units [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A recent study by Haines and colleagues demonstrated that weekend allied health services could be removed from acute general medical and surgical wards without impacting health or service delivery outcomes and that redesign and reinstatement of these services also did not change these outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>In this multicentre study, we conducted a blinded (data collection and analysis) three-group, parallel cluster randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation to compare two alternate research implementation strategies with a control. Clustering occurred at the organisation level where weekend allied health staffing decisions were made within each healthcare organisation to avoid the potential risk of contamination between units of randomisation (e.g., network of hospitals or single hospital). Hospital wards were nested within these decision-making structures. For example, organisations made up of geographically distinct hospitals that made independent decisions in relation to allied health staffing were randomised as separate clusters; those making decisions across hospitals within the organisation were randomised as a single cluster. The diversity in decision-making structures across Australian and New Zealand hospitals constrained the ability to prespecify the number of potentially eligible hospitals/wards to be included within each cluster. Randomisation was stratified based on self-reported geographical classification, as either metropolitan or rural (including regional and remote). This study design is considered the most suitable to address questions of effectiveness, avoid potential contamination across study conditions, and capture outcomes at the system levels where changes were expected to occur.</p>
                <p>During the conduct of this study, there was one randomisation error and one modification to the statistical methods described in our study protocol. The randomisation error occurred when one cluster was randomised to the recommendation group but mistakenly did not receive it because of human error. Data were still collected from this cluster and analysed according to the group to which they were assigned. Modifications to the analysis are outlined in the statistical methods section.

                <p>Briefly, three study conditions were delivered at the cluster level: (1) usual practice wait list control; (2) dissemination of written evidence-based practice recommendations; and (3) access to a webinar-based knowledge broker in addition to the recommendations. The waitlist control group experienced usual practice conditions according to their local setting. Upon study completion, they received the evidence-based recommendations for weekend allied health provision. Participants in the recommendation group were provided with an evidence-based weekend allied health practice recommendation (detailed and summarised) document via email. This document contained specific recommendations for the proportion of total allied health services that should be delivered during weekends. The document was constructed with an outline of key messages, executive summary, and presentation of the full research methods and findings [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The knowledge broker group was provided the same recommendation document and additional access to a knowledge broker who facilitated the transfer of relevant information to promote evidence-informed decision-making. The knowledge broker offered support via interactive online webinar, telephone, or email, in one-on-one and group settings. Prompting questions by the knowledge broker were informed by the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation, and behaviour) behaviour change model [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This support included individual needs assessments and developing a 12-month plan to address the recommendations. These supports followed an iterative process depending on participant needs, based on factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies from a recent systematic review [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The dosage and duration of the interventions were based on a similar study evaluating a knowledge broker role [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which aligned with our hypothesis that a 12-month intervention duration would prove sufficient time for hospital managers to develop and implement a business case for change.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome of interest was whether weekend allied health service provision at both the cluster and ward level aligned with the recommendations at 12-month follow-up. This outcome addressed the adoption of evidence-based practice recommendation, penetration among eligible hospital wards, and fidelity to the recommendation. Alignment with the recommendations was determined according to the number of allied health service events occurring during weekends, as a proportion of the total allied health service events for the cluster or ward, over a one-month period. A ratio of allied health full-time equivalent staffing was used, where service event data were not available (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 3 clusters). Allied health service event data were collected at the time of randomisation for the preceding calendar month and the same calendar month, 12 months later. For cluster-level analysis, each cluster received a single classification as either (1) fully aligned with the recommendations for both acute wards and subacute units; (2) partially aligned with the recommendations (if acute wards are aligned but subacute units are not aligned, or vice versa); or (3) not aligned with policy recommendations. For the ward-level analysis, each acute ward or subacute unit received a single classification as either (1) fully aligned with the recommendations; or (2) not aligned with policy recommendations.</p>
                <p>The secondary outcome was the mean hospital length of stay at each ward for the calendar month 12 months after study entry. We also collected equivalent data for each ward from the same calendar month 12 months earlier. Hospital length of stay was extracted from administrative data sources [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Detailed process and economic outcomes described in our protocol are planned for other publications.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Study investigators consulted with each healthcare organisation to determine their decision-making structure for allied health staffing to reduce the risk of contamination between study groups. Healthcare organisations that made allied health staffing decisions across multiple hospitals were treated as a single unit of recruitment and randomisation, where hospitals with independent decision-making processes within a broader healthcare organisation were treated as separate units. Hospital wards were nested within clusters and randomised using a random number sequence, generated by a single investigator (TPH) using an online software application [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] with permuted blocks within randomisation strata of sizes of 3, 6, or 9. Investigators conducting recruitment, data collection, and analysis (MS and MJ) were blinded, as per procedures outlined in the published protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>Initially, the use of the nonparametric rank-based classical hypothesis test was planned to compare data for the primary outcome. However, changes were made to account for the observation that several clusters and wards were already aligned with the evidence-based recommendations. We changed our analysis approach to an ordered logit regression at the cluster level and logistic regression analysis at the ward level, so we could statistically adjust for the baseline status of each unit of analysis when comparing 12-month follow-up alignment with the recommendations between groups. These ANCOVA style analyses are aligned with recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] for how baseline values can be appropriately incorporated into an interventional analysis framework. We used robust variance estimates to account for dependency of clustering across wards that had the same decision-makers, such that this analysis was still analysing data relative to the level of randomisation. The mean hospital length of stay was compared between groups in a ward-level analysis. Linear regression using baseline mean hospital length of stay as a covariate and robust variance estimates at the level of the decision maker was conducted.</p>
                <p>Analysis of cluster-level and ward-level data was undertaken according to the group to which they were assigned by an analyst (MS) blinded to group allocation, using three mock codes representing different sequence allocation patterns. Multiple imputation using chained equations was performed to impute 50 datasets for missing values in both baseline and follow-up alignment with the recommendations. Geographical classification was used as the independent variable when imputing missing data at the cluster level; geographical classification and ward classification were used at the ward level. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted: The first was a complete case analysis for comparison with the analysis of imputed data, and the second was a multivariable analysis to adjust for other potential baseline confounders (cluster level: geography and full-time research staffing; ward level: geography and ward type). All analyses were adjusted for the number of weekday days and weekend days within the month to ensure that calendar years changes in the proportion of day types did not impact the results. Analyses were undertaken using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Sample size estimates are reported in our study protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
                <p>We planned two levels of analysis, one to be conducted at the cluster level (one unit of data per cluster) and the other to be conducted at the ward level (nested within cluster). The study sample size was determined based on the most conservative unit of assessment for our primary outcome at the cluster level (organisation-level where weekend allied health staffing decisions were made), as an adequate sample size at the cluster level would also prove sufficient at the ward level. Further power analysis at the ward level was not conducted because there was no reasonable way to estimate the likely intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for this healthcare context and our main sample size constraints pertained to practicality of recruitment at the cluster level. A sample size of 25 clusters per group was estimated to provide greater than 80% power, assuming that 50% of clusters in either intervention group and 10% in the control group completely aligned with the policy recommendations. The diversity in decision-making structures across Australian and New Zealand hospitals constrained our ability to prespecify the number of hospitals/wards within each cluster and recruit sufficient clusters per group, as often allied health staffing decisions were made across hospitals/wards within organisations resulting in fewer potential units of randomisation. Study data used in these analyses are provided (<xref rid="pmed.1003833.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1003833.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Data).</p>

              <p>The summative raw data for the primary and secondary outcomes are presented in Tables <xref rid="pmed.1003833.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1003833.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Proportion of total allied health service events provided on weekends is presented for each group, along with the corresponding number and percentage of clusters or wards aligned with the recommendations. None of the clusters in the control or knowledge broker groups transitioned from “not aligned” at baseline to “partial” or “full alignment” at 12-month follow-up. Three clusters (21%) that did not align to the practice recommendations, from the written recommendation document only group, transitioned to partial alignment within the study period. The flow of cluster alignment from baseline to follow-up, by implementation strategy group, is presented in Figs <xref rid="pmed.1003833.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The most common reasons for missing follow-up data across all three groups were (1) that a different contact person was used (due to staff turnover) who did not know how to extract all the required data; and (2) the contact person did not have time to extract all the required data.</p>

                <p>The knowledge broker strategy dose varied from that specified in the protocol across sites, due to differing levels of participant engagement. There were 17 interactive online knowledge broker support webinars (duration one to two hours) conducted in total to facilitate the transfer of relevant information to promote evidence-informed decision-making. Healthcare decision maker participation was higher in the initial (range 6 to 18) compared to follow-up (range 2 to 8) webinars. Typically, the first webinars were attended by representatives from each allied health profession; however, the second webinar was predominantly attended by decision-makers from the physiotherapy and occupational therapy professions because the evidence and recommendations mostly pertained to these roles. Only two clusters (14%) participated in more than two webinars with the knowledge broker. A desire to make an internal decision regarding weekend allied health service provision was the most common reason for nonparticipation. Two clusters (14%) did not engage with the knowledge broker without providing a reason. Further detail regarding the knowledge broker webinar support sessions is published elsewhere [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Other process, economic, and qualitative outcomes specified in our protocol are planned to be reported in other publications.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study was unable to identify differences between the knowledge broker and dissemination of written evidence-based practice recommendation strategies employed for hospital managers to improve the alignment of weekend allied health services with current evidence. These findings were possibly driven by the high rate of baseline alignment with the recommendations in the knowledge broker group and inadequate statistical power at the cluster-level analysis, despite including 132 hospitals and 833 wards. All 15 clusters assigned to the control group continued providing weekend allied health that was not aligned with the recommendations. Three clusters (21%) from the dissemination of written recommendations only group transitioned from nonalignment at baseline to partial alignment 12 months later. None of the clusters who received the knowledge broker in addition to the recommendations transitioned to partial or full alignment with the recommendations. The reduction in hospital length of stay for the knowledge broker group compared to the control indicates that there may have been an effect but the precise mechanism is unclear without an observed change in recommendation alignment.</p>
              <p>Our study results are concordant with the only other three-arm trial published on the dissemination of recommendations and knowledge brokering for implementing evidence into healthcare policies and programs [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This earlier research was also unable to demonstrate a positive effect of their knowledge broker implementation strategy; however, the authors reported that impacts may have been more pronounced for health departments with low baseline organisational research culture. Achieving our desired outcomes at only a few organisations aligns with this, and other previous research indicating the effect of research implementation strategies may be contextually specific to organisational characteristics, such as strategic priority, leadership, and readiness [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The knowledge broker group in our study was characterised by higher baseline rates of recommendation alignment, despite pilot work conducted prior to study commencement indicating that most healthcare organisations were unlikely to be aligned with the evidence-based practice recommendations. While our analysis adjusted for baseline alignment, it is possible that a ceiling effect was reached in this group or other potentially confounding variables may have influenced differences in follow-up recommendation alignment. Formal assessment of evidence alignment and other potential confounders prior to study commencement was considered impractical within this study due to the data collection burden for time-limited hospital managers. Although, future research may benefit from these baseline assessments if information can be captured via routinely collected data for administrative or other purposes.</p>
              <p>The decision to use an externally based, centralised knowledge broker to deliver support across multiple hospitals via interactive online webinar may have been an important factor influencing the strategy’s impact. Our findings align with a similar cluster randomised controlled trial conducted by Minian and colleagues, which compared generic emails with a remote knowledge broker to integrate mood management into a smoking cessation program [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In their study, the more intense and personalised remote knowledge broker strategy was no more effective at enabling healthcare professionals to provide their patients with mood management resources. The “more is better” theory, suggesting that a higher implementation strategy dosage through frequency of interactions or longer duration leads to greater success, is difficult to reconcile with this emerging empirical evidence. Hospital managers and healthcare professionals are time and resource constrained, facing multiple competing priorities that limit their ability to engage in more active strategies to facilitate evidence implementation [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The limited frequency and duration of the knowledge broker interactions may have impeded observed effectiveness of the strategy. However, it is unlikely that providing additional opportunities for engagement or a longer duration (e.g., 24 months) would have changed the dosage received, given the limited voluntary hospital manager engagement throughout the 12-month period and the desire to make an internal decision being the most common reason for limited engagement.</p>
              <p>Most clusters only attended one or two group-based knowledge broker support sessions, which were delivered online rather than face-to-face. The limited dosage and mode of delivery may have constrained the ability to build relationships with the hospital managers. Knowledge broker roles are inherently relationship based [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], whose theory of change is premised on interpersonal contact [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], development of rapport [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and building linkages and exchange between research producers and end users [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These social influence mechanisms of change [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] imply that the effectiveness of a knowledge broker may be largely individual dependent [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and could be enhanced by embedded brokerage roles within organisations. For example, interactions between different hospital managers and knowledge brokers can result in varying levels of “relationship capital,” which is instrumental to fostering use of knowledge [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Less formal roles that are internal to organisations, such as opinion leaders or clinical champions, could instead be considered to leverage preexisting, peer-to-peer relationships and channels of persuasion [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It is important for informal brokers to consider group affiliation with the hospital managers, through occupation and professional legitimacy, to ensure that brokerage is not considered as “outsider expertise” [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These localised models of knowledge brokering, such as the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs), may provide a more situationally relevant, flexible, and collaborative approach to implement research into practice [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], albeit at a higher cost of investment.</p>
              <p>The small number of clusters in this study was primarily driven by the need to cluster multiple geographically distinct hospitals to avoid contamination. During protocol design and sample size calculation, it was not possible to anticipate how many wards would be included in each cluster prior to recruitment, as we first needed to ascertain the decision-making structure for each healthcare organisation to in order to understand how many wards were nested within each decision-making structure (e.g., single hospital or network of hospitals). We acknowledge that our efforts to understand and cluster according to these decision-making structures prevented prespecification of cluster size. This design element was imperative to avoid the potential risk of contamination between units of randomisation. Recruitment challenges and difficulty ensuring adequate statistical power in analyses have been reported in other studies seeking to implement evidence into health system policy changes [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], particularly for pragmatic “real-world” projects at the level of organisations rather than individuals [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Considering the challenges experienced in this study and others, some have questioned the appropriateness of empirical designs for evaluating the effectiveness of implementation strategies, such as knowledge brokering [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Instead, more exploratory approaches oriented towards improving the understanding of how, why, when, and in what circumstances these strategies address more subjective, intermediate outcomes (e.g., capability for evidence engagement) have been advocated. These types of pluralistic, discursive, and iterative methods hold considerable value for understanding the processes by which the institutionalisation of evidence-based practice can occur. However, the decision to delegate and allocate healthcare resources to specific individual knowledge brokers requires consideration of its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, in relation to competing priorities that are known to effectively improve health outcomes elsewhere in the health system. We contend that there are design-based solutions for overcoming the challenges in empirically studying the effectiveness of implementation strategies. For example, the use of counterbalanced implementation study designs has been proposed as a solution to these challenges, requiring smaller sample sizes through the concurrent investigation of multiple implementation strategies across different health context areas [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p>
              <p>Weekend allied health service provision presented a uniquely challenging contextual area to implement evidence into practice. Healthcare professionals tend to incorporate local “tacit” or “codified” knowledge [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] into resource allocation decisions [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], particularly when presented with recommendations to reduce weekend allied health in acute general medical and surgical wards where the evidence base was considered less clear [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These findings align with previous research reporting that disinvestment from weekend services in these wards has been perceived as a threat to professional identity [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Conversely, recommendation to increase weekend services in subacute rehabilitation units was met with enthusiasm where this aligned with previously held attitudes, beliefs, and values [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Future research on these knowledge translation strategies is therefore needed across multiple contextual areas to determine the interaction effect between these strategies and context areas [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Further, an updated knowledge broker strategy with greater internal organisational relationships, which incorporates a component of cognitive debiasing to assist managers and policy makers when confronted with evidence that conflicts with current service delivery models, might reduce potential barriers to change and facilitate active implementation of evidence into practice [<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003833.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Owing to a lack of power at the cluster level, this trial was unable to determine whether the use of a webinar-based knowledge broker was more effective than dissemination of recommendations or usual practice for promoting evidence-informed healthcare management decisions for inpatient weekend allied health services. The implication of this research is that more intense and interactive strategies for implementing evidence into practice do not always enable changes in resource allocation. Future research is needed across multiple contextual areas of healthcare recommendations to understand the context dependency of implementation strategy success, using counterbalanced implementation study deigns.</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The evaluation of knowledge brokering is important to contribute to the knowledge translation literature. As the authors point out there have been relatively few empirical studies conducted to date evaluating the impact of knowledge brokering on the use of evidence-informed practices and/or recommendations. I enjoyed reading this article and believe, with revisions, it will be an important contribution to the literature. However, I have a few concerns that I feel are important to be addressed prior to publication. </p>
              <p>Major Concerns:</p>
              <p>1) greater justification for the use of a cluster randomized controlled trial given previous suggestions in the literature to avoid the use of such a design to evaluate knowledge brokering.</p>
              <p>2) More detail needs to be provided about the knowledge brokering intervention as this is very sparse.</p>
              <p>3) However, my understanding from what is written about the knowledge brokering intervention is that in entailed interactive webinars. While this is certainly one activity that knowledge brokers engage in, if this was the only activity conducted during this study, I would not classify this as knowledge brokering. As the authors point out in the discussion, knowledge brokering involves building relationships with end users and considerable interaction. It does not appear from the description provided that these activities occurred, which might suggest that what was actually evaluated in this study was webinars as a knowledge translation strategy delivered by a knowledge broker. </p>
              <p>4) Also, previous research has suggested that knowledge brokering likely needs to be implemented for more than 12 months to be effective, so perhaps some more justification can be provided for why a 12 month intervention was implemented in this study. </p>
              <p>5) A significant challenge for this study is the extent to which it is under powered to detect even a large difference. I have two issues here. The sample size calculation is based on a very large effect (50% alignment with the allied health allocation recommendation). Justification from previous knowledge brokering studies for such a large effect should be provided. However, I am not certain that there is evidence to suggest that knowledge brokering evaluations in the past has found such large effects, in which case, a much more conservative effect size should have been used in the sample size calculation. The challenge this creates is that the required sample size would be much larger than it already is, which makes this study even more under-powered.</p>
              <p>6) With the study being so significantly under-powered, the conclusion is worded much too strongly, that knowledge brokering is no more effective than dissemination of recommendations or standard practice. Given the lack of power to detect a difference, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that there was insufficient power to observe statistically significant differences between groups.</p>
              <p>7) The ceiling effect in this study requires more attention in the discussion. While a regression analysis was conducted to take into account differences at baseline with half of the knowledge brokering group already being in alignment with the recommendations, this may not adequately adjust for these baseline differences. It is also worth noting that the knowledge brokering group had more highly educated participants than the other two groups, and could this explain the baseline difference in the primary outcome? </p>
              <p>8) I believe a much more developed discussion about the lessons learned about what went wrong in this trial would be extremely helpful in helping others fall in to the same challenges in evaluating knowledge brokering. This includes: appropriate designs for evaluation, a more fulsome knowledge brokering intervention implemented for a longer period of time, ensuring it is feasible to be adequately powered to detect statistically significant differences, and ensuring the outcome is not present prior to intervention. A comprehensive discussion of these issues, drawing from what is currently known in the literature, with suggestions on how to avoid these pitfalls, will provide an important contribution to the literature. </p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>1) In the abstract it is stated the study occurred between Feb 2018 and Jan 2020, but in the Results section of the paper, it is stated data collection occurred until April 2020. </p>
              <p>2) Provide justification for why at the ward level, partial alignment with the recommendations was not included as an option for measuring the outcome.</p>
              <p>3) It is stated in the methods that an intention to treat analysis was conducted. However, 4 organizations either did not provide any data or follow-up data and therefore were not included in the analysis. This is not consistent with intention to treat analysis. For an intention to treat analysis to have been conducted, those organizations that did not provide data should have still been analyzed in the group to which they were allocated. </p>
              <p>4) I may have missed it but I did not see statements as to there being statistically significant differences between groups at baseline. From the data provided it appears as though there could be. </p>
              <p>5) there is a formatting issue with Ref #30 </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting cluster randomised controlled trial on the effectiveness of knowledge brokering and recommendation dissemination on resource allocation decisions. However, the trial was poorly designed and conducted with quite a few major issues needing attention.</p>
              <p>1) Cluster design. Throughout the paper, there is no detailed description of the cluster RCT design especially on cluster size. Also It's very confusing as to what was ultimately randomised? decision makers or wards?</p>
              <p>2) Sample size calculation. On page 10 and 11, it said "a sample size of 25 clusters per group..." but in the results it said 15 clusters per group. Also, cluster size or ICC was never mentioned. And, why effect size is on cluster level rather than paticipants level? In short, the sample size calculation was very confusing and not informative therefore not adequate at all.</p>
              <p>3) Primary outcome. It says on page 9 "The primary outcome of interest was whether weekend allied health service provision at both the cluster- and ward-level aligned with the recommendations at 12-months follow up". However, wards were not in the sample size calculation so not powered therefore should not be used as a primary outcome.</p>
              <p>4) Intention to treat. It's claimed on page 10 "Analysis was undertaken according to intention-to-treat principles...". However, as shown in Figure 1 and table 1, the randomisation was disrupted at cluster level with error and empty clusters and also at healthcare decision maker level as shown in table 1 with huge imbalance. Basically, the trial analysis was not intention to treat at all, neither at cluster level nor paticipant level. The imbalance at both levels mean the trial was poor conducted and lost the purpose of effective randomisation. It basically becomes an observational study.</p>
              <p>5) Statistical analysis. As the trial was not balanced at both levels, the simple summary statistics as shown in table 1-4 becomes inadequate and potentially misleading. Multivariable analysis adjusted for all confounders is essentially needed however it's not done or seen at all in results section although vaguely mentioned in the stats methods section. All these methodological inadequacies can lead to unreliable and unbelievable results and conclusions.</p>
              <p>6) Randomisation. On page 10, not clear what was randomised? clusters or healthcare managers?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: I wish to thank the editor for their invitation to review the manuscript, titled "Effectiveness of knowledge brokering and recommendation dissemination on resource allocation decisions: cluster randomised controlled trial." The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of two research implementation strategies to facilitate evidence-informed healthcare management decisions for the provision of inpatient weekend allied health services. Given that I am not a statistician and I would recommend the editors consider a statistical review prior to publication. I present my concerns in the order they appeared:</p>
              <p>1. The Title: I find it a bit confusing and not specific enough </p>
              <p>2. The abstract: Might want to be specific as to which were the two implementation strategies used. </p>
              <p>3. The background section they might want to describe in more detail what is meant by "the dissemination of of evidence-based practice recommendations " (line 114-115), and the literature behind this strategy. </p>
              <p>4. How can the participants be blinded to receiving the support of a knowledge broker? </p>
              <p>5. How was the COM-B model used? </p>
              <p>6. Discussion: How do their finding relate to what previous researchers have found? </p>
              <p>7. What are the implications to the field? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: This study tried to address an important issue of the impact of evidence dissemination and knowledge brokering on implementation of health system evidence. It is a well designed cluster randomized trial, which is a strength. However there are a few significant shortcomings that affect the validity and usefulness of its conclusions.</p>
              <p>-the interventions seem to be multi component and complex. The evidence-based recommendation states the desired objective but suggested complex activities to managers in order to achieve them. Activities such as development of a business case, identification of local priorities, engagement of diverse stakeholders including allied health professionals, nurses, and even patients in the process, and development of communication and negotiation channels with staff. It seems unlikely that email dissemination of an evidence-based guideline or one or two online webinars by the knowledge broker would be sufficient to change the behavior of hospital managers to engage in these complex and resource-intensive activities. </p>
              <p>-Since the authors did not report any information regarding the adoption and implementation of such activities (e.g how many managers initiated those activities, how many actually implemented them in their routine practice, how many were successful in engaging staff in planning and priority setting, etc), it is difficult to attribute the study findings to the lack of effectiveness or unsuccessful implementation. This is a widespread shortcoming in implementation studies, where the emphasis is on comparative effectiveness rather than investigating the conditions that facilitate or impede utilization and ultimate effectiveness of an implementation strategy. Ideally, a mixed methods study would provide better opportunities to address the contextual and procedural complexities of these interventions. But even as a proper RCT, a more comprehensive assessment of implementation outcomes was needed.</p>
              <p>-ward-level analysis of alignment to the guidelines at study arms (table 4) shows that the number of wards with missing status increased dramatically at follow up in knowledge broker and dissemination arms. This along with the lack of engagement of sites in knowledge broker meetings implies that there were challenges in preserving the adherence of hospital mangers to the interventions. More clarification is needed regarding the potential reasons for this lack of adherence and the increase in non-response in intervention arms.</p>

              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have comprehensively addressed all of my suggestions. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Many thanks authors for their great effort to improve the manuscript. I can appreciate the challenges in this implementation trial that investigators have faced and the fact that investigators tried their best to deal with the situations, however, I am still not convinced/statisfied with the response and revision. Remaing issues:</p>
              <p>1) This is not an "intention to treat" analysis. There are 3 clusters without 12-month follow up (primary) so not in the main analysis, as shown in Figure 1. Also multiple imputation for missing data is not ITT analysis. So far, it was effectively performed with a complete case analysis plus sensitivity analysis for missing values (imputation).</p>
              <p>2) Design issue. Cluster RCT without pre-specified or uncertain cluster size? Sample size only for cluster level but not for ward level? Primary outcome for both cluster (powered) and ward (not powered)? All these deviate from the definition of a cluster RCT. Perhaps this is the pragmatic nature of implementation trial but how to address the methodological issues and potential biases which could impact on the results?</p>
              <p>3) Statistical analysis. Again, the trial was not balanced at both levels, the simple summary statistics becomes inadequate and potentially misleading. Multivariable analysis comprehensively adjusted for all confounders is essentially needed. Otherwise, the results may be subject to scrutiny due to design, sample size and trial conduct issues. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors have addressed all the comments in a satisfactory manner.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: The authors tried to address most of the comments by reviewers. The revised manuscript is better organized and is more informative.</p>
              <p>My main remaining concern, which is now more prominent since the term 'implementation' was added to the title, is lack of a guiding framework and evaluation metrics related to the implementation. Alignment of practice with the guidelines does not capture the complexities of the implementation. It seems that some data have already been collected that should be added to the Results. </p>
              <p>-For example webinar attendance rates at ward and organization levels may address the notion of 'adoption' of the intervention by managers. Furthermore, the authors can include ward-level attendance data in the regression analyses to assess its impact on study outcomes.</p>
              <p>-Also, given the large non-response, it is important to provide some contextual information about the characteristics of non-respondents, in comparison to the participating organizations. This comparison may reflect the notion of 'reach' (who was missed?), using RE-AIM terminology.</p>
              <p>-Providing some temporal participation and adoption statistics (how did the participation differ during the first few months vs later dates), if available, would address the notion of sustainability ('maintenance' in RE-AIM).</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Sarkies,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Effectiveness of knowledge brokering and recommendation dissemination for influencing healthcare resource allocation decisions: A cluster randomised controlled implementation trial" (PMEDICINE-D-21-01199R3) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with my colleagues and the academic editor and it was also seen again by two reviewers. I am pleased to say that provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>

              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols.

              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>Thank you for responding to editorial requests. Before we proceed, please address the following comments:</p>
              <p>1) Please highlight in the conclusion (both abstract and main text), that you did not observe a difference imparted by the implementation strategies, owing to lack of power. For example, you could state “owing to lack of power, our study was unable to find whether…”</p>
              <p>2) In the author summary, please revise line 110... should this be “are” instead of “are represent”?</p>
              <p>3) In the abstract, last sentence of “Methods and Findings” please clearly highlight the limitations of the study. The statement, “Limitations of this study include…” can be useful.</p>
              <p>4) References #55, #57: please include access dates for the weblinks, e.g., Accessed July 15, 2021. </p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have addressed all my concerns professionally. I am satisfied with the response and revision. No further issues needing attention. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: I'd like to thank the authors for their efforts to address the comments.</p>
              <p>I think that the researchers could use more suitable implementation theoretical frameworks to guide the design of the study, as well as more relevant and sensitive implementation outcomes to capture the impact of individual, team-level, and organizational factors that could determine the success/failure of the intervention. Despite this, I do not object the publication of this study, given its rigorous design and potentially important implications for further research on knowledge broker interventions. </p>
              <p>However, I re-emphasize that, it should be clearly stated in the study limitations that the observed lack of evidence to support knowledge broker intervention could simply be due the fact that the intervention was not successfully implemented (for which insufficient evidence was provided). I recommend that the authors suggest potential solutions for more theoretically-informed assessment of the implementation of KB interventions.</p>
