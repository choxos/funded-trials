                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>New international clinical practice guidelines exist for identifying infants at high risk of cerebral palsy (CP) earlier: between 12 to 24 weeks corrected age, significantly earlier than previous diagnosis windows in Australia at 19 months. The earlier detection of infants at high risk of CP creates an opportunity for earlier intervention. The quality of the parent-infant relationship impacts various child outcomes, and is leveraged in other forms of intervention. This paper presents the protocol of a randomised controlled trial of an online parent support programme, Early Parenting Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Early PACT) for families of infants identified as at high risk of CP. We predict that participating in the Early PACT programme will be associated with improvements in the parent-infant relationship, in parent mental health and well-being as well as infant behaviour and quality of life.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study aims to recruit 60 parents of infants (0 to 2 years old corrected age) diagnosed with CP or identified as at high risk of having CP. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: Early PACT or waitlist control (1:1). Early PACT is an online parent support programme grounded in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). It is delivered as a course on an open source course management system called edX. Early PACT is designed to support parental adjustment and parent-infant relationship around the time of early diagnosis. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, following completion of Early PACT and at 6-month follow-up (retention). The primary outcome will be the quality of parent-child interactions as measured by the Emotional Availability Scale. Standard analysis methods for randomised controlled trial will be used to make comparisons between the two groups (Early PACT and waitlist control). Retention of effects will be examined at 6-month follow-up.</p>

                <p>Diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) in Australia has traditionally commonly occurs in the first 24 months of life.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> New international clinical practice guidelines for identifying infants at high risk of CP aim to shift detection earlier: to 12 to 24 weeks corrected age.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–6</xref> Earlier detection of infants at high risk of CP both creates an opportunity for earlier intervention and raises questions around the effect of early detection and intervention on the developing parent–child relationship. In this changing clinical context, it is important to explore pathways to supporting parental adjustment and the parent–child relationship in this early stage, from the point of diagnosis/identification as high risk.</p>
                <p>Following the diagnosis of a neurodevelopmental disorder such as CP, parents grieve<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and many desire therapeutic support.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The grieving process varies from parent to parent, but there is often a period of intense grief at the beginning with intensified grieving during major life events.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Grief includes not just sadness but also anxiety about the future.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Parents of children with CP are at risk for poorer psychological adjustment compared with mothers of typically developing children<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> including depressive and anxious symptoms,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> parental stress<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and reduced quality of life.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Parents of infants at high risk of CP need to establish a happy and healthy parent–child bond,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but may need support to achieve this.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>

                <title>Parental responsiveness and child development</title>
                <p>The parent–child relationship in the ﬁrst year of life is foundational to child development. Responsive, emotionally available parenting impacts on multiple infant outcomes, including attachment, psychological adjustment, social behaviour and cognitive development including for children with disabilities. Responsive, emotionally available parenting is child-directed, contingent and appropriate to the child’s needs and development. From a child development perspective, responsive parenting enriches the environment of the infant, enabling the stimulation-hungry infant brain to obtain the optimal ‘dose’ of stimulation for neurological development.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>

                <title>Existing interventions are limited for parents of infants identified as high-risk for CP</title>
                <p>A systematic review identified no interventions targeting parental adjustment and well-being designed specifically for parents of infants with CP or identified as at high-risk of CP.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The review identified research of interventions in parents of infants born preterm had a moderate effect for reducing symptoms of trauma and stress immediately after intervention with longer-term reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms. There were no significant differences in efficacy between intervention frameworks across studies. cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) was the most commonly represented approach. The variation in intervention dosage, framework and delivery pose a challenge in identifying effective elements when developing early interventions for parents of high-risk infants. Future randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are required to investigate: a broader neurodevelopmental risk population, outcomes for parents, infants and the parent–infant dyad, to explore trauma in the earlier diagnosis time frame and to provide longer-term follow-up post-intervention.</p>

                <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is part of the CBT family of therapies and aims to enhance psychological ﬂexibility: the ability persevere or alter your behaviour with full awareness of your present-moment experience and context, based on your chosen values.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As such, ACT emphasises the importance of values or intrinsically rewarding patterns of behaviour, present-moment awareness or mindfulness and experiential acceptance or ongoing non-reactive, open and receptive contact with psychological events such as diﬃcult emotions, cognitions and memories.</p>
                <p>ACT has a growing evidence base for a range of conditions and populations,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–23</xref> including parenting.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–27</xref> This has included trials for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities such as acquired brain injury and autistic spectrum disorder.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> In the CP population in particular, the combination of an established parenting intervention with ACT was shown to improve parental adjustment, child behaviour and child quality of life.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref></p>

                <p>As mentioned earlier, the development of Early PACT was undertaken grounded on qualitative research with parents who received an early diagnosis for their infant as high risk for CP, as well as with health professionals who work with families of children with CP (Dickinson, Sheffield, Boyd and Whittingham, <italic>Parent experiences of their infant’s diagnosis of risk of cerebral palsy: a qualitative study</italic>; and Dickinson, Sheffield, Boyd and Whittingham, <italic>Understanding health professionals’ perspectives of the impact of earlier diagnosis of infants at risk of cerebral palsy: a brief report</italic>). No patients were involved in the recruitment to or conduct of this study protocol. Patient self-referral and word of mouth will assist with recruitment for the RCT. In addition, patient feedback will be collected qualitatively via survey and a semi-structured interview as their experiences and opinion will inform the suitability of offering the Early PACT course as an early support option to parents around the time of their infants’ diagnosis. The results of the RCT will be disseminated to study participants via research centre e-newsletters, as well as through peer-reviewed publications and national and international conferences.</p>

                <p>Participants will be recruited through the Queensland Cerebral Palsy and Rehabilitation Research Centre, the early detection networks of the Australasian Cerebral Palsy Clinical Trials Network, Queensland Early Detection and Intervention Network – Cerebral Palsy, Cerebral Palsy Alliance (NSW) and The University of Auckland, New Zealand, and word of mouth. Early PACT uses online delivery and all of the assessments are also performed online so participants can be recruited from across Australia and New Zealand, including regional areas, making this project highly accessible. In hospitals, relevant clinicians will develop recruitment protocols that introduce the study details to eligible families and refer interested families to the study. In other settings, study flyer and promotional letters with contact details of the researchers will be disseminated to eligible participants. A referral form has been developed in either hard copy or online format for ease and convenience to assist clinicians in identifying and referring potentially eligible families. Parents can also self-refer via this form. The form requests contact details for the family so the Early PACT study coordinator can contact them and assess study eligibility further, explain the study in detail to parents and obtain consent to participate. The online form also has a link to the Early PACT study flyer, so clinicians only require one link for information about the study when they are meeting with families in their usual clinics. Enrolment for Early PACT commenced in March 2019.</p>

Accounting for an 80% retention rate of participants we plan to recruit 60 participants. This is feasible as Early PACT intervention and assessments are delivered online, so, recruitment can include parents throughout Australia and New Zealand. Families of infants identiﬁed as ‘high risk of CP’ will be readily recruited using the early detections networks of the Australasian CP Clinical Trials Network.</p>

                <p>Early PACT is a parenting course adapted from PACT, a parenting intervention previously designed for families of children (2 to 10 years of age) with CP.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Both Early PACT and PACT are grounded in the ACT approach,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> with the aim of enhancing the parent–infant relationship and parental emotional responsiveness. The Early PACT course was created in the edX platform and has been named Early PARENT101. It consists of video presentations, virtual text information, interactive activities, reflections and journal activities, as well guided experiential exercises to promote mindfulness and self-compassion. Parents will also be able to participate in a moderated discussion board with other parent participants. Early PARENT101 comprises of three modules plus a review session. Each module consists of approximately 2 to 3 hours of content and exercises, and course design allows parents ﬂexibility to move through it at their own pace. Each module is scheduled to be completed in a fortnight. After the third module, there is a 4-week break to allow for practice of the materials from the course. The whole course will take a total of 10 weeks to complete. The course content will explore parents’ values, thoughts and feelings, mindfulness techniques, ways to meet their infant’s needs and exercises to develop compassion. Parents will be able to watch video presentations and engage in exercises to reflect on what they have learnt and how they might practice the strategies with their own child.</p>
                <p>To maximise participant retention and support engagement in the Early PARENT101 course, email or text message reminders will be sent to participants to complete the online assessments and approximately five phone or Zoom consultations will be conducted by study personnel with each participant throughout completion of the course. These consultations aim to facilitate and support engagement in the course, as well as to assist with the individuasation and adaptation of the strateiges from Early PARENT101 to participants’ everyday life.</p>

                  <title>What do parents think of Early PACT?</title>
                  <p>Satisfaction with Early PACT content and format will be measured using a questionnaire specifically developed for this study. The questionnaire will ask participating parents to rate various aspects of Early PACT on 10-point scale as well as give qualitative feedback. A secondary goal of this study is to determine if Early PACT would be suitable for clinicians to offer parents at the time a diagnosis or a high risk of CP is communicated to parents. A blinded independent interviewer, will therefore collect some qualitative information by conducting a semi-structured phone interviews with parents individually post-intervention to gain an understanding parents’ experience around the disclosure of diagnosis, their experience of the Early PACT course and their opinion on whether or not it would be a suitable support option offered to parents around the time of diagnosis.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Analyses will follow standard principles for RCTs using two-group comparisons on all participants on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary comparison immediately post-intervention (T2) based on EAS will be between treatment groups using analysis of covariance with treatment group (Early PACT/waitlist control) included as the main effect and baseline EAS as the covariate. Effect estimates will be presented as mean difference and 95% CI. Secondary outcome analyses will use similar methods to compare all other outcomes between groups immediately post-intervention (T2). Similar outcome analyses will also be used to compare outcomes for secondary parent (second parent from the same household) between groups. In cases where interval data are not able to be transformed appropriately for regression analyses, non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney U test) will be used for between-treatment comparisons. Possible differential attrition will be assessed by comparing baseline characteristics of drop-outs and continuing participants using t-tests (or Mann-Whitney U test) for continuous variables and χ<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables. Sensitivity analyses of all outcomes will be conducted using multiple imputation techniques, to investigate the effect of non-ignorable missing data during follow-up. A senior biostatistician will provide advice for guiding and assisting with the analysis. Data will be analysed using SPSS.</p>

The videos will be saved on the secure UQ server immediately after the recording session is complete. Video file names will be in de-identified but re-identifiable form. Any data published will be completely de-identified so as not to reveal the identity of any participant. Signed consent forms will be scanned and saved as digital files and research data including video footage will be stored in electronic form within folders only accessible to study personnel on a University of Queensland secure server.</p>
