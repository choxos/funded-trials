The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH+) programme provides structured nurse support, through telephone outreach, to informal caregivers of older adults following discharge from acute hospital care to home. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of the FECH+ programme on caregivers’ health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after care recipients’ hospital discharge.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A multisite, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with blinded baseline and outcome assessment and intention-to-treat analysis, adhering to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines will be conducted. Participants (N=925 dyads) comprising informal home caregiver (18 years or older) and care recipient (70 years or older) will be recruited when the care recipient is discharged from hospital. Caregivers of patients discharged from wards in three hospitals in Australia (one in Western Australia and two in Queensland) are eligible for inclusion. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The intervention group receive the FECH+ programme, which provides structured support and problem-solving for the caregiver after the care recipient’s discharge, in addition to usual care. The control group receives usual care. The programme is delivered by a registered nurse and comprises six 30–45 min telephone support sessions over 6 months. The primary outcome is caregivers’ HRQOL measured using the Assessment of Quality of Life—eight dimensions. Secondary outcomes include caregiver preparedness, strain and distress and use of healthcare services. Changes in HRQOL between groups will be compared using a mixed regression model that accounts for the correlation between repeated measurements.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In Australia, an estimated 2.65 million people provide informal care, 32% as primary caregivers, of whom over 60% provide support for a spouse or parent.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The proportion of older adults (aged 65 years and over) across the world is expected to double from 12% in 2020 to 22% by 2050<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and in Australia older people expect to continue to live at home, with less than 5% of older people living in Residential Aged Care (RAC) accommodation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Hence informal caregivers are critical in supporting older people to live at home for as long as possible.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>Caregivers, however, report significant personal costs associated with care, including serious financial, social and health problems.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Caregivers repeatedly report lower levels of well-being than the general population. Mental health risks are particularly severe, with caregivers reporting significantly higher levels of loneliness, anxiety, depression and stress than the general population.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> A systematic review found evidence of a negative impact of caregiving on both the mental and physical health of the informal caregiver.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Rising levels of caregiver stress are known to predict premature admission of the care recipient to RAC.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>There is limited evidence that providing supportive programmes, such as face-to-face training, telephone support or online digital programmes, can reduce the adverse consequences of caregiving for older adults.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref> In addition to problems faced by caregivers in providing ongoing care, there is limited evidence about how to effectively support caregivers of older adults when they are discharged from hospital, including what interventions can sustain and improve caregivers’ health and well-being.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> Older adults discharged from hospital are at high risk of functional decline, unplanned hospital readmissions and injurious falls.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> This transition can be particularly problematic for older adults who receive care support and their caregivers. Lack of continuity of care and inadequate communication and discharge plans during this time of transition can increase caregiver burden even further.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> A recent meta-analysis of 23 trials found low quality evidence that informal caregiver interventions provided after hospital discharge may reduce caregiver burden and anxiety in stroke populations. However, they did not change health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anxiety or health resource use.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Over 90% of the included trials were conducted in stroke populations thereby providing limited generalisability. Another systematic review of 21 trials found that telephone interventions providing support for caregivers may slightly reduce anxiety and improve preparedness to care, but did not significantly improve other caregiver outcomes.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> None of the included trials in this review measured changes in HRQOL<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and both reviews recommended further high-quality trials in caregiver populations. Recent qualitative research conducted with caregivers of older adults discharged from hospital indicated that negative impacts of caregiving at this time can stem from feelings of uncertainty exacerbated by gaps in formal support, the strain of balancing caregiving with other life demands and a sense of helplessness.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore further trials that design and evaluate interventions to support caregivers when the older adult they care for is transitioning from hospital to home are required.</p>
              <p>We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) programme, a telephone-based intervention delivered to caregivers when the older adult they cared for was discharged from hospital.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Telephone interventions are part of a suite of expanding telehealth technologies that demonstrate early evidence for providing support for caregivers and families.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A brief intervention of seven Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) 60 min telephone sessions for caregivers of adults with dementia resulted in improved caregiver emotional well-being, decreased exhaustion and reduced depressive symptoms.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Caregivers asked to rate their preferences for telehealth technologies rated telephone as the highest preferred form of technology compared with videoconferencing, Facebook, email and other technologies and telephones have the advantage of being usable for those without access to suitable technology and internet.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A review of telephone and computer-delivered interventions for caregivers of people living with dementia found that these intervention have potential to improve caregiver well-being, in particular those that incorporated various elements of psycho-education, peer support, skills training and health assessments but that further high quality trials were required.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The FECH telephone programme provided support for caregivers in a timely and convenient manner in their own home. It was tailored to address the caregivers’ identified support needs by providing immediate information and resources.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In contrast to previous studies providing caregiver support,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> the FECH programme delivered promising results when piloted with caregivers of older patients following hospital discharge. The programme significantly reduced caregiver strain and distress and increased preparedness to care.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Caregivers also reported high levels of satisfaction with the programme.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> While the programme achieved a moderate effect size that was clinically significant,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> the FECH programme had some limitations. Caregiver support was limited to receiving three telephone contacts over 3 weeks after discharge and did not take an approach that assisted caregivers to develop and implement problem-solving skills. The trial was conducted in a single hospital ward and 141 dyads provided data at all time points. Since it is evident that caring frequently results in a significant negative impact across mental, physical, social and emotional health of caregivers,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> we seek to measure the impact of the intervention by using a HRQOL tool. These tools are patient-reported outcome measures and therefore capture the individuals own perception of their health and well-being in a broad sense including their quality of life.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Therefore we aim to increase the duration and intensity of the programme (FECH+) and conduct a multicentre RCT to evaluate whether the FECH+ programme may improve caregivers’ HRQOL. Secondary aims will assist to explore potential causal mechanisms (such as reduction in caregiver distress and improved caregiver self-efficacy) by which participation in the FECH+ programme in addition to usual discharge care may improve caregiver HRQOL. Since the original FECH programme improved caregiving preparedness, we also seek to examine if the FECH+ programme results in improvements in care, and therefore in care recipients’ levels of independence and symptoms of distress.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Aims and hypotheses</title>
                <p>The primary aims of the trial are to (i) evaluate the efficacy of participation in the FECH+ programme in addition to usual discharge care on HRQOL of caregivers of older adults discharged home from hospital, compared with receiving usual discharge care alone: (ii) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention using the framework of a within-trial, cost-utility analysis. The secondary aims are to evaluate the efficacy of participation in the FECH+ programme in addition to usual discharge care on: (i) caregiver preparedness to care, caregiver self-efficacy and levels of strain and distress; (ii) care recipient outcomes of symptoms of distress and level of independence, compared with usual discharge care alone.</p>
                <p>The primary hypothesis is that caregivers participating in the FECH+ programme in addition to receiving usual hospital discharge care (intervention group) when compared with caregivers receiving usual discharge care alone (control group), will report improved HRQOL. Secondary hypotheses are that the: (1) intervention group will report improved caregiving preparedness, decreased strain and distress and improved caregiver self-efficacy compared with the control group; and (2) care recipients in the intervention group will experience decreased symptom distress and improved independence compared with the control group.</p>
                <p>A separate process evaluation will be conducted to explore how caregiving is impacted by participating in the FECH+ programme and identify aspects of implementation that particularly contribute to effectiveness. A subsequent trial-based economic evaluation will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention using the framework of a within-trial, cost-utility analysis.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants will be enrolled as dyads (caregiver and care recipient). To be eligible for the study caregivers must be: (a) aged 18 years or older; (b) providing unpaid support as a caregiver to a patient (care recipient) aged 70 years or older when this care recipient is discharged home from a ward included in the study; care recipients must be: (c) discharged home from a ward included in the study. Exclusion criteria are that care recipients are discharged to a setting other than home (such as to a nursing home or another hospital) or undertake a hospital in the home programme. Based on a definition of a caregiver used in an Australian study investigating the support of frail older people,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> caregivers are defined as family members or friends providing care and support to older people. The support must be regular (at least weekly) ongoing, home-based and can be physical and/or emotional care. In Australia unpaid care and support is provided by family and friends on a voluntary basis as compared with paid caregivers who provide personal and home care services through aged care organisations.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>The trial will be conducted at three public hospitals in Australia. In Western Australia (WA), the site is Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, a metropolitan tertiary hospital with approximately 600 beds. In Queensland (QLD), the two hospitals are Robina Hospital (approximately 400 beds) and Gold Coast University Hospital (approximately 600 beds). Wards included in the trial admit medical patients, of whom large numbers are aged over 70 years.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>The WA Health Translation Network’s Clinical Trials and Data Management Centre (CTDMC) will administer the randomisation process. The allocation list has been generated prior to trial commencement by the CTDMC using computer-generated random numbers and organised such that recruitment to the two study arms (WA and QLD) occurs at an approximately equal rate. The treatment allocation list is stored as a password protected file at Curtin University and is only accessible to the trial’s CTDMC administrators. The research assistants (RAs) enter all baseline data directly into a secure online database. Completion of baseline data entry automatically triggers the allocation of the dyad (caregiver and care recipient) to the next number in the sequence and triggers an alert to the project manager, who contacts the FECH+ nurse if the dyad is allocated to the intervention group.</p>
                <p>The investigators on the trial team are not involved in recruitment or data collection and all investigators, including the statistical team, are blinded to group allocation until after analyses are completed. RAs who enrol patients and conduct baseline and outcome assessments are blinded to group allocation throughout the study. The project manager is the only team member to see the group allocation as she manages the trial procedure. The nurses who deliver the intervention know which participants receive the intervention, but are not involved in baseline or outcome data collection. Hospital staff who organise discharge services remain blinded to participants’ enrolment into the study. Participants are not specifically informed of their group allocation but cannot be blinded to the intervention they receive. Participants will be instructed at enrolment and during monthly phone calls not to divulge their allocation to research staff. RAs who conduct baseline and outcome assessments are based in the hospitals while the nurses who deliver the intervention are located at the universities, to maintain blinding of staff.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome (primary aim i) is caregivers’ HRQOL at 6 months after hospital discharge measured using the 35-item Assessment of Quality of Life—eight dimensions (AQoL-8D).<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> The AQoL-8D captures psycho-social as well as physical health domains (Independent Living, Happiness, Mental Health, Coping, Relationships, Self-Worth, Pain, Senses) and can be administered by telephone. The focus on psychosocial domains makes this instrument appropriate for our study since the dominant factor affecting choice of a multi-attribute utility instrument is its ability to capture facets of health states relevant to the research question.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> It has established validity and reliability, and good psychometric properties which capture psycho-social as well as physical health domains.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Australian norms have been established for the AQol-8D.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes are chosen to understand possible causal mechanisms of the intervention effect. For example, improved preparedness to care and reduction of caregiver strain and distress may improve caregivers HRQOL. Better prepared caregivers may in turn more effectively manage care recipients’ symptoms and functional limitations. The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale (PCS), Family Appraisal of Caregiving Questionnaire-Palliative Care (FACQ), Symptom Assessment Scale (SAS) and Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (BADLI) assessment instruments were previously evaluated in our pilot trial as being feasible to administer to caregivers over the telephone.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Secondary outcomes are:</p>

Differences in demographic and baseline health status variables between groups at baseline will be compared using χ<sup>2</sup>, t-tests or non-parametric Wilcoxon two-sample tests as appropriate. Changes from baseline in the AQoL-8D score for the caregiver will be calculated to each time point and tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk statistic; if not normally distributed, a Box–Cox transformation will be applied to the measure before further analysis. Comparison of the changes in AQoL-8D scores between control and intervention groups will be performed using a mixed regression model with the caregiver group identified as a random effect. This model takes into account the correlation between repeated measurements on each individual. An interaction term between time and group will be introduced into the model to test whether rates of change in the outcome differ between groups.

A very small effect size of 0.06 has been described as being of clinical importance.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> However, we anticipate a larger effect size, based on: (a) our assessment of changes in health, measured using a health-related quality of life questionnaire [short form survey -12 item (SF12)]<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> during our preliminary study,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in which we obtained a positive change in physical health (0.17) and mental health (0.22) from baseline until immediately post-intervention; (b) that the AQoL-8D is a more appropriate outcome measure as psychosocial components of health are emphasised more; and (c) that we are now implementing an expanded intervention with longer follow-up. Therefore, we designed this study with 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.22.

                <p>Two consumer advocates are members of the trial team. This study was developed with caregiver input from Carers WA and the WA Consumer and Community Health Research Network, prior to submitting the application for funding. The consumer input assisted to ensure the appropriateness of the intervention and study processes. This included assisting with wording of documents for the trial and aspects of procedure and intervention delivery. The two consumer advocates are ongoing members of the trial team and continue to inform and give feedback about the study procedure. Both consumer organisations will contribute to the dissemination of results and future presentations and translation projects.</p>

                <p>The study has been approved by hospitals (the Sir Charles Gairdner Osborne Park Health Care Group, Gold Coast Health Care Group) and universities (Curtin and Griffith) human research ethics committees. Approvals for linked health data for economic evaluation have been obtained from the Data Linkage Branches of WA Health, QLD Health and Services Australia (for national health administered data). All caregivers will provide written, informed consent to participate in the trial. Care recipients will also provide written, informed consent to participate in the trial. Participant information and consent forms are provided as online supplementary files (see <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 2</xref>). Cognitive impairment may occur in a care recipient who forms part of the dyad. A waiver of consent has been approved in WA for these care recipients to be included in the study. If these care recipients are encountered in QLD, we will seek consent from the appropriate substitute decision-maker.</p>

                <p>To disseminate findings, Carers WA and Carers QLD, (two peak organisations who provide carer advocacy and support) will be asked to publicise the study completion and findings on their website. Our consumer advocates will provide advice and assistance to maximise engagement strategies through established state and national consumer networks. Papers will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and abstracts submitted to relevant conferences. Practitioner and consumer forums will be held in participating hospitals and state health districts. Study participants will be provided with a summary of study findings on request.</p>
