                  <p>Control of human hookworm infection would be greatly aided by the development of an effective vaccine. We aimed to develop a live attenuated human hookworm vaccine.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This was a two-part clinical trial done at Q-Pharm in Brisbane (QLD, Australia) using a live ultraviolet C (UVC)-attenuated <italic>Necator americanus</italic> larvae vaccine. Part one was an open-label, dose-finding study using 50 L3 larvae suspended in water to a volume of 200 μL, attenuated with UVC exposure of 700 μJ (L3–700) or 1000 μJ (L3–1000). Part two was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, challenge study, in which participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to the vaccine group or placebo group. Healthy hookworm-naive adults aged 18–65 years with body-mass index 18–35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> received two doses of either placebo (Tabasco sauce) or vaccine (50 L3–700) on day 1 and day 42, followed by challenge with 30 unattenuated L3 larvae to both groups. All participants received a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole 4 weeks after each inoculation and a 3-day course (400 mg orally daily) initiated on day 161 after the challenge phase, to eliminate any remaining infection. The primary outcome of part 1 was the level of larval attenuation the resulted in a grade 2 or 3 dermal adverse event. The primary outcome of part 2 was safety and tolerability, assessed by frequency and severity of adverse events in all randomly assigned participants. Prespecified exploratory outcomes in the challenge study were faecal <italic>N americanus</italic> DNA concentration, the number of <italic>N americanus</italic> larvae recovered per g of faeces cultured, hookworm antigen-specific serum IgG antibody responses, and hookworm antigen-specific peripheral blood cytokine responses. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12617001007325).</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Sept 19, 2017, and Oct 24, 2018, seven participants were enrolled into three cohorts in part one (two participants in cohort 1, who received L3-700; two participants in cohort 2, who received L3-700; and three participants in cohort 3, who received L3-1000) and a further 15 were enrolled into part two. There were no serious adverse events in part one or part two. In part one, a greater number of skin penetration sites were observed after administration of L3-700 than L3-1000 (mean 15·75 [95% CI 11·18 to 20·32] with L3-700 <italic>vs</italic> 4·33 [–1·40 to 10·07] with L3-1000). Similarly, greater erythema (median 225 mm<sup>2</sup> [IQR 150 to 325] <italic>vs</italic> 25 mm<sup>2</sup> [12·5 to 80]) and a longer duration of the dermal reaction (median 8·0 days [IQR 3·5 to 11·5] <italic>vs</italic> 2·0 days [2·0 to 4·5]) were observed after L3-700 than L3-1000. The mean number of adverse events per participant did not differ between the groups (3·25 [95% CI 1·48 to 5·02] <italic>vs</italic> 3·00 [1·04 to 4·96]). Thus, L3-700 was used for vaccination in part two. In part two, ten participants were randomly assigned to receive L3-700 and five to placebo. Significantly more adverse events occurred after vaccination with attenuated larvae than with placebo (incident rate ratio [IRR] 2·13 [95% CI 2·09 to 5·51]; p=0·0030). There was no difference between groups in the frequency of adverse events after challenge (IRR 1·25 [0·78 to 2·01]; p=0·36). Most adverse events were mild in severity, with only one severe adverse event reported (erythematous and indurated pruritic rash &gt;100 mm in a vaccine group participant after challenge). The eosinophil count increased in all participants after challenge, with a significantly greater increase among vaccinated participants than placebo participants (1·55 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L [IQR 0·92 to 1·81] in the vaccine group <italic>vs</italic> 0·49 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L [0·43 to 0·63] in the placebo group; p=0·014). Vaccinated participants had an IgG response to larval extract after challenge that was higher than that in placebo participants (increase in IgG titre 0·22 [IQR 0·10 to 0·41] <italic>vs</italic> 0·03 [–0·40 to 0·06]; p=0·020). Significantly fewer larvae per g of faeces were recovered in the vaccine group than in the placebo group after challenge (median larvae per g 0·8 [IQR 0·00 to 3·91] <italic>vs</italic> 10·2 [5·1 to 18·1]; p=0·014). The concentration of <italic>N americanus</italic> DNA in faeces was not significantly different between the vaccinated group and the placebo group (log<sub>10</sub> DNA intensity 4·28 [95% CI 3·92 to 4·63] <italic>vs</italic> 4·88 [4·31 to 5·46]; p=0·14). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinated participants exhibited significantly greater cytokine production at day 112 than placebo participants for IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 (p&lt;0·05), but not IL-10.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Vaccination with UVC-attenuated <italic>N americanus</italic> larvae is well tolerated, induces humoral and cellular responses to hookworm antigens, and reduces larval output after challenge with unattenuated larvae. Larger studies are required to confirm protective efficacy.</p>

              <p id="para10"><italic>Ancylostoma duodenale, Ancylostoma ceylanicum</italic>, and <italic>Necator americanus</italic> are soil-transmitted helminths that reside in the small intestines of their human hosts where they feed on blood. Globally, 450 million people have chronic hookworm infection, which results in an estimated 2·1 million disability-adjusted life-years lost and accounts for more than US$100 billion in global economic losses.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Mass drug administration using either albendazole or mebendazole to school-aged children is recommended for control of intestinal nematodes in endemic populations. However, in high-prevalence populations, reinfection within 6 months results in infection intensities that equal or even exceed pretreatment levels,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and modelling indicates that such programmes will not result in elimination without high and frequent coverage over a long period of time.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para20">Alternative measures for control of human hookworm disease are therefore required, such as an effective vaccine. After initially promising phase 1 trial results, development of the <italic>N americanus</italic> ancylostoma-secreted protein 2 (<italic>Na-</italic>ASP-2) subunit vaccine was terminated because of urticarial hypersensitivity reactions that occurred when the vaccine was administered to participants in an area endemic for hookworm.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>

                  <p id="para70">We searched PubMed for clinical trials and animal studies assessing hookworm vaccines from database inception up to July 30, 2021, with the search terms “<italic>Necator</italic>” OR “<italic>Ancylostoma</italic>” OR “hookworm” AND “vaccin*”. No language restriction or inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Of the 422 results, 61 described hookworm vaccination experiments. Four phase 1 clinical trials were identified investigating recombinant protein vaccines in hookworm-naive and exposed populations. The remaining 57 studies detailed vaccination in animals with a variety of vaccine candidates comprising recombinant proteins, attenuated larvae, abbreviated infection, and infection in non-permissive hosts. Seven of these studies describe controlled challenge trials of a radiation-attenuated <italic>Ancylostoma caninum</italic> larvae vaccine in dogs, which reliably produced immunity to hookworm disease. This product was then commercialised and is the only marketed hookworm vaccine to date. The success of live attenuated hookworm vaccines was subsequently confirmed in seven additional animal studies with attenuation using ionising radiation, ultraviolet C (UVC) light, and 5-fluorouracil. The fact that there are no publications detailing negative results associated with live attenuated hookworm vaccines might be indicative of significant publication bias.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para160">In-vitro studies demonstrated that UVC exposure produced dose-dependent larval attenuation, as assessed in a thermally induced motility assay (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 5</xref>), with reliably detectable attenuation developing after exposure to 700 μJ. It was unknown what effect UVC exposure would have on larval skin penetration, an essential property for dermal delivery of this attenuated vaccine, so a dose-finding study (part one) was first done.</p>
                <p id="para170">Full details of larval production, attenuation, and administration are in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 3–6</xref>). Briefly, larvae of <italic>N americanus</italic> were cultured by a modified Harada-Mori culture method from the faeces of an experimentally infected donor, as previously described.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> 7–10-day-old larvae were harvested and viability was estimated using a thermally induced motility assay.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> For each batch, viability was assessed on the day of harvest and after storage for 14 days (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 5</xref>). All larvae were administered to participants within 48 h of harvest and within 24 h of preparation (washing and decontamination in antiseptic). Attenuation was done at the clinical trial site immediately before inoculation by placing 96-well plates loaded with 25±3 L3 in 100 μL of sterile water per well in a UVC cross linker (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA, USA) set to deliver the desired UVC exposure.</p>
                <p id="para180">Dermal application of 50 unattenuated L3 has previously resulted in tolerable dermal reactions.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Thus, cohort 1 received 50 L3 attenuated with 700 μJ UVC exposure in water to a volume of 200 μL, administered by dermal application to the forearm of participants on day 1.

A staggered sentinel approach was used for cohort 1 whereby a single participant was initially inoculated and the dermal reaction was reviewed on day 3 before inoculation of the second participant.

                <p id="para190">For part one, adverse event and skin penetration data were reviewed by the safety review team after each dose cohort to establish the dose of larvae and degree of attenuation to be used in the following cohort.

                <p id="para200">In the challenge study (part two), participants received either attenuated larvae or placebo in a volume of 200 μL by dermal application to the forearm on day 1, with a second inoculation performed 6 weeks later on day 42.

Participants returned to the clinic for follow-up visits on days 87, 112, and 126 before a 3-day course of oral albendazole (400 mg daily) was initiated on day 161.

Associations between treatment groups and an adverse event severity index calculated per participant (1 for each mild event, 2 for moderate, and 3 for severe) were assessed using a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Categorical clinical measures were summarised by frequency and percentage and continuous clinical measures were summarised by mean and SD or median and IQR for non-normally distributed data. Continuous measures such as dermal reactions and hookworm larvae characteristics were compared between treatment groups using a two-sample <italic>t</italic> test for normally distributed data, or a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for non-normally distributed data. Paired comparisons of continuous measures between timepoints within vaccine or challenge trial stages were performed using a paired <italic>t</italic> test for normally distributed data or an Exact sign test for non-normal and non-symmetrical data. Associations between continuous clinical measures were assessed using a Spearman's rank order correlation for non-normally distributed data. Associations between faecal hookworm DNA content (continuous) and treatment groups were assessed using a generalised linear model (identity link) with a randomised block design.

              <p id="para280">Adverse events were reported by all participants in part one and were mild (grade 1) in severity; dermal reactions were observed universally and accounted for most adverse events. The mean number of adverse events per participant did not differ substantially between participants inoculated with larvae attenuated with 700 μJ or 1000 μJ UVC (3·25 [95% CI 1·48–5·02] <italic>vs</italic> 3·00 [1·04–4·96]; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). No serious adverse events occurred and no participant reported respiratory symptoms. Increased eosinophil counts were not detected. One participant who received L3-700 reported transient diarrhoea lasting less than 24 h that commenced 27 days after the administration of larvae; the diarrhoea resolved before albendazole administration. Another participant who received L3-700 developed normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 10·6 g/dL) at day 28. This participant had a history of hypothyroidism requiring thyroxine replacement therapy. It was discovered that the participant had been non-compliant with this therapy and had a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of more than 100 mIU/L. The participant's haemoglobin returned to normal upon resumption of thyroxine replacement. Because the L3-700 dose produced a grade 1 dermal reaction, which met the prespecified criteria for the vaccine inoculum, the safety review team approved progression to the challenge study (part two) using L3-700 as the dose for vaccination.</p>

There were no notable changes in haemoglobin or haematocrit.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Severity of treatment-related adverse events in the challenge

              <p id="para320">Faecal samples were collected from all participants on day 161 (43 samples; 13 participants produced three samples and two participants produced two samples over the 72-h collection period) for coproculture and to quantify the faecal concentration of <italic>N americanus</italic> DNA by qPCR. One participant in the placebo group submitted insufficient sample for coproculture (6 g), allowing only qPCR. Additionally, the qPCR assay on the sample from another participant in the placebo group was unsuccessful (did not pass quality control amplification of the control gene target). Thus, coproculture and qPCR data were only available for four participants in the placebo group. Significantly fewer larvae per g of faeces were recovered in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (median larvae per g 0·8 [IQR 0·00–3·91] in the vaccine group <italic>vs</italic> 10·2 [5·1–18·1] in the placebo group; p=0·014; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3D</xref>).

              <p id="para330">In an exploratory analysis, there was no significant increase in eosinophil counts after vaccination, with a median increase in peripheral eosinophil count at day 70 compared with baseline (day 1) of 0·04 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L (IQR 0·04 to 0·11; p=0·11) among the vaccine group participants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>
). After challenge, an increase in eosinophil count occurred in all participants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>), with a significantly greater median increase among vaccine group participants than placebo group participants at day 161 (1·55 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L [IQR 0·92 to 1·81] in the vaccine group <italic>vs</italic> 0·49 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L [0·43 to 0·63] in the placebo group; p=0·014). Total IgE increased in the vaccinated group but not in the placebo group (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 11</xref>). The median increase in total IgE from day 1 to day 112 was 1·0 kIU/L (−15·0 to 1·0) in the placebo group compared with 12·5 kIU/L (2·0 to 21·0) in the vaccinated group (p=0·0195). An increase in <italic>N americanus</italic> L3 soluble antigen-specific IgG titre was also observed in the vaccinated group, particularly after challenge with unattenuated larvae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>).

              <p id="para340">To the best of our knowledge, this study describes the first investigation of an attenuated helminth vaccine in humans and is the first time that an experimental helminth vaccine has been tested for efficacy with a controlled parasite challenge. Overall, the results of the study indicated that this approach is safe, with no serious adverse events observed. Both the attenuated larvae and challenge larvae were well tolerated, with no rescue medication required. As expected, participants who received vaccination with attenuated hookworm larvae reported more adverse events (principally dermal reactions) than those who received placebo. After challenge with unattenuated larvae in all participants, adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in both groups. Dermal reactions became more prominent with repeat exposure to larvae, with larger areas of erythema, the development of induration, blistering, and exudation at the site. This phenomenon has been noted previously, most compellingly in a series of nine patients who received repeated inoculation with 400 <italic>A duodenale</italic> larvae as treatment for polycythaemia and hypertension.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para350">Relatively little is known about the immunological correlates of natural or acquired immune protection against hookworm infection in humans. Although parasite-specific antibody responses (IgE and IgG) and eosinophilia are features of natural hookworm infections in endemic areas,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and were increased in the vaccine group participants in our study, it is unclear whether these immune responses are protective in the context of natural infection or vaccination. Animal models of hookworm infection suggest that eosinophils might be associated with protection against helminth reinfection, particularly while the parasites transit the lungs.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our study, two participants from the placebo group had unexplained high antigen-specific IgG titres at baseline. One of these participants also had an increased total IgE (which did not change after challenge). We have no explanation for the increased baseline IgG readings in these two participants. However, given the absence of a compatible exposure history, pre-existing infection is an unlikely explanation. The likelihood that this is a spurious result is supported by the normalisation of parasite-specific IgG levels by day 28, and by the absence of cell-mediated immunity correlates. Similarly, the significance of an increased total IgE level in the absence of allergy, atopy, or exposure to parasites is questionable.</p>
              <p id="para360">Vaccinated participants in the present study also displayed a mixed cytokine response to hookworm challenge, involving type 2 (IL-4 and IL-5), type 1 (IFNγ, TNF, and IL-2), and regulatory cytokines, which is consistent with that seen in natural infections<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and in experimental infection studies.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Notably, increased IL-5 has been correlated with the development of natural immunity to reinfection in endemic areas.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Geiger and colleagues described similar production of TNFα, INFγ, IL-5, and IL-13 following stimulation with hookworm antigens to those observed in the control group of this study after challenge.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> However, the magnitude of response to stimulation in the vaccine group was much greater than in the placebo group, consistent with the development of an immune response. The positive association between increased antiparasitic cellular, antibody, and cytokine responses identified in our study warrants further investigation, such as detailed analysis to identify memory T cell subsets and antibody targets to guide future vaccine design strategies.</p>
              <p id="para370">Parasitological outcomes were an exploratory component of part two of this study. Part one was not designed to assess for patency after inoculation with attenuated larvae, and all participants were treated with albendazole at 4 weeks. As it is possible that attenuation is incomplete, in future studies it will be important to assess for patency after a longer interval. Faecal microscopy was not done in this study. Traditionally, faecal egg counts have been used to assess efficacy of anthelmintic chemotherapy, although the usefulness of the so-called faecal egg count reduction test is modest at best,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and a gold standard for diagnosis and quantification of hookworm burden does not exist.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Considerable day-to-day variation in faecal egg count is observed, particularly in controlled human hookworm infection where parasite burden is low.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Furthermore, without prompt preservation or refrigeration of faecal samples, the sensitivity of microscopy for detection of <italic>N americanus</italic> eggs diminishes significantly within hours of faecal sample production<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and preservation or refrigeration would prevent coproculture. In this trial, because parasite burden was an exploratory outcome, it was established that requiring the participants to manipulate their faecal samples (for preservation or refrigeration) or attend the trial site within hours of defecation was not feasible. Molecular estimation of faecal hookworm DNA content was therefore used, and has previously been described to have greater sensitivity than parasitological methods.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> However, at low faecal egg density, estimation of parasite burden might be confounded by other issues such as density-dependent worm fecundity, and the maturation of embryonated eggs with variable numbers of nuclei.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Coproculture has been demonstrated to be more sensitive than microscopy for diagnosis of <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic> and hookworm infection<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> and has been used to confirm patency of infection with <italic>N americanus</italic> in microscopy-negative participants in clinical trials.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In the current study, there was a significant reduction in the number of hookworm larvae recovered upon faecal culture between the vaccinated and placebo groups, despite there being no significant difference in <italic>N americanus</italic> faecal DNA content. In future trials, assessment of the protective effect of vaccination using a larger challenge dose would be informative, although there is a risk of increased dermal and gastrointestinal adverse events.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Similarly, as patency has been shown to take up to 100 days after inoculation to develop,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> increasing the duration of observation after challenge and the number of faecal samples analysed might improve the reliability of parasitological endpoints.</p>
              <p id="para380">Interpretation of the exploratory outcomes in this trial is limited by its small sample size. As a phase 1 study, with little previous safety and efficacy data to guide study design, this study could not be powered for an efficacy outcome. Using the observed difference in faecal hookworm DNA content by qPCR, we estimate that 35 participants (26 vaccine group and nine placebo group) would be required to establish efficacy with 80% power. An additional limitation of this study is the absence of an active comparator group. It is possible that serial inoculation with hookworm larvae followed by administration of albendazole might produce similar results to the use of attenuation, although this effect has not been observed in field studies where participants are constantly exposed to infective L3 and receive regular anthelmintic treatment.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Furthermore, there are practical limitations to the scalability of an attenuated hookworm larvae vaccine. Larval production remains dependent on culture of faeces from infected donors, is labour intensive, and the product has a limited shelf life with specific storage requirements.</p>
              <p id="para390">Despite the limitations of our study, it provides robust proof of concept that controlled human hookworm infection can be used to assess the efficacy of hookworm therapeutics. Additionally, the observed development of sensitisation to larvae and parasite-specific immune response, trend toward lower faecal hookworm DNA, and significant reduction in culturable larvae per g of faeces are important findings that support the hypothesis that protective immunity to hookworm infection can be induced in humans by vaccination. Further work is needed to optimise the protocols for vaccination and challenge, including increasing the challenge dose on the basis of the favourable profile of adverse events observed in a recent dose-escalation safety study.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
