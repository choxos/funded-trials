                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Leadership is a valuable skill that can be taught in school, and which may have benefits within and beyond the classroom. Learning to Lead (L2L) is a student-led, primary school-based leadership program whereby older ‘<italic toggle="yes">peer leaders’</italic> deliver a fundamental movement skills (FMS) program to younger ‘<italic toggle="yes">peers’</italic> within their own school.</p>

                  <title>Aim</title>
                  <p>The aims of the study are to determine the efficacy of a peer-led FMS intervention on: (i) <italic toggle="yes">peer leaders’</italic> (aged 10 to 12 years) leadership effectiveness (primary outcome), leadership self-efficacy, well-being, and time on-task in the classroom; (ii) <italic toggle="yes">peers’</italic> (aged 8 to 10 years) physical activity levels, actual and perceived FMS competency, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular power, and executive functioning; and (iii) teachers’ (referred to as ‘<italic toggle="yes">school champions</italic>’) work-related stress and well-being.</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>L2L will be evaluated using a two-arm parallel group cluster randomised controlled trial. Twenty schools located within a two-hour drive of the University of Newcastle, Australia will be recruited. We will recruit 80 students (40 <italic toggle="yes">peer leaders</italic> and 40 <italic toggle="yes">peers</italic>) from each school (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 1,600). L2L will be implemented in three phases: Phase 1 –<italic toggle="yes">school champions’</italic> training via a professional learning workshop; Phase 2 –<italic toggle="yes">school champions’</italic> delivery of leadership lessons to the <italic toggle="yes">peer leaders</italic>; and Phase 3 –<italic toggle="yes">peer leaders’</italic> delivery of the FMS program to their younger <italic toggle="yes">peers</italic>. The FMS program, consisting of 12 x 30-minute lessons, will be delivered over the course of one school term (10 weeks). Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline (between mid-March to June, Terms 1 and 2), intervention end (mid-August to September, Term 3), and follow-up (November to mid-December, Term 4. This trial was prospectively registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR); registration number: ACTRN12621000376842.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>‘Leadership’ refers to the behavioural processes through which an individual influences others toward achieving specific goals or objectives [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and is a valuable life skill that can be developed in the school setting. Providing children with opportunities to develop their leadership skills has been shown to improve their academic outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], increase their likelihood to take initiative in the classroom [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and may improve learning autonomy (e.g., studying, completing homework, reviewing lessons etc) [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Improving leadership skills at school may also transfer to non-school settings and other life stages (e.g., employment in early adulthood). Surprisingly, there have been very few school-based programs focussed on developing students’ leadership ability. Further, previous peer-led programs have predominantly focused on the benefits for those being led (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">peers</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], rather than exploring benefits for the <italic toggle="yes">leaders</italic> themselves.</p>
              <p>Schools have been identified as key settings for physical activity promotion in children and adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Participating in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is vital for children’s physical, social, psychological, and cognitive development [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279661.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Concerningly, less than 20% of Australian children are sufficiently active [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, many children finish primary school without mastering important fundamental movement skills (FMS); e.g., throwing, catching, running, and kicking [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While schools are an ideal environment to target children’s physical activity and movement skills, the effects of such interventions are typically modest [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The average effect of school-based physical activity interventions on objectively measured MVPA is less than two minutes per day [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further, when interventions are scaled-up, they often experience significant ‘voltage drop’ [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, a 2021 systematic review found that when physical activity interventions are scaled-up, they typically achieve less than 60% of their pre-scale effect size [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. School-based physical activity interventions can be challenging to implement [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the problems of which are further compounded when teachers lack the necessary competencies, time, and support to enable effective program delivery [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Accordingly, schools require physical activity interventions that are both effective and scalable.</p>
              <p>Australian teachers report high levels of work-related stress and burnout [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Sources of stress for school teachers include managing student discipline, high workloads, poor working conditions, and lack of support from school administrators [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279661.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A recent study of Australian teachers (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 960) concluded that improving measures for managing student behaviour was among teachers’ top priorities to improve their own well-being [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In line with this, negative student-teacher relationships are associated with lower occupational well-being among teachers [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Providing students with opportunities to develop their leadership skills may help to manage their behaviour within and beyond the classroom. This may improve the relationship with their teacher, mitigating teacher stress and improving teacher well-being.</p>
              <p>We conducted a pilot study to evaluate a school-based peer leadership program in two primary schools in New South Wales (NSW), Australia (N = 224 students) [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The intervention resulted in large improvements in <italic toggle="yes">peer leaders’</italic> effectiveness (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 1.09) and <italic toggle="yes">peers’</italic> FMS competency (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.95). Importantly, the program was well received by teachers and students, increasing the likelihood of program dissemination. Although classroom behaviour was not formally measured, teachers anecdotally reported improvements in students’ classroom behaviour following participation in our leadership program. Despite these positive findings, the pilot study involved a quasi-experimental design in two schools and our findings need to be confirmed using a robust cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>
              <p>Previous investigations have demonstrated that peer leadership programs can have a range of benefits for those being led, such as improvements in physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], mathematical ability [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and nutrition knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The current project builds upon the findings of our previous pilot study and will examine the effects of a student-led, school-based leadership program known as Learning to Lead (L2L) on students’ behavioural, psychological, and cognitive outcomes. In Australia, students in their last two years of primary school are referred to as Stage 3 students and are typically between the ages of 10 and 12. Henceforth, these students will be referred to as <italic toggle="yes">‘peer leaders’</italic>. Students in the preceding two years of schooling are referred to as Stage 2 students and are typically between the ages of 8 and 10. These students will be referred to as ‘<italic toggle="yes">peers’</italic>. The primary aim is to determine the impact of L2L on <italic toggle="yes">peer leaders’</italic> leadership effectiveness. The secondary aims are to determine the impact of L2L on i) <italic toggle="yes">peer leaders’</italic> self-reported leadership effectiveness, leadership self-efficacy, well-being, and time on-task in the classroom; ii) <italic toggle="yes">peers’</italic> physical activity levels, executive functioning, health-related fitness, and actual and perceived FMS competency; and (iii) teachers’ work-related stress and well-being. We will also examine whether changes in FMS competency mediate changes in executive functioning. Further, this study will be the first to test the hypothesis that improving children’s leadership skills may have ‘spill over’ effects for leaders’ time ‘on-task’ in the classroom and teachers’ work-related stress and well-being.</p>

                <p>L2L will be evaluated using a two-arm parallel group cluster RCT. Schools will be randomly allocated to a group by an independent researcher via a computer-based random number generator to either an intervention or wait-list control. In Australia, the school year is divided into four terms, each approximately 10 weeks in duration. The study will be conducted across two cohorts (2022 and 2023), with assessments at baseline (between mid-March to June, Terms 1 and 2), intervention end (mid-August to September, Term 3), and follow-up (November to mid-December, Term 4). See <xref rid="pone.0279661.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> for the SPIRIT Schedule Of Enrolment, Interventions, And Assessments. The trial has been prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ACTRN12621000376842). The design, conduct and reporting will adhere to CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] checklists. The trial has been approved by the University of Newcastle’s ethics committee (reference number: H-2020-0109) and the NSW Department of Education’s State Education Research Applications Process (SERAP; reference number: 2020143).</p>

                <p>To ensure 80% power to detect a conservative effect of <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.50 for leadership effectiveness (adjusted between-group difference of ∼0.4 units with standard deviation of 0.8), we required 128 <italic toggle="yes">peer leaders</italic> for a non-clustered trial (two-tailed, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.05). However, as recommended by CONSORT [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we adjusted our power calculation for the clustering of effects at the school level using a correction factor of [1+ (m − 1) × ICC], where m = participants per school and ICC = intraclass correlation coefficient. Assuming an average class size of 20 participating students, two classes per school and an ICC for leadership effectiveness of 0.15, the correction factor is 5.68 [i.e., 1 + (40−1) × 0.15]. The required sample size to achieve 80% power with α levels set at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05 is 727 (i.e., 128 x 5.68). Operating under the assumption that each school has approximately 60 x Stage 3 students (two classes), with a conservative response rate of 67% and allowing for an expected 10% loss to follow-up, we will aim to recruit at least 40 Stage 3 students from each of 20 schools (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 800). We will also recruit 40 Stage 2 students per school (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 800).</p>

                <p>Government primary schools located within a two-hour drive of the main campus of the University of Newcastle, Australia will serve as the sampling frame. Schools will be eligible if they have at least two Stage 3 classes and are not participating in any other leadership or physical activity programs. Schools will be invited via email and follow-up phone call. In 2022 (Cohort 1), we will randomly select 10 schools from the list of eligible and consenting schools and identify up to 10 replacement schools. Once we have 10 schools, we will pair-match schools according to their size and level of socio-economic disadvantage [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The same process will be repeated for Cohort 2 in 2023, until we reach our total sample size of 20 schools.</p>

                <title>Theoretical framework</title>
                <p>L2L is guided by transformational leadership theory (not to be confused with transformative leadership) [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which has a well-established evidence base [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279661.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and is appropriate for educational settings [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Research conducted across different settings has demonstrated that transformational leadership is associated with positive outcomes, including higher levels of empowerment [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], motivation [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and performance [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Transformational leaders demonstrate behaviours that empower and inspire others, they transcend their own self-interests and provide others with the confidence to achieve high levels of functioning [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Research conducted across different settings has demonstrated that transformational leadership provides a range of positive outcomes for those being led [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Transformational leadership theory consists of four interrelated behavioural dimensions: (i) <italic toggle="yes">Idealised influence</italic>- fostering trust and respect by role modelling ideal behaviour, (ii) <italic toggle="yes">Inspirational motivation</italic>- displaying optimism, enthusiasm, and having high expectations of others, (iii) <italic toggle="yes">Intellectual stimulation-</italic> encouraging others to consider issues from a different perspective, and (iv) <italic toggle="yes">Individualised consideration</italic>- recognising and supporting others’ physical and psychological needs. Of particular relevance to the current study, it has been demonstrated that: (i) teachers can learn to utilise transformational teaching practices and inspire adolescents to be more physically active [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; and (ii) Grade 6 students can become transformational leaders in their schools and improve younger children’s fundamental movement skill (FMS) competency [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Intervention description</title>
                <p>L2L is a multi-component primary school program co-developed with an advisory group consisting of key stakeholders (education experts, physical activity experts, teachers, and school principals). The program is informed by the tenets of transformational leadership theory [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and based on previous interventions designed by our research team [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279661.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Importantly, key stakeholders have recommended the L2L program align with existing school-based leadership opportunities. As such, our research team will work with schools to ensure the tenets of transformational leadership theory are operationalised during the program. The L2L program is guided by the conceptual framework developed by Kelloway and Barling [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and refined by Beauchamp [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This framework involves the following components: (i) explanation of transformational leadership principles, (ii) demonstration of leadership behaviours using real-world examples that are relevant for children, (iii) providing opportunities for children to practice the leadership behaviours, (iv) receiving feedback on the implementation of leadership behaviours, and (v) development of self-regulatory strategies to support sustained implementation. Integral to this framework is the opportunity for <italic toggle="yes">peer leaders</italic> to intellectually engage with the meaning of ‘leadership’ and how their own behaviours can influence others in positive and (if not enacted appropriately) negative ways.</p>

Using the common stem ‘<italic toggle="yes">The student that I’m rating</italic>…’, the questionnaire includes the following items: ‘behaves as someone that other students can trust’ (idealized influence), ‘is enthusiastic about what other students are capable of achieving’ (inspirational motivation), ‘encourages students to think for themselves’ (intellectual stimulation), and ‘shows that s/he cares about the students s/he is teaching’ (individualised consideration)’. The measure requires respondents to answer four questions for each student, using a five-point scale ranging from ‘0 –<italic toggle="yes">not at all</italic>’ to ‘4 –<italic toggle="yes">frequently’</italic>. The scores of each item are summed to create a composite score.

To increase standardisation across schools, where possible the observations will take place during Mathematics or English lessons at the same time of day. During each 30-minute observation period (starting 5 minutes after students enter the classroom), research assistants will assess the on-task and off-task behaviour of six randomly selected students (5 minutes per student). For each lesson, two observers will randomly select 6 boys and 6 girls (i.e., 12 students in total) and the order in which they are observed (teachers and students will not know who is being observed). The same students will be assessed at the end of the intervention. Observers will listen to an audio file via headphones, which will inform them when to observe and record (in 15 second intervals). After each interval, the observers will record the student’s behaviour by recording an appropriate code (i.e., actively engaged, passively engaged, off-task motor, off-task verbal, or off-task passive) using an observation recording sheet. Time spent on- and off-task during the lesson will be expressed as a percentage of the 30-minute classroom observation.</p>

Children will be filmed performing three trials (inclusive of one practice trial) of each of the three skills. These skills were selected due to their transferability into a variety of different sports that are popular among Australian children. Research assistants will assess the videos according to the performance criteria. Each skill component will be scored a “1” if observable and performed correctly or “0” if performed incorrectly. This procedure will be completed for each of the two main trials, and trial scores will be summed to calculate a total score for each skill.

The test concludes upon voluntary exhaustion, or when they fail to reach the line concurrent with the audio signal on two successive occasions (warning provided by assessor). The participants are provided verbal encouragement during this test. Performance on this test has moderate-to-high criterion-related validity for estimating maximum oxygen uptake in children (r = 0.78, CI = 0.72 to 0.85) [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>

The tests will be administered in groups, whereby up to 20 students will complete the tests on their tablets at the same time.</p>
                  <p>Inhibition will be assessed using the ‘Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test’. This test is a measure of the ability to inhibit visual attention to irrelevant task dimensions. In children and adolescents, it has demonstrated convergent validity with ‘Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System–Inhibition (D-KEFS)’ and discriminant validity from the ‘Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Fourth Edition (PPVT-4)’ [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Test-retest reliability is high (ICC = .95, 95% CI: .92 to .97) in children and adolescents when tested between 7 and 21 days after initial assessment [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For each trial, the participant must pay attention to a central directional arrow. The arrow is flanked by other arrows which either point in the same (congruent) or different (incongruent) directions to the central arrow. The purpose of the task is to indicate which direction the middle arrow is pointing. The scoring algorithm integrates accuracy, a suitable measure in early childhood, and reaction time, a more relevant measure of adult performance on this task, and provides a score from 0 to 10. There are 40 trials and the average time to complete the task is 4 minutes.</p>
                  <p>To assess shifting (also referred to as ‘attention switching’, or ‘task-switching’), the ‘Dimensional Change Card Sort Test’ will be administered. This is a test of one’s ability to shift between multiple tasks, operations, or mental sets [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This test has demonstrated convergent validity with D-KEFS and discriminant validity from PPVT-4 in children and adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The test-retest reliability is high (ICC = .94, 95% CI: .92 to .96) [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For this test, participants are presented with a stimulus and instructed to match it to one of two stimuli either according to shape or to colour. Participants are presented with a ‘mixed’ block, whereby colour is relevant on the majority of trials with occasional, unpredictable shifts to shape. The words ‘colour’ or ‘shape’ appear on the screen and are presented audibly by the program before the presentation of the stimuli. The scoring is weighted towards accuracy for children and towards reaction time for adults. The test produces a score from 0 to 10 and takes approximately four minutes to complete the 40 trials.</p>

              <p>There is consistent evidence that school-based, peer-led programs are beneficial for those students being led [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279661.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279661.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], though very few studies focus on the benefits for students leading these programs. Further, despite these programs being led by students, changes in students’ leadership ability are rarely examined as a study outcome. L2L is a multicomponent primary school-based leadership program that will focus on improving the leadership abilities of older children via their delivery of an FMS program to younger children. The development of L2L was informed by transformational leadership theory and our pilot study findings [<xref rid="pone.0279661.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The findings from this program will generate new knowledge on the effectiveness of school-based leadership programs on students’ leadership, FMS, classroom behaviour, well-being, muscular fitness, physical activity, executive functioning, and the relationship between these outcomes.</p>
