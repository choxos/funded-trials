                  <p id="Par2">This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled two-period two-treatment (melatonin and placebo) crossover study. Outpatients were recruited from Epworth and Austin Hospitals Melbourne, Australia. They had mild to severe TBI (<italic>n</italic> = 33) reporting sleep disturbances post-injury (mean age 37 years, standard deviation 11 years; 67% men). They were given prolonged-release melatonin formulation (2 mg; Circadin®) and placebo capsules for 4 weeks each in a counterbalanced fashion separated by a 48-hour washout period. Treatment was taken nightly 2 hours before bedtime. Serious adverse events and side-effects were monitored.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Melatonin supplementation significantly reduced global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores relative to placebo, indicating improved sleep quality [melatonin 7.68 vs. placebo 9.47, original score units; difference -1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), -2.70 to -0.88; <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001]. Melatonin had no effect on sleep onset latency (melatonin 1.37 vs. placebo 1.42, log units; difference -0.05; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.03; <italic>p</italic> = 0.23). With respect to the secondary outcomes, melatonin supplementation increased sleep efficiency on actigraphy, and vitality and mental health on the SF-36 v1 questionnaire (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 for each). Melatonin decreased anxiety on the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale and fatigue on the Fatigue Severity Scale (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 for both), but had no significant effect on daytime sleepiness on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (<italic>p</italic> = 0.15). No serious adverse events were reported.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">Sleep disturbances are commonly reported following traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring across the spectrum of severity and persisting years following injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Insomnia and hypersomnia are among the most prevalent sleep disorders in TBI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite a high prevalence, sleep disturbances are often overlooked in the TBI population and evidence-based treatments are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Consequently, untreated sleep disturbances following TBI contribute to ongoing cognitive dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], poorer rehabilitation outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], lower productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and poorer functional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">Although numerous mechanisms may contribute to sleep disturbance in TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], our research demonstrates that TBI is associated with attenuated and delayed melatonin profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Specifically, we observed reduced evening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and overnight melatonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] production in TBI patients compared to age and sex matched controls, with evening melatonin production positively correlated with REM sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As endogenous melatonin has sleep-promoting effects and is involved in the circadian control of the sleep–wake cycle, attenuated melatonin profiles may contribute to sleep-related disturbances following TBI. Thus, restoring melatonin with supplementation may help to alleviate sleep disturbances in individuals with TBI. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of melatonin supplementation (2 mg/d) on sleep quality in patients with TBI reporting sleep disturbances.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par20">A randomised placebo-controlled double-blind two-period two-treatment crossover phase III clinical trial was conducted. In light of the known heterogeneity between TBI patients and sleep disturbances in this population, the use of a crossover design minimised the influence of confounding covariates, such as injury-related characteristics and factors contributing to sleep disturbances, such as mood, anxiety and pain. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and it was approved by Monash University (CF11/1900-2011001061), Epworth HealthCare (52111) and Austin Health (H2013/04950) human research ethics committees. Participants gave informed consent before taking part. The clinical trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (12611000734965) in July 2011.</p>
                <p id="Par21">The study was conducted from August 2011 until November 2016, with the first patient enrolled on 9 April 2012. The 10-week study comprised a 2-week baseline run-in period followed by two treatment periods, during which participants received either melatonin or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a crossover with the alternative treatment for a further 4 weeks, separated by a 48-hour washout period. The washout period was chosen to minimise the carry-over of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and to provide time for medication turnaround and recharging of the Actiwatch.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par22">People with acquired brain injury from trauma (TBI) or stroke were eligible to participate in the study. However, as only three stroke patients completed treatment, this manuscript reports only on patients with TBI. Participants were community-dwelling adults, aged 18 to 65 years, who had sustained mild to severe TBI. We recruited participants from Epworth and Austin Hospitals via referrals from physicians and allied health professionals. TBI participants had a history of blunt head trauma with loss of consciousness, and initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3–14 and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). All participants had an identifiable sleep complaint corroborated by a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score ≥8, followed by a confirmed diagnosis of chronic insomnia according to the <italic>International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A global PSQI of 8 has been shown to have high specificity and sensitivity to a diagnosis of insomnia in patients with TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Participants were excluded if they self-reported sleep problems, fatigue or neurological conditions prior to TBI; were pregnant (screened with a blood test); had undertaken trans-meridian travel across more than one time zone or worked night shifts in the preceding three months; were deemed at a high risk of obstructive sleep apnoea by responses on the Berlin Questionnaire; reported consuming non-prescription sleep medication, benzodiazepines or hypnotics in the preceding 6 weeks; or used illicit or psychoactive substances in the previous 12 months. Participants’ urine was screened to rule out illicit substance use.

                <p id="Par24">The rationale for the study was based on self-reports from people with TBI who told us that sleep was a significant problem. This study involved a community-based sample, and no patients, caregivers or laypeople were involved in developing the research question or study design. Neither patients nor laypersons assisted with the conceptualisation of the study or outcome measures, the interpretation of the results or drafting the manuscript. Outcome measures were selected based on previous studies on sleep and TBI in light of their simplicity and high sensitivity and specificity. The burden of intervention on patients was not assessed, though researchers were cognisant of minimising patient burden by limiting the number of questionnaires at follow-up appointments. All follow-up appointments were arranged at the participant’s convenience and were limited to less than 1 hour. A summary of results will be disseminated to participants by way of a newsletter, and participants and their families will be encouraged to contact us with questions. Participants will be provided with resources to assist them with obtaining melatonin supplementation.</p>

                <p id="Par25">Participants were randomly allocated to a 4-week melatonin or placebo treatment before crossover to the remaining treatment. Pill containers were labelled with the participant’s code and featured instructions for directions as follows: Take one capsule orally at approximately the same time every night, within 2 hours of initiating sleep. To ensure compliance, participants received text messages nightly. Melatonin treatment comprised prolonged-release melatonin formula (2 mg, Circadin®, Sigma Pharmaceuticals Australia). Placebo treatment matched the melatonin treatment for appearance, consisting of mannitol (106 mg), acacia (11 mg) and pure icing sugar (106 mg), compounded by Slade Pharmacy (Melbourne, Australia). Both treatments were encapsulated in identical two-piece gelatin capsules and dispensed in identical 30-capsule containers. This preparation was selected in light of previous studies demonstrating efficacy in individuals with insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and was the only preparation available in Australia at that time. To monitor for adverse events, at the end of each period, participants were asked if they experienced any of a list of symptoms in the preceding period. If endorsed, symptoms were graded mild, moderate or severe.</p>

                  <p id="Par27">The primary outcomes were sleep quality measured by PSQI global scores, and sleep onset latency measured by wrist actigraphy (Actiwatch-2, Phillips Respironics, Bend, Oregon). The PSQI has 19 items assessing subjectively perceived sleep quality in the previous month, and has been used extensively in patients with TBI. Global scores combine subdomains of sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction, overall sleep quality and medication use. The score range is 0–21, with higher values indicating poorer sleep quality. The PSQI was completed at the end of baseline and following each treatment phase.</p>
                  <p id="Par28">Throughout the study, participants completed a sleep diary retrospectively upon waking to determine time of sleep onset, offset and sleep duration. This was used to corroborate actigraphy sleep variables. To facilitate compliance, participants were sent daily text messages in the morning asking them to complete their sleep diary. Actigraphy data were visually inspected to identify discrepancies between the actigraphy data and the sleep diary. When actigraphy suggested a bedtime or wake time differed by more than 60 minutes from the diary report, the actigraphy was first adjusted by 60 minutes and then by 30-minute blocks, in combination with activity and light amplitude, as used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Actigraphy amendments were undertaken prior to unblinding and verified by a second blinded researcher.</p>
                  <p id="Par29">Actigraphy sleep onset latency captures the time elapsed between the start of the rest interval relative to the sleep start time, expressed in minutes. Wrist actigraphy provides a valid measure of sleep–wake behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Participants were instructed to wear the Actiwatch on their non-dominant wrist each day and night, except when bathing or exercising. Actigraphy was collected in 1-minute epochs, downloaded and analysed using Actiware® software version 6.0.7 (Philips, Respironics). The sensitivity was set to medium (i.e., 40 activity counts during 1 minute was quantified as awake), as this setting is moderately correlated with polysomnography sleep variables in individuals with insomnia and has been used in the TBI population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Sleep onset latency was averaged during the baseline phase and across each treatment period.</p>

Daytime sleepiness and subjective fatigue were assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. The ESS was modified to assess daytime somnolence in the preceding 4 weeks. Self-reported anxiety and depressive symptomology were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Eight facets of self-reported health-related quality of life were evaluated by the short-form health survey (SF-36 v1). All self-report questionnaires were completed after baseline and following each treatment.</p>

For each participant, treatment conditions were assigned and sealed in opaque envelopes (M for melatonin first and P for placebo first) and provided to the dispensing pharmacist. Participant codes were allocated sequentially as participants enrolled, and treatments were prepared and allocated by a pharmacist not affiliated with the study. The pharmacist preparing the treatments did not interact with the researchers or participants, and treatments were collected by the research assistants. Participants received one container at the commencement of each treatment period. Participants, physicians and study researchers were blinded to medication allocation. Unblinding of treatment occurred after the final participant evaluation. Data were coded by one researcher to indicate which treatment was received first, and those data screened for outliers and missing data. Data were analysed by a separate researcher blinded to treatment allocation.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par43">The aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of melatonin in alleviating sleep disturbance in patients with TBI and insomnia. We found that melatonin improved subjective sleep quality and actigraphic sleep efficiency. Melatonin also reduced self-reported anxiety symptomatology and fatigue, whilst improving self-perceived vitality and mental functioning as assessed by the SF-36 v1 health survey. No improvement was observed for daytime sleepiness, depressive symptomatology or the six remaining SF-36 v1 domains. The present results, therefore, suggest that melatonin may be useful in treating sleep disturbances in patients with TBI.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Our study is limited by the following factors. Firstly, the sample recruited was smaller than intended. Due to the poor recruitment of stroke patients, we cannot determine whether melatonin can improve sleep following a stroke. Secondly, we did not determine endogenous melatonin concentrations and circadian phase in all participants. In a subset of TBI participants (<italic>n</italic> = 9), we demonstrated a 42% reduction in overnight salivary melatonin production (<italic>d</italic> = 0.87; <italic>p</italic> = .034) and delayed circadian phase (<italic>d</italic> = 1.23; <italic>p</italic> = .003) relative to age and-gender matched controls with similar sleep schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As melatonin concentrations and phase were not captured, we are unable to determine the extent to which changes in sleep quality were mitigated by alterations in circadian phase. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the efficacy of melatonin supplementation in TBI regardless of melatonin production and circadian phase, given that such information is not measured in the clinical setting. The current study was designed to exploit the sleep-promoting effects of melatonin, which have been previously characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], utilising a prolonged-release preparation that mimics the endogenous profile and targets sleep maintenance problems. Therefore, timing of treatment was selected to harness the sleep prompting effects, with time of administration consistent with directions for use as indicated by the manufacturer. Although additional information regarding endogenous melatonin profiles would have been useful, melatonin supplementation was found to be therapeutic. Phenotyping circadian phase (e.g., dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)) would be an important step for future studies by informing the treatment approach by targeting underlying circadian misalignment for maximal benefit. Furthermore, recent discussions regarding the therapeutic outcomes between short-acting vs. long-acting melatonin preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] suggest comparative studies are needed for evidence-based recommendations.</p>
              <p id="Par45">We implemented a 48-hour washout period between consecutive treatments. Although the terminal half-life for melatonin is relatively short (3.5–4 hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], it is possible that melatonin administered in the first treatment period could have induced a circadian phase advance, which could have persisted for up to several days in the following (placebo) treatment period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We confirmed that there were no treatment order effects across all outcome measures, and we limited most of the assessment treatment outcomes (except sleep diary and actigraphy) to the end of each treatment condition, when circadian phase would have re-established after melatonin treatment had ceased.</p>
              <p id="Par46">The rationale of using a crossover design over a parallel design was to minimise confounding covariates such as TBI characteristics and factors underpinning sleep disturbance, such as depression, anxiety and pain, which were inherently controlled by each participant serving as their own control. The implementation of a crossover design reduced the number of participants required, and it guaranteed all participants received the active treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par47">To our knowledge, only one other study has examined the therapeutic benefit of melatonin on sleep disturbance in TBI. Kemp and colleagues did not find any statistically significant benefits of melatonin on sleep latency, duration, quality or daytime alertness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, this study was limited to seven males and melatonin was compared to amitriptyline rather than a placebo. With a rigorous study design involving a placebo control and larger sample size, we found melatonin to be efficacious in improving sleep relative to a non-active control.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Previous clinical trials have shown melatonin’s sleep-promoting properties in patients with insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and tetraplegia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Trials that have utilised Circadin (2 mg), the melatonin formulation used in the current study, have shown that this melatonin preparation improves sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and sleep efficiency, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in people over the age of 55 with insomnia. A similar melatonin formulation has been shown to be effective in improving sleep quality in patients with tetraplegia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] for whom melatonin profiles are abolished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our study extends these findings by showing that a prolonged-release melatonin formation, Circadin, is efficacious in improving sleep quality and sleep efficiency in patients with TBI.</p>
              <p id="Par49">The current study found that melatonin improved subjective sleep quality. Such findings may be attributed to the sleep-promoting properties of melatonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The temporal association between the nocturnal rise in melatonin and increase in sleep propensity suggests that onset of nocturnal melatonin secretion facilitates the transition from wake to sleep by inhibiting the wake-alerting system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Melatonin may act as a sleep-promoting agent by attenuating wake-promoting signals from the suprachiasmatic nucleus, primarily via the melatonin MT1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Melatonin’s sleep-promoting properties may also be mediated by the hypothermic response based on the temporal and causal relationship between increases in endogenous melatonin concentrations and subsequent decline in core body temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It has also been hypothesised that melatonin may act as a muscle relaxant, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and this may explain the apparent impact of melatonin on anxiety symptoms in the present study. The anxiolytic properties of melatonin have been demonstrated in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and paediatric populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The improvement in sleep quality also appeared to have a flow-on effect to reduce the subjective impact of fatigue in daily life and improve vitality. Although no clinical global impression was obtained in the current study, a large majority of the outcome measures were based on self-reports by the participants and thus, the current findings are clinically meaningful because changes were perceived by the participants themselves.</p>
              <p id="Par50">The present study required participants to consume treatment approximately 2 hours prior to habitual bedtime and after their evening meal. These instructions are in line with previous studies utilising Circadin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and are based on the pharmacokinetic profile of Circadin (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> = 1.6 hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. As a large majority of participants consumed their treatment as prescribed, the translation of the current findings into clinical practice is dependent on appropriately timed melatonin administration.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Various pharmacological treatments exist for the management of sleep disturbance. Hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed to patients with TBI experiencing sleep disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Whereas benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines are equally effective in treating insomnia in patients with TBI over 7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], the efficacy and safety of long-term use in patients with TBI is unknown. Hypnotics are only indicated for short-term use and prolonged use can result in dependence, especially in vulnerable populations, such as patients with TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Conversely, the safety and tolerance profile of melatonin observed in the current study is consistent with previous studies in non-TBI populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, based on the current findings, melatonin affords TBI patients an alternative treatment to alleviate sleep disturbance with minimal side effects.</p>
              <p id="Par52">In the current study, melatonin had a moderate effect size for improving sleep quality (<italic>d =</italic> 0.46). This magnitude of improvement in sleep quality is double that of amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) relative to no treatment, when administered to patients with TBI over the same time period (<italic>d</italic> = 0.21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As melatonin was well tolerated in the current study, with no serious adverse events reported, melatonin offers clinicians an alternative treatment to that of conventional sleeping medications.</p>
              <p id="Par53">While melatonin was found to be effective in alleviating sleep disturbances, it is acknowledged that the mechanisms underpinning sleep disturbances in TBI involve multiple biological and psychological systems, such as alterations in monoaminergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and wake-promoting hypocretin-1 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and alterations in melatonin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], as well as pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and mood disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This suggests that while melatonin supplementation may alleviate sleep disturbance in individuals with TBI, melatonin is unlikely to address all sleep problems. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown efficacious in TBI populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Due to the multi-factorial nature of sleep disturbances following TBI, complementing melatonin supplementation with CBT-I may prove beneficial.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par54">This study provides preliminary evidence for the efficacy of melatonin in alleviating sleep dysfunction in patients with TBI and insomnia. Although melatonin was well tolerated and provides a safe alternative to traditional hypnotic medications in patients with TBI and insomnia, treatment efficacy is unknown over longer durations. Future research should investigate the role of combining melatonin supplementation with other treatments, such as CBT-I and light therapy, to determine improvements in sleep outcomes in TBI beyond that of melatonin alone.</p>
