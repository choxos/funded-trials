                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Adults with lower levels of health literacy are less likely to engage in health-promoting behaviours. Our trial evaluates the impacts and outcomes of a mobile health-enhanced preventive intervention in primary care for people who are overweight or obese.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A two-arm pragmatic practice-level cluster randomised trial will be conducted in 40 practices in low socioeconomic areas in Sydney and Adelaide, Australia. Forty patients aged 40–70 years with a body mass index ≥28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> will be enrolled per practice. The HeLP-general practitioner (GP) intervention includes a practice-level quality improvement intervention (medical record audit and feedback, staff training and practice facilitation visits) to support practices to implement the clinical intervention for patients. The clinical intervention involves a health check visit with a practice nurse based on the 5As framework (assess, advise, agree, assist and arrange), the use of a purpose-built patient-facing app, <italic>my snapp</italic>, and referral for telephone coaching. The primary outcomes are change in health literacy, lifestyle behaviours, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure. The study will also evaluate changes in quality of life and health service use to determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and examine the experiences of practices in implementing the programme.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The study has been approved by the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Human Research Ethics Committee (HC17474) and ratified by the University of Adelaide Human Research Ethics committee. There are no restrictions on publication, and findings of the study will be made available to the public via the Centre for Primary Health Care and Equity website and through conference presentations and research publications. Deidentified data and meta-data will be stored in a repository at UNSW and made available subject to ethics committee approval.</p>

                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>Reducing the burden of chronic disease is an important public health priority in Australia.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Overweight and obesity account for 7% of the burden of disease<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> as a risk factor for 11 types of cancer, 3 cardiovascular conditions, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, dementia, gallbladder disease, fatty liver, gout, back pain and osteoarthritis.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Currently, around 63% of the Australian population are overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more) and the prevalence is increasing.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The burden of overweight is unequally distributed with a 13% higher prevalence of overweight in the lowest compared with the highest socioeconomic group in women.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is an urgent need to find effective strategies at both the population and individual level to prevent and manage this condition.</p>
                <p>Low functional health literacy (ie, health-related reading and numeracy) is present in approximately 59% of the population and is more common in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It is a potential barrier to the uptake and effectiveness of a range of preventive interventions.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Aspects of health literacy have also been associated with poorer uptake of screening programmes and immunisation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Conversely, higher health literacy has been associated with greater improvements in response to physical activity interventions in disadvantaged populations.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Patients with low health literacy are less likely to engage in health-promoting behaviours,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> receive and understand preventive advice, and attend or complete programmes that they are referred to.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> A systematic review of interventions in primary care to improve health literacy for chronic disease behavioural risk factors found that interventions with multiple components were more effective at improving nutritional health literacy.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
                <p>Primary care is well positioned to contribute to the prevention and management of overweight and obesity. Over 86% of the population of Australia visit a general practitioner (GP) at least once a year.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Almost one-third of patients presenting in general practice are obese and two-thirds are overweight or obese, which are rates similar to the prevalence in the general community.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Behavioural interventions in primary care have been demonstrated to achieve a 5%–7% improvement in weight, blood pressure (BP) or lipids for patients, potentially preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> However, these interventions tend to have lower uptake by low socioeconomic groups<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> and, overall, most weight loss interventions in primary care achieve only small reductions in weight.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>

              <sec id="s1b">
                <title>Preliminary work leading up to this study</title>
                <p>Over the past decade we have sought to develop more effective interventions to prevent disease in primary care which target disadvantaged populations who are more likely to have low health literacy. In previous research we have found that ethnicity and language interact with health literacy to influence the uptake of preventive interventions especially those for weight loss.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This accords with the findings of others that health literacy differentials are greater among older people, for those born overseas, those who do not speak English at home and those with low educational attainment.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In these groups, patient–provider communication tends to be less effective, leading providers to incorrectly assume that patients with low health literacy are poorly motivated and they are therefore less likely to offer lifestyle interventions.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> Organisational and practitioner barriers also contribute to low frequency and effectiveness of assessment, advice, goal setting and referral of patients with low health literacy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 28</xref> These barriers include time available for consultations and competing demands on primary care staff.</p>
                <p>We have also identified a need to tailor prevention and management of excess weight to a patients’ level of health literacy.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Our review of primary healthcare level interventions targeting health literacy around weight loss found limited information as to the effect of weight loss interventions on health literacy primarily because this is an outcome not frequently reported.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We have evaluated a structured, nurse delivered health check intervention based on 5As that includes a brief assessment of health literacy, tailoring advice and the use of ‘teach-back’; goal setting that involves specific, time-bound goals that are set collaboratively and involve feedback; and assisted navigation to referral services and proactive follow-up visits.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30–33</xref> This has proven feasible to implement<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>; however, consistent with other studies, the impact on risk behaviours and weight have been small.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This may be due to the limited capacity within primary care to provide interventions based on evidence that are of sufficient intensity and length.</p>
                <p>We have concluded that there is a need to supplement weight management consultations in primary care with specific components that continue to operate outside the consultation such as coaching programmes and other support services. There is some evidence of barriers to uptake of these components such as cost and accessibility,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 35</xref> although the evidence for health coaching suggests it is an accessible, affordable and effective method to change health behaviours.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> Moreover, an evaluation of a government-funded telephone coaching service in New South Wales (NSW) suggested that it could be effective in reaching disadvantaged population groups.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Another promising approach is the use of eHealth to supplement both clinical care and referral programmes in supporting behavioural change. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of mobile health (m-health) text messages as part of a lifestyle programme to prevent unhealthy weight gain in young adults.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This adds to the emerging evidence of the efficacy of using mobile apps and SMS text messaging in supporting change in health behaviours.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, the optimal form and role of this technology for patients with low health or eHealth literacy is still unclear.</p>
                <p>This paper describes the protocol for the development and evaluation of an intervention which combines face-to-face consultation in general practice with these digital health approaches based on previous research which has demonstrated both feasibility of implementation and highlighted the potential for health gains.</p>

              <title>Intervention development</title>
              <p>The various components of the HeLP-GP intervention have been developed and piloted over the past 5 years.</p>
              <p>The brief primary care intervention which is designed to support practices to improve the quality of preventive care for the SNAP (smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity) risk behaviours and weight management is based on behavioural theory and is structured on the 5As framework which encompasses assessment, advice, agreeing on goals, assisting with motivational counselling and referral options and arranging follow-up.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 41</xref> Progress along the pathway from assessment to follow-up is associated with increased patient motivation and behavioural change.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> This has been trialled in general practice and found to be feasible and acceptable and to lead to improvement in the quality of preventive care.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 43 44</xref> This intervention was adapted for use by practice nurses (PNs) and modified for patients with low health literacy to include brief screening for low health literacy, tailored communication and referral navigation to local lifestyle programmes and piloted.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> It was subsequently evaluated in a trial which demonstrated its feasibility and acceptability to providers and patients.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
              <p>The app used in this study is supported by <italic>Healthy.me</italic>, a personally controlled health management platform designed to help patients and consumers manage their health.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> This has been shown to improve uptake of preventive services,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> and strong consumer acceptance has been demonstrated in Australia across different healthcare settings including primary care.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> This platform was modified to create the mobile application used in this study (<italic>my snapp</italic>). This was informed by research that interventions based on theory and those involving goal setting and self-monitoring as well as providing additional methods to interact with patients, particularly text messages, were more effective.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50–53</xref> Other research suggests that patients with low health literacy prefer apps or text messages to other sources of online information.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p>

                <title>Aims and research questions</title>
                <p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a preventive intervention in primary care structured around the 5As framework supported by a patient-facing mobile app, consultations with the PN and/or referral to a telephone coaching service. The intervention aims to develop the knowledge and skills of overweight or obese patients with low health literacy. The trial will assess the impact of the intervention on preventive care received, patients’ health and eHealth literacy, physical and behavioural risk factors, quality of life and costs.</p>

                  <p>Information on resource use associated with the intervention will be collected by research staff, including the cost of setting up the intervention: practice staff education, practice support visits and materials and web support. Other relevant resource use includes GP and PN visits, referrals, hospital attendances and prescribing. We will request patient consent to access their medical records, MBS and PBS data, and public hospital data from the state health departments. The MBS, PBS and state data will capture most primary care and hospital costs. The cost of PN visits for health checks will be assigned an hourly rate based on PN salary levels plus on-costs. Questions on patient use of lifestyle services and programmes, and non-Medicare funded allied health will also be included in the patient questionnaire. Cost estimates will be generated for referrals to community-based programmes. In the base case analysis, undertaken from a health service perspective, referrals to allied health professionals will only be costed if supported by a Medicare claim. The incremental costs of the intervention will be presented alongside the consequences with respect to changes in quality of life (including the estimation of quality-adjusted life year gains informed by the EQ5D-5L) and differences in health literacy, behavioural outcomes and clinical measures (BMI, BP and lipids). Deterministic and bootstrapped sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to identify key uncertain parameters and represent uncertainty around the mean estimates, respectively.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This trial evaluates a comprehensive intervention which is designed to support better preventive care for overweight and obese patients with low health literacy. It builds on previous work by the investigators and others to develop feasible interventions in primary care that address both patient and practice barriers to adoption, implementation and effectiveness. If successful, it will inform policy and practice including the role of primary care in addressing the challenge of overweight and obesity and the often-conflicting information that is available to practitioners and the public.</p>
              <p>The complexity of the intervention and evaluation poses potential threats to internal and external validity. Recruiting and engaging a large number of practices to a trial such as this is becoming increasingly difficult. We have addressed this by working in partnership with PHNs (district level organisations of general practice and allied health services) to identify, approach and brief practice principals and practitioners on the study. Practice costs will be reimbursed, and practitioners will be able to access continuing professional development points through the clinical audit and training. However, the main incentive is the value of the research itself and how it will inform policy and practice in the long run and this needs to be carefully discussed.</p>
              <p>Problems with recruitment, retention or engagement of patients with the intervention and data collection have the potential to reduce statistical power and therefore the ability to detect the primary outcomes with adequate precision. In this setting, recruitment procedures need to avoid pressure from the research team and patient’s own GP to ensure that eligible patients are approached and provided with sufficient information to make an informed decision about participation. We will work with practices to set up software and systems to make this possible. A significant part of the burden on participants will be from the telephone interviews by the research team. Although telephone interviews are preferred by most patients, they are onerous if they are too long. We have thus had to balance this burden against our desire to collect as much information as possible using robust instruments.</p>
              <p>A further risk is that the clinical intervention will not be implemented in practice as we planned. Again, addressing this requires close work with the practices. The implementation measures and qualitative evaluation will provide some insight, but this may be too late to correct. We have thus built into the practice level intervention several measures to improve fidelity. These include feedback mechanisms in the online training, reflective feedback from practices on the audits and practice discussion during the facilitation visits. These will be tracked regularly during the implementation of the trial. A further risk is that some health and eHealth literacy will both be required for adoption of the app by patients and is expected to improve as a result of the intervention use. This will be addressed by the support provided to patients by PNs and GPs.</p>
              <p>The fieldwork for the study is planned to be completed by mid 2019 with follow-up completed by late 2019. We anticipate circulation of the main findings from the study by 2020.</p>
