                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common childhood physical disability, with 80% estimated to be in low-middle-income countries. This study aims to (1) determine the accuracy of General Movements (GMs)/Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) for detecting CP at 18 months corrected age (CA); (2) determine the effectiveness of a community-based parent-delivered early intervention for infants at high risk of CP in West Bengal, India (Learning through Everyday Activities with Parents for infants with CP; LEAP-CP).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This study comprises two substudies: (1) a study of the predictive validity of the GMs and HINE for detecting CP; (2) randomised, double-blinded controlled trial of a novel intervention delivered through peer trainers (Community Disability Workers, CDW) compared with health advice (15 fortnightly visits). 142 infants at high risk of CP (â€˜absent fidgetyâ€™ GMs; â€˜high risk scoreâ€™ on HINE) aged 12â€“40â€‰weeks CA will be recruited to the intervention substudy, with infants randomised based on a computer-generated sequence. Researchers will be masked to group allocation, and caregivers and CDWs naÃ¯ve to intervention status. Visits will include therapeutic modules (goal-directed active motor/cognitive strategies and LEAP-CP games) and parent education. Health advice is based on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, WHO. Infants will be evaluated at baseline, post intervention and 18â€‰months CA. The primary hypothesis is that infants receiving LEAP-CP will have greater scaled scores on the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventoryâ€”Computer Adaptive Test (mobility domain) at 18 months compared with health advice. Secondary outcomes include infant functional motor, cognitive, visual and communication development; infant growth; maternal mental health.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>One in seven people globally has a disability, forming the worldâ€™s largest and most disadvantaged minority.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Cerebral palsy (CP) is among the most common childhood physical disabilities with epidemiological studies in low-middle-income countries (LMIC) estimating rates from 2.9 to 4.0 per 1000 live births,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> up to twice as common as estimates from high-income countries. With higher rates and larger populations, it is proposed that 80% of CP cases globally are in LMICs, where individuals and their families are frequently trapped in the negative downward cycle of disability and poverty.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Individuals with a disability and their families in LMIC have increased rates of premature mortality and associated morbidities and are economically disadvantaged by productivity loss, costs of interventions and equipment as well as consequences of social stigma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Significant gains have been made in the past decade in reducing infant mortality in LMIC.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> With a renewed global international development strategy pledged by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (2015â€“2030), it is pertinent to broaden attention from infant survival and to improved quality of life and developmental outcomes for children with a disability.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>In many LMICs, there is a shortage of specialised health workers to attend to the often larger populations and greater disease/disability rates.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 7</xref> A recent multisite early intervention study (spanning Africa and Asia) for infants with birth asphyxia advocated for the need to train non-professional individuals to address this workforce gap.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Lay health workers have been used as effective change agents across Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, to improve outcomes for both communicable and non-communicable diseases.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The current project aims to adapt this model for an early disability intervention for infants at risk of CP. The Indian National Rural Health Mission has been instrumental in establishing a community health worker programme to meet primary health needs in both urban and rural areas across the country (known as USHA/ASHA, Urban/Accredited Social Health Activists).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> West Bengal is an easterly state in India and with a population of 90â€‰million people is considered one of the most densely populated geographies in the world. These factors collectively make West Bengal an important location for piloting and implementing innovative interventions and service delivery models that are highly scalable and transposable for disability intervention in other LMICs.</p>
              <p>Recently published International Clinical Practice Guidelines advocate for CP detection from as young as 3 months using the General Movements (GMs) Assessment,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> and there is growing evidence to support the effectiveness of early cognitive and early active motor interventions in the first year of life for infants at high risk of CP.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Despite this state of science, many children in LMICs only receive their diagnosis at the age of school entry, missing a significant window of opportunity for improved outcomes.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Children with CP in these settings also face economic, geographical and social barriers to accessing medical and rehabilitation interventions.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 15 16</xref> In addition to the impact of disability on the child, there is strong evidence of higher prevalence of poor mental health in mothers of children with CP,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> for which there are demonstrated improvements consequent to early intervention for their child.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In order to impact on the social inclusion and workforce productivity of individuals with a disability in these contexts, it is essential to first establish innovative, accessible and feasible means to detect infants at risk of CP and subsequently develop early intervention programmes that are accessible for families of high-risk infants in these settings, are cost-effective and can be widely delivered. The GMs Assessment and Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) are two gold standard early detection tools based on systematic review, with demonstrated predictive validity for identifying later CP (GMs sensitivity: 95%â€“100%, specificity: 96%â€“98%; HINE sensitivity: 90%â€“96%, specificity: 85%â€“91%).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 19</xref> Both have simple administration (the GMs a 3â€‰min video taken on a smart phone, the HINE a truncated 26-item neurological examination) which we believe can be feasibly administered in the community context in LMIC and scored by expert certified raters.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A community-based intervention of active goal-directed strategies and environmental enrichment delivered peer to peer in the home also presents a viable solution for accessible and scalable intervention in this context. The aims of this study are twofold; to determine the predictive validity of a community-based early detection programme for infants at risk of CP in LMIC and to determine the effectiveness of a home-based peer delivered early intervention.</p>

CDWs are peer trainers from their local communities, with priority for employment given to mothers of a child with a disability. CDWs will coach the caregiver (or other significant people in the infantâ€™s life) on the goal or activity target at fortnightly home visits (forward and back loops).

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>This study was conceptualised directly from the authorâ€™s (KAB) engagement with children with CP and their families living in Bangladesh. Families were predominately rural-based from across all districts in Bangladesh and attending the Paediatric Unit at the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (Savar, Bangladesh). The service delivery model drew on both formal discussions regarding barriers restricting access to therapy for these families as well as informal observations of families attending direct centre-based therapy programmes. It also builds on findings from the distance learning package trial (NZK).</p>
                <p>The CDW employed as project staff are all mothers residing in the same communities as the participants. Four of these CDWs are mothers of a child with a disability, and one worker herself, a person with a disability. These women are all actively involved in the everyday recruitment and conduct of the study and represent the userâ€™s voice. An info-graphic summary of the key findings of the study will be developed at the conclusion of the study and distributed to participating families by their CDW.</p>

                <title>Outcomes and significance</title>
                <p>The proposed study is expected to result in a number of important outcomes spanning several tiers of society, including child, caregiver/family and health systems. Studies in LMIC have shown positive effects of early interventions for the general population and other high risk groups (eg, low birth weight) with significant improvements in childrenâ€™s cognition, language and social-emotional development. It is anticipated that the proposed intervention package, designed specifically for infants at risk of CP, will result in significant improvements in their language, cognition, mobility and activities of daily living. Consequently, these changes to childrenâ€™s developmental trajectories are likely to improve their participation in education, employment and community. By reducing the average age of CP detection to the first year of life, high-risk infants are expected to have greater improvements to brain development and motor/cognitive outcomes. The detection programme is also anticipated to better direct limited health resources to those that are at an increased risk of later diagnosis. Early interventions for infants with a disability have also been associated with reductions in maternal anxiety and depression.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In a country where women are often more socially isolated, which is further compounded by the stigma of having a child with a disability, such improvements in maternal mental health are expected to be significant for families and communities. By empowering mothers as disability resource champions in their local communities, the intervention is also expected to have a lasting and far-reaching benefit, beyond the duration of the study. South Asia has been at the heart of the Community Health Worker model development, which has been subsequently up-scaled around the globe. Building on this model, of up-skilling community members with varied levels of formal/technicalâ€‰education to deliver community-based healthcare, the proposed project is expected to result in a cost-effective and feasible model of care for infants with cerebral palsy that is highly scalable and transposable to other LMICs.</p>

              <p>This study is registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (12616000653460â€‰p). A two-stage consent process will be adopted for this study; caregivers will first provide informed consent for the eligibility assessment (detection substudy), and subsequently, those who are eligible for the intervention (â€˜high risk of CPâ€™) will then provide informed consent for the clinical trial (intervention substudy). Participant data will be stored and managed according to universal privacy and confidentiality standards. There are no known risks associated with the interventions, and both interventions (LEAP-CP and health advice) are anticipated to provide benefit to the infant and their family. Findings from this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and at national and international conference presentations.</p>

              <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
              <p>This study is an adequately powered randomised double-blinded controlled trial of a novel parent-delivered early intervention for infants at risk of CP in LMICs. Eligibility has been determined with gold standard tools (the GMs and HINE), according to an International Clinical Practice Guideline,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> to ensure infants who are likely to have a later diagnosis of CP are targeted. Outcomes are evaluated with standardised measures and evaluate a range of infant and family domains, including functional motor, cognitive, visual and communication developmental outcomes, infant growth and maternal mental health.</p>
              <p>As far as possible, this study adheres to guidelines for the conduct of an RCT and is expected provide valid results to test the stated hypotheses. However, this is a pragmatic RCT performed in a vulnerable population and as such certain confounders are present which should be considered when interpreting the findings. All children, regardless of study arm, are able to access care as usual in their community, which may dilute or influence the findings. To control for this, fortnightly recording of the infantâ€™s access to concurrent therapies is completed. Furthermore, as children in LMIC may have limited access to care as usual, it was considered necessary to provide nutrition and health support to all families in the study (with equivalent service delivery model and frequency for both study arms). This additional service provided to the standard care arm beyond â€˜standard careâ€™ may reduce the magnitude (or presence) of an effect between groups. Being a novel multidomain study, it is expected that the LEAP-CP intervention may impact on a range of infant and parent outcomes. While the motor domain on the PEDI-CAT was selected as the most meaningful primary infant outcome, gains on the many secondary outcomes will be considered valid in demonstrating the effectiveness of the intervention. At the conclusion of this study, it is expected that the effectiveness of the LEAP-CP programme will be determined, and as such, provide clinicians working in LMIC with the necessary information to inform the optimal management of infants with CP in LMIC.</p>
