                  <p>This study will evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a new intervention programme called <italic>teach-test-link-trace</italic> (TTLT) model in Tigrai, Ethiopia, where peer educators counsel about HIV (<italic>teach</italic>), perform house-to-house HIV testing (<italic>test</italic>) through pinprick HIV testing (H2H) or OraQuick HIV self-testing (HIVST), link HIV-positive patients to HIV care (<italic>link</italic>) and trace lost patients house-to-house (<italic>trace</italic>).</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The four-arm cluster randomised trial will be conducted in five phases: <italic>Phase 1</italic> will assess the acceptability of the TTLT model using a cross-sectional survey among adults aged 18 years irrespective of HIV status in 6909 households from 40 villages (kebeles). <italic>Phase 2</italic> will assess effectiveness of the TTLT model through comparing intervention and control groups among HIV negative or unknown HIV status. The intervention groups will receive one of the three home-based interventions provided by peer educators: (1) demonstrate and distribute OraQuick HIV self-testing kits (HIVST), (2) perform pinprick HIV testing (H2H) and (3) offer a choice to either receive HIVST or H2H. The control group will receive the standard care in which nurses counsel and refer eligible household members to nearby health facilities to access existing HIV testing services. The primary outcomes of the interventions are proportion of individuals who know of their HIV status (first 90), link to HIV care and treatment (second 90) and meet virological suppression (third 90). We will perform process evaluation through qualitative interviews in <italic>phase 3</italic>, economic evaluation for cost-effectiveness analysis in <italic>phase 4</italic> and a sustainability exit strategy using nominal group technique in <italic>phase 5</italic>. We will apply descriptive and inferential statistics for quantitative studies, and thematic framework analysis for qualitative studies.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Ethiopia is one of the sub-Sahara African countries that is disproportionally affected.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The most recent data inform that the HIV prevalence in Ethiopia was between 0.1% and 4.8% in 2017/2018.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In 2016, there were an estimated 36 990 new HIV infections, 670 906 people living with HIV and 20 000 AIDS-related deaths.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>To halt this epidemic, Ethiopia, like other countries, subscribed to the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets, a programme that was launched in Melbourne, Australia, in 2014.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The targets aimed at diagnosing 90% of people living with HIV (UNAIDS first 90), providing 90% of those diagnosed with antiretroviral therapy (ART) (UNAIDS first 90) and achieving viral suppression for 90% of patients receiving treatment (UNAIDS first 90) by 2020. Given most countries, including Ethiopia,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> fail to meet the target by 2020, the fast track targets are extended to UNAIDS 95-95-95 to be attained in 2030.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> To meet the targets for Ethiopia, this study aims to test a new and comprehensive intervention programme, never been implemented in Ethiopia before, called the <italic>teach-test-link-trace</italic> (TTLT) model. The TTLT model involves HIV-positive volunteer patients (peer educators) who do HIV counselling (<italic>teach</italic>), perform home-based HIV testing (<italic>test</italic>) through HIV self-testing (HIVST) and pinprick house-to-house HIV testing (H2H), link HIV-positive patients to HIV care (<italic>link</italic>) and trace lost patients house-to-house (<italic>trace</italic>). In the Ethiopian setting, peer educators are trained HIV-positive individuals who publicly disclose their HIV status.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Although not extensively explored, global evidence shows that peer educators make a substantial contribution to HIV testing uptake. For example, studies in Africa such as Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique have shown that the peer educators and/or community health workers have brought significant improvements to the achievements of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Additionally, a study in Zimbabwe assessed the impact of peer educators on improving HIV testing uptake through HIVST and was found effective.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Evidence from Uganda and Zambia showed that individuals accept and prefer HIVST than the routine facility-based HIV testing.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A systematic review in low-income and middle-income countries found that home-based HIV testing was found to increase HIV testing uptake.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>It has to be acknowledged that the impact of peer educators is beyond HIV testing, as they have also shown to improve the treatment linkage. For example, in Vietnam, a pilot study found that peer educators significantly helped people to know their HIV status and start on treatment for those diagnosed with HIV.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This pilot study in Can Tho, Vietnam, reported that 2520 people were tested, 140 (5.6%) were found to be HIV positive and 131 (93.6%) of those who were diagnosed with HIV started the treatment. Evidence also revealed that the peer-led HIV care services were reported to be cost-effective and comprehensive intervention.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>There has not been, however, a study that assessed the effectiveness of peer-led HIV testing through the novel testing strategies, HIVST and H2H, and their impact on improving the treatment linkage and virological suppression in Ethiopia. The study aims to test whether peer educators-led delivery of H2H and HIVST approaches in Tigrai, Northern Ethiopia, can increase the proportion of people who know their HIV status, link to treatment and achieve virological suppression. The trial also aims to assess a number of important safety endpoints including HIV-related stigma, and the cost-effectiveness and sustainability exit strategy of the new programme.</p>

The administrative system in Ethiopia has a hierarchical structure including the top most, the federal level, to the most bottom, the kebele (village) level. The organisational structure and health systems tier of Ethiopia is described in the Ethiopian Health Sector Development Programme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> From the regional level where this study will take place, the administrative system structure comprises regional state, zones, woreda (districts) and kebele.</p>

                <p>Tigrai is a regional state with 7 zones, 80 districts and 799 kebeles. A kebele is the lowest administrative unit with an average of 5000 people (1000 households). Served by two community health workers, the health post is the lowest health institutional structure in the rural areas and serves a kebele with an average of 5000 people. Five kebeles (five health posts) form a health centre and the health centre caters for total population of 15 000 to 25 000 people (average of 5000 households). The health centre plays a significant role in coordinating the five health posts in the rural areas. Unlike the rural setting, urban health centre serves up to 40 000 people. Tigrai has 39 public hospitals (2 specialised hospitals, 15 general hospitals and 22 primary hospitals), 216 health centres, 500 private health facilities (hospital, clinic and medical centres) and 712 health posts.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Every household in the kebele has a family folder in their health post catchment area, describing the basic demographic characteristics of the household members.</p>
                <p>The prevalence of HIV in Tigrai in 2017/2018 was 1.2%, a proportion higher than the national average (0.9%).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The prevalence of HIV in Tigrai is higher among women (vs men), urban (vs rural) and commercial sex workers (vs the general population). For example, the prevalence of HIV among women and men was 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There are 147 health facilities providing HIV testing and treatment services in Tigrai. Recently, 13 health facilities started to provide an oral HIV self-testing service. Each health facility providing HIV care and treatment services in Tigrai has one to five peer educators, who are trained and conduct counselling for non-compliant people diagnosed with HIV. The trial will be conducted in 40 kebeles and 8 health centres, randomly selected from all 7 zones in Tigrai (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). The Tigrai capital, Mekelle, with a total population of 310 436, will be the study headquarters to coordinate all sites.</p>

                <p>The principal aim of this study is to (1) assess the acceptability and feasibility of the TTLT model; (2) test TTLT model’s clinical and cost-effectiveness of HIV diagnosis, ART linkage and virological suppression; and (3) design a sustainable exit strategy of the programme. In addition, the trial also aims to assess: (4) quality of life of HIV patients and (5) HIV-related stigma.</p>

Finally, we take the sample of 5440 households, the maximum sample size, to improve the inference. Multistage sampling technique will be applied, and design effect is needed to increase the precision. We calculated DEFF (design effect) using the following formula:</p>

Prior to randomisation, we will organise a randomisation ceremony and invite local governments, community leaders, community health extension workers and members of the local data monitoring committee (DMC), and this process enhances recruitment strategies and aimed at ensuring the blinding of the participants. The kebeles will be randomly assigned to one of the four study groups. Households will be the intervention recipients and all eligible individuals in the households will be included in the analysis.</p>
                <p>To enhance allocation concealment, the peer educators and household participants will not be told the hypothesis of the research question so that to they are blinded to knowledge of the other interventions being conducted.

The research assistant checks if a household has at least one adult person aged 18 years old and consider eligible for inclusion. Eligible households will then be selected from each kebele using computer-generated random numbers. The research assistant will also recruit peer educators from each health centre located in selected clusters. To be included in the intervention, peer educators will need to: (1) be literate (primary school and above) because they will interview participants using structured questionnaire; and (2) willing to attend a 2-day training. Peer educators will be excluded if they: (1) do not want to disclose their HIV status during the HIV counselling and testing process, (2) are not fit to conduct home-to-home visit and (3) are not willing to participate in the trial.</p>
                <p>A list of the houses of those kebeles assigned to either HIVST, H2H or HIVST/H2H will be provided to peer educators, and a list of households of kebeles assigned to standard care will be provided to nurses. The peer educators or nurses will go to the kebeles and select one person from each of the selected households who fulfil the following inclusion criteria: aged 18 years and above at enrolment, do not know their HIV status or self-report HIV-negative within 3 months before enrolment, able to provide written informed consent, and willing to participate in the assessment at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months if positive for HIV when tested. This process will be continued until an eligible person is recruited. A person who is not willing, not able to answer to interview questions or seriously sick will be excluded from the study.</p>

HIV testing will be performed using finger-prick diagnostic tests using the national HIV testing algorithm. In this study group, nurses will visit a household once to counsel participants, distribute condom and refer them to standard HIV testing and care clinics to a nearest (or their preferred) health facility. The information about HIV counselling provided by the nurses to participants under the standard care group will be similar to that provided by the peer educators to participants under the three study intervention groups. Each participant will be provided a coded coupon so that their HIV status, clinical, immunological and virological characteristics at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months (if HIV positive and/or linked to HIV care) can be extracted. We have included nurses in the SOC, as opposed to peer educators. This is to assess the cost-effectiveness of peer educators versus trained health professionals (ie, nurses). Furthermore, nurses in Ethiopian healthcare system perform out of health facility HIV testing routinely to maximise HIV testing coverage and improve detection rate especially in camping periods.</p>

The package kit will contain OraQuick, instructions translated into Tigrigna (local language) and contact address of the peer educator. The written instructions will demonstrate a step-by-step guide on how to use and interpret the results, and are presented by pictures.

Peer educators will finally be needed to inform each participant to report to nearby (or their preference) health centre to confirm the HIV status if the result is reactive, and return the HIVST package and coded coupon even if the result is non-reactive. Alternatively, they can contact the peer educators through contact address included in the package should they do not want to go to the health facility.

                  <p>In all three interventions, the HIV status of participants will be known through HIVST or H2H. This is a diagnosis period where the first outcome, the first UNAIDS 90, will be measured.

If a participant does not want to disclose their HIV status to a (particular) peer educator, the participant will be given alternative option such as visiting another peer educator or HIV care provider over the study period.</p>
                  <p>The participants who are diagnosed with HIV will report (the HIVST group) or be referred (H2H) to HIV care services for ART initiation.

                  <p>We will describe the sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants by study arms and compare them using t-test and χ<sup>2</sup> tests to check for any imbalance between arms. Treatment effects will be assess using intention-to-treat analysis with multilevel models. Multiple imputation will be performed if there is more than 10% data missing. The analysis approach will account for the clustering of individuals within kebeles with both an unadjusted and adjusted analysis to account for residual confounding. We will also compare complete case analysis results with imputed missing data as a sensitivity analysis. Analysis will be performed before unblinding the data.</p>

                <title>Application of the Theory of Change in TTLT model</title>
                <p>The TTLT trial will be guided by the Theory of Change (ToC).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> ToC, originally incepted by Connel Weiss,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> articulates the change in impact of an intervention through intermediate and long-term outcomes through a complex causal pathway under certain conditions or assumptions.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> ToC has the following components: impact, long-term outcomes, intermediate outcomes, interventions, rationale, assumptions and indicators. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> outlines these components in the context of the current study’s model. Guided by the theory of change, we theorise that peer-led H2H or HIVST would lead to improved knowledge of HIV status by lessening the barriers to HIV testing. For example, the HIVST may reduce perceived or enacted HIV-related stigma from the community or from the health workers as it allows people to test themselves in a private place, leading to improved uptake of HIV testing, reduce time to linkage to HIV care and improved clinical and immunological outcomes. Similar analogy also works for the impact of H2H in knowledge of HIV status, linkage to care, and clinical and immunological outcomes. Nevertheless, there is also a possibility that the HIVST or H2H could not be successful, if people are still concerned that others (or family members in case of H2H) may discover about their HIV status.</p>

                <p>This trial will be led by the <italic>Tigrai-Flinders</italic> HIV research group comprising researcher from Flinders University in Australia and Mekelle University in Tigrai, Northern Ethiopia. The <italic>Tigrai-Flinders HIV Research Programme</italic> is a 5-year Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)-funded project and aims to improve the entire HIV care continuum programme through peer educators and community health workers in Tigrai. Additionally, we will establish a monitoring and evaluation committee comprising an independent DMC to oversee the data collection processes in the study settings (local DMC), and an evaluation committee that will independently evaluate the overall progress of the project (international DMC). The local DMC members will comprise experts from Tigrai in HIV from zonal health department and district health office, HIV patients from people living with HIV (PLWHA) associations, researchers from Tigrai Research Institute, HIV programme managers from Tigrai Regional Health Bureau, leaders from community and board members from institutional review board of Mekelle University. The international DMC will be made up of experts from Ethiopian Ministry of Health, Ethiopian Public Health Institute, international non-governmental organisations working in Tigrai, WHO and UNAIDS. This committee will monitor the overall progress of the trial—the implementation of the trial against the protocol, the importance to continue or stop the trial, overall quality of the intervention and success of the sustainability exit strategy.</p>
                <p>For trial monitoring, the research team will report field work progress for review to the local DMC. Any issues or concerns related to adverse events as a result of the interventions will be reported as they happen and the local DMC will review these reports and take necessary measures, including enabling participants who may report adverse event have 24 hours access to counselling services. The <italic>Tigrai-Flinders</italic> Research group and the local DCM will meet monthly, and once every 6 months with the international DMC. We acknowledge that some trials with long duration of interventions may need interim analysis to assess progress and determine whether they should continue or not. However, as this is a short duration trial, formal statistical stopping rules have not been planned.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The success of HIV testing, UNAIDS’s first 90, is the key for the success of the treatment linkage, retention in care and virological suppression, UNAIDS’s second and third 90. The introduction of HIVST and H2H (through peer educators) is a novel intervention programme to achieve the HIV diagnosis target for the following reasons: (1) self-testing and home-based HIV testing reduce HIV related stigma, a key barrier to the entire HIV care continuum,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 29</xref> as both services allow for the highest degree of privacy; (2) both services avoid structural barriers to HIV testing services such as distance, transportation fee and waiting times<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; and (3) the involvement of peer educators increase trust to HIV care system because they can share their lived experiences of HIV testing, treatment linkage and its benefit, and retention in care.</p>
              <p>The TTLT model is an alternative intervention that combines community-based and facility-based services. The overall goal of the intervention is to contribute to ending AIDS epidemic by 2030 through improving the HIV testing and diagnosis, treatment linkage, and clinical, immunological and virological outcomes. Working with the Tigrai Regional Health Bureau, Tigrai, Ethiopia and NHMRC, Australia, the trial is designed to answer the following questions: (1) Is home-based peer-led HIV self-testing and immediate HIV testing <italic>acceptable</italic>? (2) Is home-based peer-led HIV self-testing and immediate HIV testing <italic>effective</italic>? And (3) Is home-based peer-led HIV self-testing and immediate HIV testing improve <italic>ART linkage and virological suppression</italic>?</p>
              <p>The first research question will be addressed through a cross-sectional survey to measure acceptability of intervention. By assessing the acceptability of the model, we will be able to know how many people who accepted the intervention will be tested, and willing to remain in the peer-led HIV care and treatment. Furthermore, as we will ask 3 months’ HIV testing history, we will be able to measure the baseline data of the proportion of people who know their HIV status. This finding will be compared with after intervention findings which will be known by answering the second research question. The second research question will be addressed through providing the HIVST and/or H2H interventions. In these interventions, we will assess whether these interventions improve testing uptake or not. Coupled with qualitative exploration of experiences on service uptake with individuals in the trial and the cost-effectiveness analysis, we will measure a robust evidence on the effectiveness of the model.</p>
              <p>Although acceptability (question 1) and testing uptake (question 2) are an important piece of evidence for HIV testing policy, the design of this study allows for participants to be linked to nearby (or their preferred) health facilities for confirmatory test. Additionally, participants will be linked to ART care with the help of peer educators and will follow them to remain in the care. This will help us to answer question 3. In answering questions 2 and 3, we will assess the impact of the peer-led services to the entire HIV care continuum and this subsequently contributes to the ultimate goal of the UNAIDS goal, virological suppression and ending the AIDS epidemic.</p>
              <p>The fact that this study begins with community-based as opposed to facility-based is a major strength of the trial. The cluster randomised trial nature of the study allows to extrapolate the population benefit of the trial. The community-based HIVST and H2H interventions will allow individuals who never sought care to link to care, a novel gateway to improve the knowledge of HIV status.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Such early diagnosis will improve the benefit and effectiveness of ART. The HIVST and H2H programmes can also be integrated with contact tracing, one of the public health measures related to COVID-19, which will be another opportunity to support the already compromised facility-based HIV testing services as a result of the COVID-19-related restrictions.</p>
              <p>The study may have the following limitations. First, there may be a partner violence should their partner found out the self-testing in general and HIV positive result in particular. To address this, we will: (1) explain to the study participants before the start of the intervention, (2) inform them to report to us (or other responsible body) should any associated violence happen, and (3) inform them the availability of a 24-hour counselling through telephone or in person. Second, there may be safety concerns of stress, anxiety or self-harm associated with knowing the positive HIV status, a possible consequence which could also be happening in the standard HIV testing services. As we have described elsewhere in the document, the UNAIDS found no evidence of these issues associated with self-testing or home-based HIV testing.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In addition to counselling, participants will be informed to contact peer educators or call to nearby health facilities any time. Third, the clusters are small and the randomisation process will not be adequate to reduce the sampling bias. To minimise this, we stratified the clusters by zones at the design stage.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, it is expected that the project will have a substantial contribution to early HIV care presentation, retention in care and the virological suppression. We expect that findings of this project will produce knowledge, build capacity and inform policy and practice.</p>

              <p>Ethics approval (EC00188) was obtained from the Southern Adelaide Clinical Health Research Ethics Committee of South Australia. We will receive permissions from respective institutions and written consents from the participants prior to interview and testing. Participants will be informed to withdraw at any stage of the trial should they will not be willing to continue. The research project has a direct benefit for the study participants as every participant will know their HIV status and will be linked to care, if diagnosed with HIV. Although none was reported by UNAIDS, there may be minimal risks or adverse events during the HIVST/H2H process, such as emotional disturbance, self-harm, violence or feel burden due to their involvement. If participants feel any negative concern related to the study, the following measures will be taken: (1) participants will be informed to discontinue the study at any level should they feel uncomfortable; and (2) participants will be provided a contact address of the peer educator and referred to a counselling service within the respective health facilities. For the NGT participants, we will seek written consent from participants prior to recording the discussion. We will also assure all panellists that their information will be treated with the strictest confidence and no identifying background information will be published. In order to disseminate findings of the project, we will publish them in peer-reviewed journals, present on workshops and conferences, and share through a media release.</p>
