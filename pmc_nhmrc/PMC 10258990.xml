                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par32">Few randomised controlled trials specifically focus on prevention in rural populations. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) contributes to approximately one quarter of deaths in Australia. Nutrition is a key component affecting many risk factors associated with CVD, including hypercholesterolaemia. However, access to medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is limited for people living in rural areas, potentially exacerbating inequities related to health outcomes. Telehealth services present an opportunity to improve MNT access and address healthcare disparities for rural populations. The present study aims to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of a telehealth MNT CVD intervention program in lowering CVD risk over 12-months in regional and rural primary health care settings.</p>

                  <p id="Par33">A cluster randomised controlled trial set in rural and regional general practices in NSW, Australia, and their consenting patients (n = 300 participants). Practices will be randomised to either control (usual care from their General Practitioner (GP) + low level individualised dietetic feedback) or intervention groups (usual care from their GP + low level individualised dietetic feedback + telehealth MNT intervention). Telehealth consultations will be delivered by an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD), with each intervention participant scheduled to receive five consultations over a 6-month period. System-generated generic personalised nutrition feedback reports are provided based on completion of the Australian Eating Survey – Heart version (AES-Heart), a food frequency questionnaire. Eligible participants must be assessed by their GP as at moderate (≥ 10%) to high (&gt; 15%) risk of a CVD event within the next five years using the CVD Check calculator and reside in a regional or rural area within the Hunter New England Central Coast Primary Health Network (HNECC PHN) to be eligible for inclusion. Outcome measures are assessed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is reduction in total serum cholesterol. Evaluation of the intervention feasibility, acceptability and cost-effective will incorporate quantitative, economic and qualitative methodologies.</p>

                  <p id="Par34">Research outcomes will provide knowledge on effectiveness of MNT provision in reducing serum cholesterol, and feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of delivering MNT via telehealth to address CVD risk in rural regions. Results will inform translation to health policy and practice for improving access to clinical care in rural Australia.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par36">A person’s choice to live in a rural or metropolitan area can affect their cardiovascular health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The reasons for this are multifactorial and comprise a range of environmental and societal factors including availability and access to appropriate services and healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At a personal level, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular health in rural residents may include sex, age, Indigenous status, socioeconomic status, education, health literacy, physical activity, access to healthy foods and food insecurity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">A meta-analysis of international published data has shown that cardiovascular disease (CVD) related lipids are worse in urban populations compared to rural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, in Australia, it has been shown that if modifiable risk factors for CVD in rural populations were equal to those in metropolitan areas, the attributable death rate would be reduced by 38% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These modifiable risk factors include diet, alcohol, smoking behaviours, physical activity and body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. While rural Australian populations have been reported to have higher vegetable intakes, other risk factors, such as prevalence of smoking, alcohol consumption, saturated fat and total energy intakes are significantly higher compared to urban counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">Whilst there is a need to privilege preventative medicine addressing CVD risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], there is little published research specific to rural communities to guide practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Specifically, there is limited evidence of improvement in dietary intake patterns secondary to nutrition interventions in the context of CVD prevention and management within rural communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, only a small proportion of research funding is dedicated to rural research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Existing research has uncovered many challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], differences and similarities in risk factors stratified by location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and some information on service delivery models for chronic health outcomes in rural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par39">Improving nutritional intake is a prevention strategy that can affect multiple risk factors for the development of CVD, thus The National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance Absolute Risk Guidelines recommend dietary intervention for CVD prevention and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There is also evidence that individuals are more likely to improve their dietary patterns if they receive personalised nutrition assessment and feedback, and regular, ongoing support from an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, dietitians have rarely been used in either the development or delivery of nutrition interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and translation techniques are not adequately described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, access to APDs in rural and regional areas who are trained to provide medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is challenging. Barriers include remote location of patients, long travel times, long waiting lists, consultation costs, reimbursable care plan restrictions, inadequate referral pathways, and fewer service providers.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Clinicians and patients need access to MNT tools that are fit for purpose, valid and engaging. This includes detailed assessment of usual dietary patterns, and identifying aspects related to CVD. Many, including the general population and people working in the healthcare system, are unaware that improved access to APD services can improve diet related health and patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The result is regional and rural patients’ risk factors remain unchanged or worsen, while reliance on medications, healthcare burden and mortality risk escalate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par41">The current study is a parallel group 12-month cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compares provision of two levels of dietary advice within a rural primary care setting. Primary care practices are randomised such that patients in the first group will receive usual care as provided by their General Practitioner (GP), with the addition of a dietary assessment via a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which includes an individualised automated feedback report on usual eating patterns. The second group will also receive individualised feedback from the FFQ, and an additional five telehealth MNT consultations over a six-month period with an APD.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The aim of this trial will be to reduce serum lipids associated with CVD health. The secondary aim will be to reduce modifiable risk factors related to CVD health, such as blood pressure, anthropometry and improve dietary patterns based on the proportion of total energy contributed by foods from food groups that are energy-dense, nutrient-poor and also those that are nutrient-dense.</p>

                <title>Study settings</title>
                <p id="Par44">The trial is set in primary care practices, in rural or remote areas covered by the Hunter New England Central Coast Primary Health Network (HNECC PHN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Rural location is defined here using the Modified Monash Model (MMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. MMM categorises an area as city (MM 1), regional (MM 2), rural (MM 3–5) or remote (MM 6–7). Areas included in this trial are categorised as MM3 or higher, ranging from towns with 15,000–50,000 people, to very remote locations.</p>

                <p id="Par50">1. General practices / General Practitioners (GPs). General practices or GPs that are based within the HNECC PHN footprint and that are categorised within MM 3–6 are eligible to be recruited. Practices must also have a Pen CS Clinical Audit Tool (PENCAT) agreement with the Primary Health Network. PENCAT is a clinical audit tool, available to Australia’s primary care practices through the PHN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The PENCAT Plus clinical suite can be used by Best Practice or Medical Director practice management software. The practice must operate at least one day per week in the rural area identified to be eligible for registration. At the time of project development (9th Feb 2021), 76.8% of practices in the target group were using PENCAT software. General Practices and GPs who consent to the study must agree to providing usual care to any of their study participants for the 12 months they are involved in the study.</p>

Additionally, all participants in the study are invited to complete the AES-Heart at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months. The AES Heart is an online 242 question Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), that asks about usual consumption in the last 3–6 months. The AES-Heart is based on the Australian Eating Survey (AES), with additional questions added relating to foods significant to heart health. Both the AES and AES-Heart are validated for usual intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Upon completion of the FFQ, the user is given immediate visual and written feedback that compares their nutritional intake to national dietary and heart health guidelines.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par132">This cluster randomised controlled trial aims to use referral pathways in primary care to determine whether serum cholesterol can be improved following an addition of telehealth MNT to usual care in rural NSW in those at increased risk of heart disease. Limited evidence from high-quality nutrition interventions among rural communities addressing CVD risk exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hence, the current trial will address this gap and add to the evidence base. It is expected that the series of personalised telehealth appointments with qualified APDs who have received additional training, will facilitate a decrease serum cholesterol among participants, and the therapeutic APD-participant interaction will aid long-term nutrition-related heart health behaviour change. Previous research in a small sample using a similar method of APD consultation found that diet quality could be improved, and total energy derived from energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods reduced by approximately 7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par133">There are several practical and logistical concerns to be addressed. These include that participation in cardiovascular clinical trials has historically been low for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. More importantly, the demand for GPs in Australia is currently increasing, and a shortfall has occurred, with reduced access particularly impacting people living in rural and remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A large research project conducted prior to the COVID19 pandemic with similar recruiting strategies indicated that the median number of participants randomised per GP was three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This means that the current study will need to provide a high level of support to GPs to achieve the commitment necessary. Engaging practices and GPs and reaching the desired sample size in a time of high demand, e.g., in case of a severe flu season, is therefore likely to be challenging. One of the unintended consequences of implementing this project following a pandemic may be that lessons are learned regarding recruitment of rural GPs and their practice staff into research, during a period with complex time and resource pressures.</p>
              <p id="Par134">In addition, barriers to telehealth utilisation exist, particularly in rural areas and include both cultural and technological issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Previous research in the target region has shown that telehealth may be perceived as a lower level of care, or replacement of services by healthcare practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Additionally, those who had already used telehealth services reported technological barriers that diminished the quality of interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, recent evidence from other research studies providing allied health services to rural populations via telehealth indicated that overall experiences were positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>

              <p id="Par135">This rural telehealth project investigates the feasibility and efficacy of person-centred dietetic consultations, specifically designed for non-metropolitan areas of NSW. Insights from this project are likely to be applicable to other rural regions, and will emphasise that local context, knowledge and relationships are highly important when seeking to conduct nutrition-related telehealth research in rural areas of Australia.</p>
