                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Twenty healthy young adults (18–45 y of age) underwent a blinded randomized crossover dietary intervention, consuming a high-SCFA diet and a matched low-SCFA diet for 21-d with a 21-d washout in between. SCFAs were provided through resistant starch, inulin, and apple cider vinegar. Blood and 3-d total fecal output were collected at baseline and at the end of each diet. GC was used to measure fecal and plasma SCFA. Flow cytometry was used for peripheral blood immunophenotyping.</p>

                  <p>According to a paired samples Wilcoxon test, the high-SCFA diet was associated with significantly higher fecal SCFA concentrations [median (IQR); 86.6 (59.0) compared with 75.4 (56.2) µmol/g, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02] and lower fecal ammonia concentrations [26.2 (14.7) compared with 33.4 (18.5) µmol/g, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.04] than the low-SCFA diet. Plasma propionate [9.87 (12.3) compared with 4.72 (7.6) µmol/L, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.049] and butyrate [2.85 (1.35) compared with 2.02 (1.29) µmol/L, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03] were significantly higher after the high-SCFA diet than after the low-SCFA diet.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>SCFAs, predominantly acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are 2- to 4-carbon chain molecules that are primarily generated in the colon through fermentation of nondigestible dietary carbohydrates by gut microbiota (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition, SCFAs are present in some foods and beverages via generation in fermentation processes that occur during their production (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Increased generation of SCFAs in the colon and subsequent systemic delivery have been associated with improved colonic health and reduced metabolic disease and systemic inflammation, primarily in small animals (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, there have been difficulties translating these observations to therapeutic effects in humans, due to challenges with delivering adequate amounts of SCFA to the colon and inherent differences in SCFA metabolism and gut physiology between animals and humans (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p>Although SCFAs have potent effects on the immune system within animal models, evidence for the purported effects of SCFAs on the human immune system is primarily limited to studies in vitro, in which blood immune cells are exposed to SCFAs, often at concentrations well above physiologic levels (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The few studies performed in vivo have been limited to using dietary fiber supplements, have lacked dietary controls, and have not observed changes to peripheral blood SCFA concentrations (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref>). Yet, dietary intervention studies that successfully used fiber supplementation to increase fecal and plasma SCFAs did not address effects on immune parameters (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Exposure to SCFAs may modulate the activity of the innate and adaptive immune responses through directly engaging SCFA-specific G protein–coupled receptors (GPR41, GPR43, GPR109a) on the cell surface or by entering the cell to alter cellular metabolism and histone deacetylase activity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, effects on a variety of immune cell lineages and subsets might be anticipated. We previously showed that a 5-d high-fiber diet that successfully increases plasma SCFA concentration did not change proportions of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) or concentrations of a panel of plasma cytokines (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The increased exposure to SCFA in terms of concentrations achieved and/or its duration may have been insufficient to induce changes in healthy individuals. Altogether, there is a clear need for well-designed intervention studies to investigate if SCFA can indeed modulate the human immune system.</p>
              <p>Fermentable fiber supplements, such as high-amylose maize starch and inulin, are an effective way to increase colonic SCFA production in human subjects and are amenable to use in a blinded study design since they have little taste themselves and take up flavors well (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, oral intake of fermented foods such as apple cider vinegar can be used to acutely deliver SCFAs to the systemic circulation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). We hypothesized that supplementing a diet with a combination of dietary fermentable fiber [inulin and resistant starch (RS)] and oral SCFA (apple cider vinegar) would be a feasible strategy to increase colonic and plasma SCFA sufficiently to modulate aspects of the immune system in humans. Hence, the current study aimed to address this hypothesis with 3 major goals: first, to define the pharmacokinetics of blood SCFA concentrations during 3-wk consumption of a high-fiber diet with oral SCFA-rich foods; second, to assess changes to colonic fermentation resulting from increased fiber and oral SCFA intake; and third, to assess if this dietary intervention affects circulating immune cells in blood, particularly subsets of B and T lymphocytes shown to be modulated by SCFAs in preclinical models.</p>

                <p>Healthy adults who were aged 18–45 y inclusive and believed themselves to be in good health were recruited for this study. Exclusion criteria included a history of gastrointestinal or other chronic inflammatory disease, recent acute illness or infection, antibiotic use within 1 mo of study, consumption of probiotics or prebiotics within 1 mo of study, use of medication that could alter gastrointestinal transit (e.g., laxatives or hypomotility agents), pregnancy or planning pregnancy, an eating disorder, special dietary requirements (vegetarian/vegan), or current use of medication for hypertension. Volunteers who expressed interest in the study were screened with an eligibility questionnaire, followed by a face-to-face meeting with the study coordinator to obtain written informed consent.</p>

Each study participant undertook a 1-wk baseline (BL) period before being assigned via a random number generator (version 4; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.randomizer.org/</ext-link>) to either a low-SCFA (L-SCFA) or high-SCFA (H-SCFA) diet for 3 wk. Afterward, participants underwent a minimum 3-wk washout period where they were free to consume their habitual diets prior to completing the other 3-wk interventional diet. Subjects but not the investigators were blinded to the nature of the diet. On the morning of day 1 of the BL week, participants had 30 mL of peripheral venous blood collected. They also undertook 3-d total fecal collection during the BL week and completed a food and gastrointestinal symptom diary. This diary was also completed throughout the 3-wk dietary intervention period. At the end of the dietary intervention period, participants again had blood collected on the morning of day 20 or 21. They also completed 3-d total fecal collection on days 18–20 of the intervention period. Weight measurements were recorded with a digital physician scale (Tanita) during each study visit at Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. The study protocol was approved by the Monash University Human Research Committee (project no. 11190) and prospectively listed on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001054202).</p>

                <title>Intervention diets</title>
                <p>H-SCFA and L-SCFA diets were developed to meet the standards of the Australian Dietary guidelines (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and provided equivalent levels of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and other micronutrients. Nutritional composition was assessed using Foodworks Professional software (version 7.01; Xyris) with data from the NUTTAB (Nutrient Tables for Use in Australia; Food Standards Australia New Zealand) and Monash University FODMAP databases. The meal plans for both diets are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. The L-SCFA diet provided 18.6 g fiber/d, of which 1 g/d was RS and 1 g/d was nondigestible oligosaccharide. The H-SCFA diet contained an additional 20 g high-amylose maize starch/d (HAMS-1043; Ingredion) that was added to 2 food items, as indicated in Table 1. This was equivalent to approximately 10 g RS/d (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, 8 g of inulin [average degree of polymerization ≥10 (OraftiGR; Beneo)] was included in a daily meal. Taken together, the H-SCFA diet provided an additional 18 g of fermentable fiber each day. The macronutrient and fiber breakdown of the H-SCFA and L-SCFA diets is presented in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. To boost SCFA delivery, an apple cider vinegar drink consisting of apple cider vinegar (Melrose) mixed with an equal volume of flavored syrup (Cottee's Blackcurrant Cordial) was provided to participants to consume after each main meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Each drink contained approximately 25.8-mmol acetate, 0.05-mmol propionate, and 0.04-mmol butyrate as previously described (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A placebo vinegar drink was provided on the L-SCFA diet that contained flavored syrup and approximately 0.01% citric acid (McKenzie's). This was pH matched to the H-SCFA vinegar drink. Participants consumed 40 mL of this vinegar drink with 250 mL of water to prevent irritation of the esophagus. All meals were prepared, cooked, packed, and frozen under the supervision of qualified chefs in a licensed commercial kitchen with storage facilities [BASE Facility (Be Active Sleep Eat), Monash University]. Study food was packed in freezer bags and delivered to participants, who recorded their intake into a food diary as a measure of adherence to the diet. The study researcher provided a list of additional snacks (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref></bold>) that could be consumed to improve adherence to each diet. Furthermore, the study coordinator contacted study participants either in person or by phone each week to maintain adherence to the study diet.</p>

                <title>Dietary and symptom analysis</title>
                <p>Participants completed 7-d food diaries at BL, whereby they recorded all food and drinks consumed. Scored measuring cups and spoons were provided to participants to assist with this process. In addition, to improve the accuracy of data collection, participants recorded information on brands of food items consumed and documented recipes of meals cooked. Information contained in these diaries was first analyzed with Foodworks Professional (version 9.0) to calculate energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake and then analyzed with additional data from the Monash University FODMAP database (which includes oligosaccharide information) and an RS composition report (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) to generate detailed information on fiber intake.</p>
                <p>During the BL week and intervention diets, participants scored daily overall abdominal symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, passage of wind (gas), satisfaction with stool consistency, tiredness, and nausea using 100-mm visual analog scales, as previously applied (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Participants also recorded the number of bowel movements they had each day and their stool form based on the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS).</p>
                <p>Compliance to the intervention diet was assessed by examining the fold differences in RS and inulin intake from the L-SCFA to H-SCFA diets relative to the 18-fold change designed. Participants who achieved 80% of this expected fold change (equivalent to 15.2-fold change) were considered compliant to the intervention diets.</p>

                <title>Fecal collection and analysis</title>
                <p>Participants collected all fecal output for 3 d by placing freshly passed stools into provided plastic containers. These were sealed with a lid, sealed in another bag, and immediately placed into a portable freezer set at –20ºC. After the collection period, stool samples were transported to the laboratory at –20ºC for storage and processing. All fecal material collected was weighed to obtain 3-d and daily fecal output. The samples were thawed, pooled, and homogenized. Aliquots were subsequently stored at –80ºC. Fecal water content was estimated as previously described (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and expressed as a percentage of the initial wet weight of sample.</p>
                <p>Fecal pH was measured with a calibrated pH probe (Mettler Toledo) inserted into thawed fecal material warmed to 25ºC. Fecal ammonia was measured in duplicate via an enzymatic assay (Megazyme rapid ammonia assay) after protein precipitation and filtration as previously described (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Fecal SCFAs were measured in triplicate via GC as previously described (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Thawed fecal material was spiked with 3 times the volume of internal standard (1.68mM heptanoic acid), homogenized and centrifuged (2000 × <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>, 10 min, 4°C), after which 300 µL of supernatant was added to a 0.2-µm filter vial containing 10 µL of 1M phosphoric acid. The vials were then analyzed for SCFA content via GC using an Agilent GC6890 coupled to a flame ionization detector. CV &lt;10% was taken as a valid result for fecal ammonia and SCFA concentrations (micromoles per gram). Daily fecal output was used to calculate daily excretion of SCFAs (millimoles per day).</p>

                <p>Blood plasma was analyzed in triplicate for SCFA content using GC as previously described (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Briefly, 300 µL of plasma was spiked with 200µM heptanoic acid and acidified with 10% sulfosalicylic acid before the addition of diethyl ether solvent. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged so that the organic layer could be clarified and transferred to 0.2M NaOH. The alkaline solution containing SCFA was concentrated by evaporation via nitrogen, dissolved in 1M phosphoric acid, and transferred into a cold GC glass vial for analysis using an Agilent GC6890 coupled to a flame ionization detector. Concentrations for acetate, propionate, and butyrate were determined by the average of the triplicate results, where the CV was &lt;20%. Total SCFA was calculated by the sum of the individual SCFAs. Results were expressed as micromoles per liter. Data points below the limit of detection were excluded from relative change calculations.</p>

In brief, 50 µL of whole blood was added to a TruCount tube (BD Biosciences) with 20 µL of antibody cocktail (CD3FITC, CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD16-PE, CD56-PE, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD19-APC, APC-H7) for 15 min in darkness (gating strategy in <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1</xref></bold>). Red blood cells were lysed with the addition of 500 µL of ammonium chloride solution (0.155 M) prior to analysis on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). A small aliquot of whole blood was also analyzed using a Cell-Dyn Emerald instrument (Abbott) to cross-reference leukocyte numbers enumerated with flow cytometry.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>A sample size calculation was initially performed according to preliminary data (Treg as a percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) collected during a pilot study (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) to estimate the number of participants needed to observe a statistically significant difference in Treg number (20% change, effect size = 0.55) between the H-SCFA and L-SCFA dietary interventions (G*Power version 3.1). The minimum sample size required was 30 participants for a statistical power equal to 0.8 and an α level of 0.05 (2-tailed). With a 10% dropout rate, the sample size required was calculated as 33 participants.</p>
                <p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (version 8.02; GraphPad) and R (version 3.6.1) on a per-protocol basis. The primary endpoint examined changes to Treg number. Secondary endpoints included assessment of fecal metabolites and characteristics, plasma SCFA concentration, and other blood immune cell subsets. Endpoints were compared between the L-SCFA and H-SCFA diets using the paired samples Wilcoxon test. Correlation analysis between variables was calculated with the Pearson correlation test, with a correlation matrix assembled for all parameters recorded. False discovery rate corrections were applied to correlation data via the Benjamini and Hochberg method to correct for multiple comparisons. Immune network analysis was conducted with the R package Rtnse (version 0.15; <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/jkrijthe/Rtsne" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/jkrijthe/Rtsne</ext-link>), with perplexity set to 10.

                <p>Of the 126 individuals who expressed interest in the study, 22 met the criteria. Major reasons for ineligibility were logistical restrictions (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 43), being outside the age range (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12), dietary requirements (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9), and preexisting disease (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 8); thus, the original sample size of 30 participants was not reached. Of the 22 participants who were randomly assigned, 2 withdrew after completing 1 arm, both due to additional dietary requirements that arose during the washout period. A total of 20 participants completed the study between August 2018 and September 2019, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

Two participants achieved less than the minimum 80% cutoff with a 14.3- and 14.6-fold change increase, respectively. Similarly, adherence to the prescribed 3 vinegar drinks per day was high. Thus, during the L-SCFA diet, 18 of 20 participants reported consuming the allocated 3 drinks each day, with the remaining 2 participants consuming on average 2 drinks each day. During the H-SCFA diet, 16 of 20 participants consumed 3 drinks each day, with the remaining 4 consuming 2 drinks each day. When blinding was formally assessed upon completion of the study, 75% (15/20) of participants correctly recognized each diet. The vinegar drink containing apple cider vinegar was also correctly chosen by 80% (16/20) of the study cohort.</p>

Changes to Th2 cell numbers between the H-SCFA and L-SCFA diets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) were negatively correlated (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.08, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = –0.61; 95% CI: –0.83, –0.22) to changes in blood total SCFA concentrations. Furthermore, changes to CD8<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells were positively correlated (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.09, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.82) with changes in fecal isobutyric concentration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
                <p>Overall changes to the phenotype of the immune system were visualized by plotting all immune cell subsets with a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding approach.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We here demonstrated with a controlled dietary intervention that high dietary intake of SCFAs and fibers can increase total fecal SCFA concentrations and reduce fecal ammonia, consistent with an increase in and reduction of the colonic fermentation of fiber and protein, respectively. Furthermore, increases in plasma propionate and butyrate were observed after the H-SCFA diet, whereas acetate and total SCFA concentrations were unchanged. The H-SCFA diet was associated with changes in the circulating B- and T-cell compartments, with significant reductions in numbers of B cells, Th1 cells, Tfh1 cells, and MAITs. However, the magnitudes of these differences were small, and overall modulation of immune parameters tended to be unique to each individual.</p>
              <p>Building on our previous work (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), we hypothesized that dietary fiber and oral SCFA supplementation would increase delivery of SCFA to the systemic circulation. Indeed, colonic fermentation of carbohydrates was highly likely to be increased in the H-SCFA relative to the L-SCFA dietary period. First, the delivery of fiber to the colon was successful, as reflected in <italic toggle="yes">1</italic>) good compliance to the diets; <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>) the greater colonic gas production experienced by the participants, as anticipated from other studies using, for example, RS and inulin (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>); and <italic toggle="yes">3</italic>) the higher fecal output and proportion of stools that could be classified within 3–5 on the BSS. Second, fecal acetate and butyrate concentrations were greater relative to those associated with the L-SCFA diet. Third, protein fermentation was suppressed, as shown by a higher SCFA:branched-chain fatty acid ratio and reduced ammonia concentrations (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, we did not achieve a significant increase to overall plasma SCFA concentrations. This most likely relates to the low bioavailability of SCFAs to the systemic circulation given that, following oral ingestion or production in the colonic lumen, the majority of SCFAs will be metabolized by colonocytes or hepatocytes on their first pass. Indeed, systemic availability of colonic acetate, propionate, and butyrate has been estimated to be 36%, 9%, and 2%, respectively (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). After consumption of a vinegar drink containing 1.5 g of acetate, plasma acetate concentrations may transiently increase within 60 min, indicative of rapid absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In contrast, colonic fermentation of inulin, primarily in the cecum, produces a plasma SCFA peak approximately 4–6 h after consumption (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Consumption of RS may also increase plasma SCFA for &gt;6 h as it is slowly fermented, although previous studies have examined different forms of RS (e.g., pearl barley kernels, Nutriose) than the current study (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Such observations indicate that timing of blood sampling and participant meal consumption is critical if plasma SCFA concentrations are to be used as a marker of increased delivery of SCFA to the systemic circulation. These may not have been adequately controlled in this study to capture the transient increases to rapidly metabolized plasma SCFA (e.g., acetate) with a single measurement in all participants. The limited ability of plasma SCFA to reflect marked increases in delivery of SCFA during fermentable fiber supplementation also manifested in a feeding study of patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom fecal, symptomatic, and local fermentation characteristics were evaluated per a novel telemetric gas-sensing capsule (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Furthermore, variation in fecal SCFA concentration may occur due to the heterogenous nature of the sample, which was overcome by pooling fecal samples, despite the caveat of requiring an additional freeze-thaw step during processing (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p>
              <p>A novel aim of this dietary intervention study was to use detailed immunophenotyping to examine changes to the immune system that may have occurred as result of increased delivery of SCFA to the systemic circulation. We observed that naive B cells, Th1 cells, Tfh1 cells, and MAITs were significantly lower after the H-SCFA diet when compared with the L-SCFA diet. This may be suggestive of an anti-inflammatory effect of increased systemic SCFA delivery, in line with decreased peripheral blood inflammatory markers observed to occur in healthy people provided with prebiotic fiber supplements (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Indeed, healthy people who followed a high-fiber diet for 14 wk had increased fecal butyrate concentrations that correlated with decreases to overall B-cell frequency, a similar result to what we have observed after 3 wk of controlled interventional diets (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Increased naive B-cell numbers have been observed in the peripheral blood of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which may be due to impaired conversion to memory B cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Indeed, SCFAs are potent at inducing Ig class–switched B-cell subsets in animal models (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Although no changes to memory B-cell subsets were observed in our study, further intervention studies should examine whether increasing systemic SCFA delivery affects B-cell maturation during an immune challenge such as vaccination.</p>
              <p>Observations from mouse models suggested that delivery of SCFA to the systemic circulation may induce protective Treg cells, particularly in the gut (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We did not observe any significant changes to subsets of Treg between the intervention diets. Indeed, SCFA may directly upregulate the Treg transcription factor FoxP3, which was not included in our phenotyping panel (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, we did observe significantly lower MAIT numbers, a recently identified T-cell subset associated with gut-mucosal tissue that responded to gut microbiota–derived vitamin B metabolites (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). These cells would be exposed to high concentrations of SCFA in this environment, although it is unclear if human MAITs directly respond to SCFA as other gut-associated subsets such as T-cell receptor ɣδ<sup>+</sup> cells do (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Modulation of MAIT numbers in the peripheral blood may have been induced by altered microbial composition and function in the gut resulting from the intervention diets. This may have led to migration of MAITs out of the peripheral blood to the gut, as has been shown to occur in response to enteric bacterial or viral infection (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Similarly, Th1 cells were significantly lower after the H-SCFA diet than after the L-SCFA diet. A recent study that performed similar immunophenotyping in healthy people found reduced numbers of Th1 cells in the peripheral blood of individuals who had increased species of SCFA-producing bacteria <italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcus</italic>, which may be further indicative of an indirect effect of the intervention diets (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>
              <p>It is important to note that the magnitude of changes observed in this study was small, with network analysis via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, highlighting that overall changes to the immune cell populations clustered within each individual. Furthermore, the small size of the study cohort limited the statistical power of changes observed. Up to 80% of immune variation in humans may be related to nonheritable lifestyle factors, which cannot be completely controlled through a 10-wk intervention study (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Previous studies that have performed detailed immunophenotyping in patients with IBD or primary immune deficiency generally observed larger differences in T and B numbers (&gt;20%) when compared with healthy controls (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Nevertheless, we did find that median relative changes in overall B cells, naive B cells, and some T-cell subsets between the diets were in the range of 15%–30% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Increasing systemic delivery of SCFA through a dietary approach may have added benefit for those with IBD, as shifts in colonic fermentation observed through our dietary approach have been associated with anti-inflammatory effects in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Our diet was well tolerated by the healthy cohort of study participants, although further studies will need to assess tolerability in patients with IBD, who may already have lower habitual dietary fiber intake than a healthy cohort and have reduced compliance to dietary intervention many weeks in duration (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). A pilot study in small group of adults with multiple sclerosis found that 12 mo of following a high-fiber, vegetable-predominant diet significantly altered peripheral blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and improved clinical disease indices, highlighting that long-term dietary therapy to increase systemic SCFA may have more efficacy in other immune-mediated disorders (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p>
              <p>In conclusion, dietary intervention with fermentable fiber and oral SCFA to increase colonic and peripheral blood SCFA is a well-tolerated intervention that is associated with favorable changes to colonic fermentation, reducing fecal ammonia. Increased SCFA was also associated with changes to the distribution of lymphocyte subsets, with lower naive B cells, MAITs, and Th1 cells in the peripheral blood. Further studies are needed in larger cohorts to assess if phenotypical changes are also associated with changes to immune function to determine if dietary therapy may have therapeutic benefit in patients with inflammatory disease.</p>
