                <p>Intermittent fasting
(IF) increases lifespan and decreases metabolic
disease phenotypes and cancer risk in model organisms, but the health
benefits of IF in humans are less clear. Human plasma derived from
clinical trials is one of the most difficult sample sets to analyze
using mass spectrometry-based proteomics due to the extensive sample
preparation required and the need to process many samples to achieve
statistical significance. Here, we describe an optimized and accessible
device (Spin96) to accommodate up to 96 StageTips, a widely used sample
preparation medium enabling efficient and consistent processing of
samples prior to LC–MS/MS. We have applied this device to the
analysis of human plasma from a clinical trial of IF. In this longitudinal
study employing 8-weeks IF, we identified significant abundance differences
induced by the IF intervention, including increased apolipoprotein
A4 (APOA4) and decreased apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2) and C3 (APOC3).
These changes correlated with a significant decrease in plasma triglycerides
after the IF intervention. Given that these proteins have a role in
regulating apolipoprotein particle metabolism, we propose that IF
had a positive effect on lipid metabolism through modulation of HDL
particle size and function. In addition, we applied a novel human
protein variant database to detect common protein variants across
the participants. We show that consistent detection of clinically
relevant peptides derived from both alleles of many proteins is possible,
including some that are associated with human metabolic phenotypes.
Together, these findings illustrate the power of accessible workflows
for proteomics analysis of clinical samples to yield significant biological
insight.</p>

              <p>Intermittent fasting
(IF) is a dietary modification that generally
consists of alternating periods where food is freely available (<italic>ad libitum</italic>), followed by fasting periods of up to 24 h,
for 1–4 days/week. The fasting period that is most often tested
in animal models is 24 h. IF initiated in young adult and middle-aged
chow-fed mice increases maximal lifespan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Anson and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> re-stimulated interest in this model when they
observed that alternating periods of 24 h fasting and <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding reduced fasting glucose and insulin levels as effectively
as 60% daily calorie restriction, even though there was a minimal
reduction in either caloric intake, or body weight, versus pair
fed controls. This work suggests that intermittent energy deprivation
is sufficient to improve metabolic health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Intermittent fasting in model animals generally produces little
or no weight loss, but clearly reduces fasting glucose and insulin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> reduces blood pressure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> improves cardiac remodeling,
increases left ventricle ejection fraction response to myocardial
infarction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> reduces cell proliferation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> increases cancer survival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> increases adiponectin and lipid oxidation in muscle and
liver and reduces visceral fat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> However,
far fewer studies are reported for IF interventions in humans.</p>
              <p>Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a mainstay technology
for elucidating the biological functions of proteins on a large scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> In preparing samples for peptide-level proteomic
analysis (bottom-up proteomics), it is often necessary to concentrate
peptides and remove contaminants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> One
of the most commonly used methods in MS-based proteomics sample preparation
is offline reversed-phase solid phase extraction (SPE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> in which peptides are bound to a stationary phase, typically either
C18, or a mixed-mode resin, enabling simultaneous desalting, contaminant
removal, and concentration. Single-use StageTips are a widely used
implementation of SPE, as their small void volumes enable processing
of microgram amounts of proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> StageTips
can also accommodate a variety of stationary phases, expanding their
application to peptide fractionation, or to increase flexibility in
washing steps. For example, a mixed mode strong cation exchange (SCX)
and reversed-phase material may be used, which enables either the
removal of contaminants such as lipids from plasma-derived samples,
or the fractionation of peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Additionally, the StageTip format
is often incorporated into other proteomics workflows, such as in
the “in-StageTip” protocol in which samples are lysed
and digested directly within StageTips,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> or in the case of phosphoproteomics workflows to capture and retain
beads used for peptide enrichment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Here we describe a device
(Spin96) that can be rapidly produced
using widely available 3D-printers designed to accommodate up to 96
StageTips simultaneously. We have applied our Spin96 device to the
analysis of human plasma from a longitudinal clinical trial of IF.
Our intervention employed 8-weeks of IF with plasma samples and physiological
data collected before and after this period. Using established StageTip
methods and our device, we have identified significant differences
in plasma protein abundance induced by the IF intervention, particularly
in apolipoproteins. In addition, we have applied a protein variant
database to detect clinically relevant protein variants across the
participants. These data are the first unbiased analysis of plasma
proteome changes induced during IF. The complete design files for
the Spin96 are made freely available to the scientific community,
enabling local production of the device.</p>

                <title>Intermittent Fasting without
Weight Loss Clinical Trial</title>
                <p>Between 1 March 2013 and 4 September
2015, 119 women were screened
following advertisement in local newspapers and media to participate
in this single-center, randomized controlled trial in Adelaide, South
Australia. The Royal Adelaide Hospital Research Ethics Committee approved
the study protocol, and all participants provided written, informed
consent prior to their inclusion. The PREFER study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> was registered with <uri xlink:href="http://Clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</uri> (NCT01769976). A total of 88 women were
enrolled in the study, of which 25 were assigned to the intermittent
fasting with weight maintenance group (IF100) analyzed in this manuscript;
3 participants withdrew during the diet period (2 due to time, 1 no
longer wished to participate). The resulting 44 paired plasma samples
from 22 subjects in the IF100 group were the subject of this proteomic
analysis. Inclusion criteria were: aged 35–70 years; BMI 25–42
kg/m<sup>2</sup>; weight-stable (within 5% of their screening weight)
for &gt;6 months prior to study entry; no diagnosis of type 1 or type
2 diabetes; nonsmoker; sedentary or lightly active (i.e., &lt;2 moderate
to high-intensity exercise sessions per week); consumed &lt;140 g
alcohol/week; no personal history of cardiovascular disease, no diagnosis
of eating disorders or major psychiatric disorders (including those
taking antidepressants); not pregnant or breastfeeding; and not taking
medication that may affect study outcomes (e.g., phentermine, orlistat,
metformin, excluding antihypertensive/lipid lowering medication).
The primary outcome of this study was insulin sensitivity, assessed
by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Secondary outcomes were plasma
markers of blood glucose control, body fat and anthropometric measures,
adherence, hunger and appetite, weight, plasma markers of cardiovascular
risk, and hepatic biomarkers.</p>
                <p>The active trial period was 10
weeks, comprised of a 2-week lead-in period, and 8 weeks of dietary
intervention. During the lead-in period, participants consumed their
normal diet and maintained their weight. Following this, participants
were placed on an intermittent fasting diet at 100% of calculated
baseline energy requirements per week (i.e., weight maintenance).
Energy requirements were calculated using an average of published
equations, both of which use age, gender, height, and weight variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not possible.</p>

                  <p>On fed days, participants were provided with food
equal to ∼145% of energy requirements. On fasting days, participants
consumed breakfast before 8 am (∼37% of energy requirements
were given at breakfast on fasting days) and were then instructed
to “fast” for 24 h, until 8 am the following day. Participants
were advised to fast on 3 nonconsecutive weekdays per week. During
the fasting period participants were allowed to consume water and
limited amounts of energy-free foods (e.g., “diet” drinks,
chewing gum, mints), black coffee and/or tea, and were provided with
250 mL of a very low energy broth (86 kJ/250 mL, 2.0 g protein, 0.1

                <p>Initially, we performed some QC analysis on the samples from our
proteomic data set to determine if either coagulation, or red blood
cell lysis, occurred in any of the plasma samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). This showed that no participant
displayed a &gt;10-fold loss in fibrinogen proteins (FGA, FGB, FGG),
indicating that the anticoagulant (K+-EDTA) had functioned effectively.
A plasma sample from one participant before the IF intervention showed
4-fold higher than the PREFER population average for von Willebrand
factor (VWF) and fibronectin (FN1), which may potentially indicate
either arterial disease or recent injury. One participant sample showed
significant increases in hemoglobins (HBA, HBB, HBD) and carbonic
anhydrase (CA1), indicating that this blood sample underwent some
red blood cell lysis during processing. We also examined the variance
in protein abundance (LFQ intensity) both between and within participants
before and after the IF intervention using six marker plasma proteins
covering 5 orders of magnitude in protein abundance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b). Among these proteins, albumin
(ALB) the most abundant protein in plasma showed little variation
both between and within individuals with a CV across all samples of
10.6%. In contrast, other marker proteins showed large variability
in relative abundance between individuals, with lower variability
within an individual’s samples. The protease inhibitor alpha2-macroglobin
(A2M) had an overall CV of 24.9% and had marked abundance differences
in several participants. However, both immunoglobulin class mu heavy
chain (IGHM) and pregnancy zone protein (PZP) showed 10-fold or larger
abundance differences between individuals with CVs of 40.3% and 144.9%,
respectively. The large variability in PZP between subjects is not
surprising given its low abundance in nonpregnant women and abundance
variance by 3–4 fold between individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> The lower abundance plasma proteins Cysteine-rich secretory
protein 3 (CRISP3) and Coagulation factor XIIIa (F13A1) also showed
strong participant-specific protein abundance with CVs of 42.1% and
47%, respectively. These data agree with previous studies demonstrating
participant-specific protein abundance profiles and demonstrate the
value of longitudinal analysis rather than cross-sectional studies
for plasma proteome characterization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> To examine variation in the proteome in response to IF and minimize
variance due to the differences in protein abundances between participants,
we calculated an adjusted LFQ intensity, which forces all participants
to have the same mean intensity for each protein. From these values
we calculated the % CV for each protein during the IF response across
all participants except 2 participants who were removed due to the
sample quality issues above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c). These proteins have been classified into 3 groups,
those with % CV &lt; 20 (green ∼65% of proteins), % CV of 20–40
(orange ∼30% of proteins), and % CV &gt; 40 (red ∼5%
of
proteins). These data show that higher abundance proteins generally
have lower % CV values, which is to be expected given the high signal-to-noise
ratio for quantitation of the abundant proteins. These data also showed
that many IgG-related proteins displayed % CV values &gt;40, as did
cadherin-5
(CDH5), beta actin (ACTB), VWF, and FN1.</p>

Plasma Proteins</title>
                <p>To provide
an overview of the changes induced by the IF intervention across all
participants we plotted a heat map of the adjusted LFQ intensity for
all 172 proteins ranked by protein abundance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a). This confirmed that very few proteins
drastically changed abundance due to the IF intervention and only
a few changes were immediately obvious by eye. These include the increased
hemoglobin isoforms from the participant whose plasma sample taken
after the IF intervention displayed hemolysis, which therefore makes
these proteins appear highly differential between the two time points.
In addition, fibronectin (FN1) appears to be significantly perturbed
across several participants. To identify statistically significant
differences due to the IF intervention, we generated a volcano plot
showing fold-changes versus a paired test statistic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). Only 11 of the 172 proteins
had a <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.05, with modest median
fold-changes between 5 and 30% in either direction. Of these proteins
apolipoprotein A4 (APOA4) and clusterin (CLU) were the most significantly
up-regulated, while apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2) and apolipoprotein A2
(APOA2) were the most significantly down-regulated proteins. All five
of these proteins are functionally related in the regulation of HDL
particle metabolism. To examine more closely the response of each
participant to the IF intervention we plotted the adjusted LFQ intensity
for the proteins showing significant changes due to the IF intervention
and for a negative control albumin (ALB), with each participant as
a separate line on the plot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090/suppl_file/pr9b00090_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). For each
of these proteins, many participants displayed much larger fold changes
of up to 2-fold after the IF intervention, compared to the fold change
calculated from the median values used in the volcano plot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). For each of these

fibrinogen proteins (FGA, FGB, FGG), or coagulation factor XIII (F13A1

between alpha1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) and either the Framingham Risk

calculation of the FRS. As would be expected, the glucose infusion
rate (Clin. GIR, normalized to insulin levels and fat mass) was positively
correlated with HDL levels (Clin. HDL), and negative correlated with
the inflammatory protein alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 2 (ORM2). To identify
any associations between the proteins significantly changing due to
the IF intervention and the remaining clinical or protein parameters,
these proteins were specifically examined. Interestingly, APOA4 showed
a significant positive correlation with plasma gelsolin (GSN) a protein

                <p>Given the depth of proteome coverage we have achieved, we wanted
to identify peptides characteristic of known human protein coding
variants (derived from SNPs), some of which are known to be associated
with metabolic phenotypes. To achieve this, we generated a database
of the 172 plasma proteins consistently identified in our samples
and for each protein used the Uniprot Natural Variant annotations
to generate additional database entries (full protein sequence) containing
the associated amino acid change (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090/suppl_file/pr9b00090_si_003.zip">File S2</ext-link>). We then used this variant database in a combined search with a
full human database from SwissProt in MaxQuant to identify and quantify
the peptides present in our plasma samples (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090/suppl_file/pr9b00090_si_002.xlsx">Table S6</ext-link>). To our surprise we were able to identify &gt;20 protein
coding
variants, where peptides specific to natural alleles could be observed
across the participants. To narrow our list of high-quality variants,
we ignored those that had either any missing values, where peptides
from both alleles could not be observed, or have been shown previously
to cause benign changes to the protein’s function. This yielded
7 variants in APOA4, paraoxonase (PON1), alpha1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1),
histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), apolipoprotein E (APOE) and transferrin
(TF) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090/suppl_file/pr9b00090_si_001.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link> for annotated spectra).
Using the intensity values for the peptides specific to each allele
we generated a bar plot for each of the 44 participant samples where
the summed intensity of both peptides was set to 100% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). Most of these peptides had
conservative amino acid changes and only moderate intensity differences
between the allele-specific peptides was seen, likely due to similar
peptide ionization efficiencies. Thus, participants that had peptides
detected from both alleles have colored bars with each showing ∼50%
of the summed intensity, while participants that only had one type
of allele detected have bars of a single color (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). In six of these protein variants, clinically
relevant phenotypes have been associated including drug response (APOA4

              <p>Here
we present an unbiased analysis of human plasma following
a clinical trial of intermittent fasting (IF). These samples were
analyzed using a 3D-printed device, the Spin96, to increase efficiency
and consistency of the sample preparation with a low-cost and readily
accessible device. From this analysis, we identified ∼200 plasma
proteins that we correlated with a swath of clinical phenotypes to
examine the molecular adaptations that occur with IF. In addition,
we were able to detect a number of clinically relevant protein variants
at the peptide level using a unique protein variant database. Together,
this study provides a novel device and protocol for processing of
large numbers of plasma samples and novel insights into the potential
mechanisms behind IF beneficial effects in humans.</p>
              <p>Plasma is
an easily accessible sample from human clinical trials,
which when analyzed with current proteomics workflows, can provide
insight into possible mechanisms in the development of clinical phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> Particularly useful are intervention-based longitudinal trials where

number of samples (≤96), compatible with the current nanoLC–MS/MS
based proteomics throughput of ∼1 sample per hour. To date,
proteomics studies of plasma have focused on the analysis of the top
200–1000 most abundant proteins, using either no depletion
strategy, or with employment of abundant protein depletion with affinity
columns. As suggested previously, depletion columns likely have their
own caveats regarding lot-to-lot reproducibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> and excessive cost. Our device offers a faster approach
to StageTip sample preparation, and a similar number of proteins identified
compared to previous nondepleted plasma analysis studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> We observed far fewer proteins when compared
to studies using either more in-depth fractionation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> or recently improved MS acquisition strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> However, these strategies still do not provide
easy access to very low abundance plasma proteins such as insulin,
GLP-1, or chemokines. The field would be greatly accelerated by the
implementation of improved plasma analysis workflows to access these
clinically relevant low abundance proteins/peptides.</p>
              <p>Our analysis
detected the up-regulation of the apolipoprotein A
IV (APOA4) protein in human plasma after 8-weeks of intermittent fasting.
This is interesting given that higher levels of APOA4 have been associated
with many beneficial phenotypes such as promotion of reverse cholesterol
transport, increased satiety, and decreased LDL particle oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> APOA4 has been quantified as strongly expressed
in the small intestine by the luminal epithelial cells and to a much
lower extent by cells in the liver and other tissues of both humans
and mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> APOA4 is present in plasma in either a lipid-free
form, associated with chylomicrons, or associated with HDL particles,
which makes sense given its known functional associations. In previous
studies, plasma abundance of the APOA4 protein has been shown to increase
after either a high fat diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> or bariatric
surgery, where it was positively correlated with increased HDL cholesterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> In contrast, APOA4 protein abundance after weight loss has been
reported to either decrease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> or slightly
increase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup> indicating that weight loss
alone does not strongly influence the abundance of this potentially
beneficial protein. Several human protein-coding SNPs of APOA4 have
been associated with clinical phenotypes, which includes the N147S
variant detected in this study that is associated with the response
to fenofibrate treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Another phenotype
associated with several APOA4 variants is altered plasma total triacylglycerol
abundance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref></sup> which is in agreement with our
correlation analysis.</p>
              <p>In addition to APOA4, we also observed
significant changes in CLU,
APOC2, APOC3, and APOA2, which are all related to either lipid, chylomicron,
or HDL-particle metabolism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>). Of particular interest is the decrease in protein
abundance of APOC3 in plasma with IF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b), as it has been previously demonstrated
to decrease triglyceride lipolysis through direction inhibition of
lipoprotein lipase (LPL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup> and to also
decrease the uptake of triglycerides into tissues such as the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref></sup> Together, this suggests a combined regulatory
effect of intermittent fasting to increase triglyceride lipolysis
in chylomicrons and increase the production of mature spherical HDL-particles.
This hypothesis fits with our clinical observations that plasma total
triglycerides were significantly decreased after intermittent fasting
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090/suppl_file/pr9b00090_si_002.xlsx">Table S3</ext-link>); however, total HDL abundance
was not significantly changed after IF. Future analysis of participant
plasma samples using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to detect
HDL particle size distributions before and after the intervention
would help address these aspects of APOA4 function. Validation of
these findings in different cohorts with larger numbers of participants
will be important to confirm their functional significance.</p>

the short time scale of our IF intervention, and that most patients
maintained a constant BMI, it is most likely that a change in LDL
is the reason for the positive FRS change. This agrees with the observed
negative correlation between plasma SERPINA1 abundance and LDL levels
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Indeed,
previous studies have demonstrated a clear interaction between SERPINA1
and the LDL-associated protein, lipoprotein A (LPA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup> LPA is a key component of LDL particles where it is directly
bound to the major LDL component, apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB100).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref></sup> Our data support the hypothesis that increasing
plasma SERPINA1 levels will lead to a decrease in blood LDL levels,
through its association with the LDL-associated protein LPA.</p>
              <p>The analysis of protein coding SNPs offers a direct link between
genetic mutation and clinical outcomes as it relates to human disease.
We have adapted a human protein variant database for the detection
and quantitation of protein variant-derived peptides. Most of these
amino acid variations were conservative changes and only moderate
intensity differences between the allele-specific peptides were observed.
However, SNPs that introduce more divergent amino acids could pose
a detection/quantification problem. For example, we observed some
peptide variants such as HRG (N493I), where intensity differed by
3-fold between alleles in heterozygous individuals, which may reflect
different ionization efficiencies. Given that these data are protein
based, we cannot discriminate between the true genotype of these individuals
and any allele-specific expression that may occur for each gene analyzed.
However, the fact that we observed the expected allele frequencies
in 4 of the 7 clinically relevant protein variants suggests that we
are observing peptide abundance in concordance with the genomic alleles.
For the 3 protein variants that showed a significant deviation from
the European population allele distribution there are two main reasons
for the observed deviation. First, those participants selected for
the PREFER trial (including BMI &gt; 25) may be enriched/depleted
for
those specific genotypes, which may provide a genetic predisposition
to becoming overweight, or how the subject would respond to IF. Second,
the proteins we have examined may display allele-specific expression.
Unfortunately, matching tissue samples for genotyping were not available
in the PREFER trial. To confidently associate specific SNPs to observed
phenotypes future studies need to apply this method across larger
cohorts of participants to provide greater statistical power. Preferably,
these measurements can then be matched to tissue samples to correlate
these data with the DNA-derived genotype of each participant.</p>
              <p>The Spin96 device offers fast and reproducible proteomics analysis,
further facilitating the use of proteomics over conventional protein
analysis methods such as either ELISA assays, or Western blotting.
Proteomics-based approaches offer an unbiased quantitative analysis
at a reduced cost per detected analyte at an increased speed and with
higher specificity. While more conventional approaches are still useful
for their great precision, they are not easily compatible with the
analysis of large numbers of samples and the simultaneous detection
of many proteins.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In summary, we developed
a 3D printed 96 well device for StageTip-based
SPE of peptide samples derived from human plasma. The application
of this device and optimized protocol enabled the detection of significant
changes in the plasma proteome after IF, which may mediate some of
the observed beneficial phenotypes derived from IF. Furthermore, we
have demonstrated the ability to identify several novel correlations
between clinical measures and the identified proteins from this clinical
trial. Lastly, we have detected many peptides derived from nonsynonymous
protein-coding variants of plasma proteins including several that
are clinically significant. Together, these findings illustrate novel
changes in the human plasma proteome in response to intermittent fasting
using a new sample preparation device.</p>
