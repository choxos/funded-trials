                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of hepatitis B infection and impaired seroconversion to hepatitis B vaccine (HBV). Studies examining augmented vaccine schedules to enhance seroconversion have so far been inconclusive. Furthermore, the defects responsible for impaired vaccine immunity in CKD have not yet been identified.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We studied serological and cellular responses to HBV in CKD to identify a defect in vaccine-induced cellular responses that could account for impaired seroconversion in CKD and clarify the effects of an augmented vaccine dose schedule. We compared these results with responses to seasonal influenza vaccination (Fluvax).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We found a clear benefit in rates and magnitude of seroconversion after an augmented 40mcg HBV dose schedule in CKD. This permitted comparison of responders and non-responders. Serological non-responders with CKD exhibited reduction in CXCR3+CCR6- CXCR5+ memory T cells at baseline. Unlike Fluvax, HBV elicited a poor plasmablast (PB) response. Both vaccinations induced activation of the CXCR3<sup>+</sup>CCR6<sup>-</sup> CCR7<sup>-</sup> subset of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH), although this response was impaired in CKD after HBV.</p>

                  <p>CKD confers a specific T cell defect that contributes to the impaired seroconversion to HBV.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>End-stage renal disease confers a state of chronic immune deficiency, which results in poor response to standard vaccination regimens, and increased risk of infection, including chronic viral infections that can increase risk of cancer [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The risk of hepatitis B virus infection is particularly significant due to increased exposure to the virus during dialysis, and an increased risk of chronic infection and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Current guidelines recommend routine vaccination of dialysis patients with three or four 40mcg doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), however, there is no universal dosing recommendation for pre-dialysis CKD patients [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 20mcg of HBV intramuscularly at 0, 1, 6 months in pre-dialysis patients. A significant proportion of CKD patients vaccinated prior to the commencement of dialysis remain at risk of contracting hepatitis B virus due to impaired seroconversion and rapid decline of protective titers [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several studies have sought to address the possible benefit of augmenting the pre-dialysis schedule to four 40mg doses, however the data are so far inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Elucidating the mechanism of vaccine unresponsiveness could help to characterize the nature of immune deficiency in CKD. So far, various cellular defects in immunity have been identified, including quantitative and functional defects in lymphocyte compartments [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] secondary to increased activation and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. B cell compartment defects include reduced absolute numbers of total, innate, naïve and memory B cells [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One possible explanation is reduced expression of B-cell activating factor of the TNF-family (BAFF)-receptor [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. T cell compartment defects include low absolute counts of total [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], naïve and central memory T cells of both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some of these defects have been partly attributed to the metabolic derangements of uremia and hyperphosphatemia [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. At the same time, there is an inverse relation between glomerular filtration rate and markers of inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Possible explanations include decreased cytokine clearance, increased gut permeability, periodontitis, and oxidative stress of uremia [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>High-affinity antibody responses depend on interactions between T and B cells in specialized microanatomical sites called germinal centers (GC), located in secondary lymphoid organs [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. T follicular helper cells (TFH) are a subset of CD4 T cells characterized by high level expression of CXCR5 and PD-1, and the capacity to secrete IL-21[<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. TFH provide help to B cells at priming and to centrocytes in GC that results in their differentiation into memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. Memory B cells are thought to serve as precursors of long-lived plasma cells after re-encounter with antigen. Recently, progress has been made in monitoring these cellular events in peripheral blood. 5–8 days after booster parenteral vaccination PB can be detected in the peripheral circulation [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These PB are antigen-specific, predominantly of IgG isotype, and their peak in peripheral blood correlates with serological response [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, a peripheral cellular signature of events within GC has been pursued by enumerating putative circulating counterparts of TFH [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These cells are memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing the B-cell-zone homing chemokine receptor (CXCR)-5, high levels of Inducible Co-stimulator (ICOS) [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which is critical for TFH development [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and Programmed Cell Death (PD)-1 [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], a marker of recent T cell activation via the T cell receptor. Chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6 have previously been identified as surrogate markers of effector T cell differentiation including within GC (CXCR3<sup>+</sup>CCR6<sup>-</sup> (Th1), CXCR3<sup>-</sup>CCR6<sup>-</sup> (Th2) and CXCR3<sup>-</sup>CCR6<sup>+</sup>(Th17)) [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and have also been demonstrated to distinguish functional cTFH subsets [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. cTFH that express CXCR3 but not CCR6 transiently increase 7 days following influenza vaccination, are antigen-specific, upregulate expression of ICOS and PD-1, and correlate with both serological response and the day 7 peak in PB [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>We applied this approach to investigate the cellular events that accompany the serological response to immunization in CKD. We show that while primary immunization with HBV elicits a poor PB response, it specifically activates the CXCR3+CCR6-PD-1+CCR7- subset of cTFH in healthy age-matched controls (HC). This cTFH response is not seen in CKD. By contrast, Fluvax generates robust PB and cTFH responses in both CKD and HC. Additionally, CKD patients who fail to sero-respond to HBV demonstrate reduced proportions of CXCR3+CCR6- cTFH at baseline prior to vaccination. Finally, we show that an augmented 40mcg dose schedule of HBV can overcome the serological defect in many CKD patients, although this does not restore the peripheral cellular events to normality.</p>

                <p>The study was approved by The Canberra Hospital Human Research and Ethics Committee in 2011. All recruits provided written informed consent to participate. Patients with stage 4 (15–29 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) or 5 (&lt;15 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) CKD requiring HBV for routine care were recruited through the Department of Renal Medicine at The Canberra Hospital. The study protocol was modified and approved in 2013 to include recruitment of patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD requiring routine Fluvax, and HC requiring routine vaccination with either HBV or Fluvax. HC requiring routine HBV or Fluvax for occupational reasons were recruited via the Occupation Medicine Unit at the Canberra Hospital, and via a private geriatrics outpatient clinic at National Capital Private Hospital, Canberra. Undetectable HBsAb titer (&lt;10mIU/ml, ARCHITECT anti-HBs, Abbott, Ireland) was a pre-requisite to enrolment to the HBV arm. Trivalent, split virion, inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluvax containing A/California/7/2009, A/Victoria/361/2011 and B/Wisconsin/60/2008, CSL Australia) was used throughout the study period from 2012–2013. HC received standard schedule [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] HBV (recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, Engerix-B, GlaxoSmithKline) consisting of three doses of 20mcg, at 0, 1 and 4 months or at 0, 1 and 6 months. CKD patients receiving HBV were randomized, at a ratio of 1:1, via computer generated random number (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.randomizer.org/">https://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>) to receive either four doses of 20mcg or four doses of 40mcg of HBV at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. Consecutively numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes were opened in sequence at the time of randomization. Patients were not blinded to their randomization because the augmented dose required two intramuscular injections instead of one, and this was detailed in the patient information sheet read by patients prior to study enrolment. Exclusion criteria for CKD patients were dialysis or kidney transplant. Exclusion criteria for all groups included cancer, infection, chronic inflammatory disease, immunosuppressive medication or other defined immunodeficiency.</p>

                <title>Serological analysis</title>
                <p>All subjects who received HBV underwent serum collection four weeks after the final dose for HBsAb titer, with seroconversion defined as a titer ≥ 10 mIU/ml. The study protocol was modified and approved in 2015 to include collection of longitudinal serology from CKD patients and HC already recruited to the study. Serum collection was repeated between 3–5 years later to determine longitudinal HBsAb titer for both CKD patients and healthy controls. Both patients and healthy controls were recruited between January 2011 and July 2018, however only patients recruited by the end of December 2015, and who completed all follow-up by December 2016, have been included in the current analysis. The authors confirm that trials for this intervention are registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12618000631202).</p>

                <p>Samples were thawed and analyzed by FACS in batches, ensuring paired samples (baseline and day 7) for any given patient were analyzed in the same batch. Samples were labelled using anti-CD3 PerCP, CD14 PerCP, CD19 PE-Cy7, CD38 V450, CD27 APC, HLA-DR APC-H7, followed by fixation and permeabilization (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD biosciences), then labelled for intracellular immunoglobulin expression using anti-IgG PE, IgA biotin and IgM FITC. Cells were then stained with streptavidin-conjugated V500 in permeabilization-compatible wash, before suspension in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)(GIBCO, LifeTechnologies). (All conjugated antibodies were obtained from BD biosciences except IgM FITC (Dako)). In separate experiments (as indicated), samples were stained for cTFH using anti-CD3 FITC, CCR6 PE, CCR7 PE-Cy7 (BD biosciences), CD4 APC-Cy7, CD45RA Pacific Blue, CXCR5 PerCP/Cy5.5, CXCR3 Brilliant Violet 510 (Biolegend), PD-1 biotin and streptavidin-APC (eBioscience). After staining, samples were washed in (PBS) with 2%(FBS), and fixed (Cytofix, BD biosciences). Samples were re-suspended in PBS for data acquisition on FACSCanto II or Fortessa (BD Biosciences). FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo (Version 10, Treestar Inc). Randomly selected samples underwent repeat analyses using either panel, to determine assay reproducibility and validity. To confirm the validity of the assay on frozen and thawed samples, paired analyses were performed on fresh and frozen samples from a single donor (data not shown).</p>

                <p>Fifty-seven patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD were enrolled between 2011 and 2015, inclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Patient demographics and characteristics are shown in <xref rid="pone.0204477.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. 22 patients had diabetic nephropathy, of which 18 were taking insulin, 7 of whom were also on oral hypoglycaemic medication, and three were taking oral hypoglycemic medication only. Only one patient with diabetic nephropathy was not taking either medication. Other causes of renal disease were membranous glomerulonephritis (4), IgA nephropathy (4), renovascular disease (4), vasculitis (2), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (2), mesangiocapilliary glomerulonephritis (1), lupus nephritis (1), hypertension (1), polycystic kidney disease (1), embolic disease (1), obstructive uropathy (1), and unknown cause (13). Of these patients, two were taking insulin and oral hypoglycaemic medication (both with unknown cause of renal disease), and three were taking oral hypoglycaemic medication only (two patients with IgA nephropathy, and one with renovascular disease).

                <p>At baseline, patients with CKD were lymphopenic relative to healthy controls (HC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Total B cells were significantly reduced in CKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) due to reductions in memory and switched memory B cells. Median total B cell count in CKD (0.08 x10<sup>9</sup>/L) was below the lower limit of our locally derived normal range (0.14–0.54 x10<sup>9</sup>/L). CKD patients also had significantly lower absolute counts of total and CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). More detailed analysis of memory T cells revealed a trend towards a reduction in naïve CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), as reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Both HC and CKD demonstrated median absolute CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts below the lower limit of the diagnostic assay range (0.3–0.9 x10<sup>9</sup>/L), consistent with a decline in this population with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Central memory CD4- T cells appeared significantly reduced in CKD, however absolute counts were low in both CKD and HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Despite this finding, further analysis demonstrated a correlation between age and total T cells, and age and CD4+ T cells in healthy controls, but not between age and CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204477.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Age did not correlate with total T cells, CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells in CKD patients. There was no correlation between age and total B cells, or age and memory B cells, in either HC or CKD (data not shown). Median values for serum immunoglobulins (Ig) were within normal ranges in both HC (median values–IgG 8.83g/L, IgA 2.13g/L, IgM 0.88g/L) and CKD (median values—IgG 10.14g/L, IgA 2.59g/L, IgM 0.87g/L) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204477.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

                <title>Post-vaccination hepatitis B serology</title>
                <p>As noted in earlier studies, we observed a significant incidence of serological non-responsiveness in CKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) (47% versus 27% in HC), although CKD responders generated titers of similar magnitude to HC. The median post-vaccination hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titer was not significantly different between CKD and HC. However, in CKD patients, the 40mcg dose schedule resulted in a significantly higher median post-vaccination HBsAb titer (95mIU/ml vs &lt;10mIU/ml), and reduced the rate of non-responsiveness (24% vs 71%) compared to the 20mcg dose group. Furthermore, only two (8%) of the patients who received the 20mcg schedule attained an HBsAb greater than 100mIU/ml, compared to 12 (28%) of those who received the 40mcg schedule. Hence, overall, the 40mcg schedule in CKD resulted in rates and magnitude of seroconversion comparable to HC. Thus, the serological defect observed in CKD with a 20mcg dose schedule could be overcome by an augmented 40mcg dose schedule.</p>

Longitudinal serology for these initial responders is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204477.s005">S5 Fig</xref>. While the number available for analysis was small, we observed a significant decline in HBsAb titer in CKD; We observed a decline in HBsAb over time in healthy controls (non-significant).

To determine whether failure of PD-1 upregulation on CXCR3+CCR6- cTFH cells was specific to HBV or to CKD, we performed a similar analysis after Fluvax. Interestingly, we observed that seasonal influenza vaccination elicited median increases in PD-1 MFI on both CCR7- and CCR7+ subsets, specifically in CXCR3+CCR6- cTFH, and the magnitude of increase was greater within the CCR7- subset. The responses were similar for magnitude and rate in both CKD and HC.</p>

                  <p>We also examined whether the poor sero-response to HBV in CKD could be explained by differences in PB formation (assay development and gating strategy shown in Parts A and B of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204477.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). PB were enumerated on day 7 and compared to baseline (expressed as change in proportion of plasmablasts, ΔPB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). We characterized PB according to isotype, using cytoplasmic staining for IgG, IgA and IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). 55% of circulating PB expressed IgA at baseline, whereas 27% expressed IgG (Part C of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204477.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). We then measured the change in abundance of PB expressing each isotype on day 7 compared to baseline. HBV did not elicit a PB response, nor a change in isotype, within the PB population, in either HC or CKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), irrespective of HBV vaccine dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). There was no correlation between PB response and either seroconversion or HBsAb titer after HBV, in either HC or CKD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204477.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Within the CKD cohort, there was no correlation between eGFR and PB response (data not shown). To clarify whether the absence of a PB response was specific to HBV, we compared PB responses to Fluvax in HC and CKD. By contrast, Fluvax elicited a robust PB response of similar magnitude in both HC and CKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), predominantly accounted for by an increase in IgG PB, with a smaller increase in IgA PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The change in total PB, and IgG PB, was significantly greater after Fluvax than after HBV in HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). A similar difference between vaccination types was seen in CKD, with increases in total and IgA PB significantly greater after Fluvax.</p>

                  <title>PB response correlates with PD-1 upregulation on a subset of cTFH</title>
                  <p>We have demonstrated that HBV elicits upregulation of PD-1 on CXCR3+ CCR6- cTFH in HC, but not in CKD. By comparison, Fluvax elicited both upregulation of PD-1 on CXCR3+CCR6- cTFH and a PB response, in both HC and CKD. We were therefore interested in whether there might be a correlation between cTFH and PB responses. We found a strong correlation between IgG PB response and PD-1 upregulation within CXCR3+CCR6-CCR7- cTFH and CXCR3+CCR6-CCR7+ cTFH in HC who received Fluvax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>), but not in CKD after Fluvax, or after HBV in any group. Significant correlations were also seen between IgG PB response and CXCR5+ cTFH (Part A of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204477.s012">S12 Fig</xref>), as well as total CCR7+ and CCR7- cTFH (Parts B and C of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204477.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>End stage renal disease appears to be a state of immune deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with increased risk of infection and of viral infection-related cancer [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Detailed information regarding the immune defects conferred by CKD has been difficult to obtain. We characterized memory and effector T and B cell compartments in CKD and examined how these lymphocyte populations respond to vaccination. We observed that a higher proportion of CXCR3+ cTFH at baseline is associated with a more robust response to vaccination, and that activation of this subset of cTFH correlated with vaccine response. At baseline, CKD patients are relatively deficient in the CXCR3+ cTFH subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), and this is more pronounced in serological non-responders to HBV vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
              <p>Current vaccines depend for their efficacy on generation of high affinity antibodies, which depends in turn on affinity maturation within GC reactions, wherein proliferating B cells acquire somatic mutations in Ig genes, and are selected according to antigen affinity [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204477.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Survival depends on provision of T cell help. TFH cells were first described as follicle-resident T cells, and exhibit a unique capacity to provide B cell help, including within GC [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204477.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204477.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. GC are relatively inaccessible in humans, but a subset of circulating memory T cells shares characteristics with GC TFH, including the capacity to provide B cells with help [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We observed an increase in PD-1 expression on the CXCR3+ subset of cTFH after HBV vaccination of healthy controls, but not in CKD patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204477.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Upregulation of PD-1 does not reflect increased abundance of PD-1+ cTFH cells after vaccination, but suggests activation rather than proliferation or increased release of this subset from GC into the circulation.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, we observed similar numbers of CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells in CKD and age-matched controls, and identified a deficiency in the CXCR3+ subset of CXCR5+ cTFH cells in CKD. Our study population was predominantly elderly. Another recent study identified a relative deficiency of cTFH in elderly individuals (without CKD) [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and also reported that cTFH cells in the elderly express higher levels of ICOS, consistent with a higher background level of T cell activation. ICOS expression correlates with PD-1 expression on cTFH in both health and autoimmune disease [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We examined PD-1 as a marker of baseline T cell activation, however, did not observe any correlation between age and expression of PD-1+ on cTFH. Abundance of PD-1+ CXCR5+ cells has been shown to correlate with influenza vaccine responsiveness in the young but not in the elderly [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which could account for why baseline PD-1 expression did not distinguish sero-responders, or between CKD and HC, in our mostly elderly cohort.</p>
              <p>PD-1 is upregulated after stimulation through the T cell receptor, and is a negative regulator of T cell activation and proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], including on GC TFH where PD-1 is expressed at high levels [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In HC, we observed that serological response to both Fluvax and HBV correlates with induction of PD-1 expression by CXCR3+ cTFH. The defect in induction in CKD is not absolute, since it was observed in CKD patients after Fluvax. We observed a correlation between induction of PD-1 on CXCR3+ cTFH and PB induction in health controls after Fluvax. This response was observed in both CCR7+ and CCR7- subsets of cTFH, and although the response was of greater magnitude in the CCR7- compartment, induction of PD-1 on CCR7+ cells correlated best with IgG PB response. These findings are consistent with induction the of PD-1 on cTFH as a readout of a productive T-dependent B cell response. By contrast, the absence of a corresponding PB response after HBV indicates an origin of cTFH activation other than germinal center(s), such as via activation of mature naïve T cells in a B cell-independent fashion [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The defect in CKD would therefore appear to be within B-independent T cell responses.</p>
              <p>Previous studies suggested that CCR6+ cTFH correlate with established or chronic antibody responses. In juvenile dermatomyositis, an increased proportion of CXCR3-CCR6+ cTFH has been reported to correlate with both disease activity and circulating PB numbers [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Likewise, abundance of PD-1<sup>low</sup> CXCR3- cTFH correlates with the presence of highly specific, broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By comparison, data reported here is consistent with other results that show that the CXCR3+ cTFH subset responds to immediate antigenic challenge, particularly after influenza vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The absence of expansion of CXCR3+ cTFH in our study might reflect a difference between the elderly and children, since we did not observe expansion of the CXCR3+ subset in HC either.</p>
              <p>One possible model to account for our findings and those reported previously is that different cTFH subsets act at different stages in the generation of specific antibody responses. Activation of CXCR3+ CCR6- cTFH is observed in response to both novel and recall antigenic challenges, as suggested by their activation after both influenza vaccine and HBV. Conversely, CXCR3- (predominantly CCR6+) cTFH correlate with the magnitude and maintenance of the subsequent antibody response, perhaps in response to repeated or chronic antigenic stimulus, as evidenced by their correlation with specific antibody responses in chronic autoimmune disease and HIV. The integrity of serological immunity function depends on both baseline proportions of cTFH subsets and their activation state, as suggested by the apparent inability of hyper-activated, ICOS+ cTFH to support specific antibody responses in the elderly, and dysregulation of cTFH in autoimmune disease.</p>
              <p>The results of this study are limited by several factors. First, the CKD patients were not blinded to their group allocation. In theory, this may have affected compliance with completion of the full vaccination schedule, but there was no difference in discontinuation rates between the vaccine dose groups. There was no 40mcg dose control group, which may have been informative in further clarifying serological and cellular defects seen in CKD. The risk of type II error may have been increased by failure to enrol the pre-determined number of patients (81 CKD patients), particularly for several cellular correlates of a serological defects in CKD, nevertheless, we demonstrated a significant serological response to the augmented vaccine dose in CKD patients.</p>
              <p>In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that a four-dose schedule of 40mcg of HBV is superior to a 20mcg four-dose schedule when administered to patients with CKD prior to initiation of dialysis. The augmented schedule resulted in superior rate and magnitude of seroconversion. Only the 40mcg schedule elicited HBsAb titers greater than 100mIU/ml, a preferential cutoff in CKD patients commencing dialysis, as it is associated with longer duration of sero-protection [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These results suggest that a four-dose regimen of 40mcg should be administered routinely to all CKD patients when in preparation for dialysis. Recently, HBV using a recombinant antigen conjugated with a TLR9-agonist exhibited improved seroconversion in CKD [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. While the cellular mechanism to account for this response remains to be determined, one hypothesis is activation of Th-1 CD4+ T cells [<xref rid="pone.0204477.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The findings reported here provide an opportunity to test the cellular basis of this finding, in order to optimize vaccine responses in patients with CKD.</p>

                  <title>TFH gating strategy.</title>
                  <p><bold>(a)</bold>. Staining and gating strategy for Tfh cells was performed using human tonsil. After gating on each of the four populations within the CXCR5 CD45RA plot, cells were analyzed for CXCR3 versus CCR6 expression, and CCR7 versus PD-1 expression to identify the population of interest. CXCR5hi PD-1hi bona fide TFH cells are rare in peripheral blood (red square). The cells most closely resembling circulating counterparts of TFH in tonsil are CXCR5+PD-1+ cells (blue square), and therefore peripheral blood staining was based on this phenotype. <bold>(b)</bold>. Gating strategy to determine CXCR5+ memory cells, subsets based on CXCR3 and CCR6 expression, and PD-1 expression. This was compared to CXCR3, CCR6 and PD-1 expression on CXCR5-CD45RA+ naive CD4+ T cells. After gating on CD4+ T cells, CXCR5+ memory cells (pink) and naive cells (orange) were then analyzed for CXCR3 and CCR6 expression. Most naive CD4+ T cells are CXCR3-CCR6- CCR7+, and do not express PD-1. Therefore, CXCR3-CCR6- naive cells were used to determine the PD-1 and CCR7 gates on CXCR5+ memory cell subsets, including for abundance of PD-1+ cells (histogram) irrespective of CCR7 expression. All values shown are percentages.</p>

                  <p>(a) Flow cytometric analysis of human tonsil for the identification of plasmablasts. After gating on lymphocytes according to forward and side scatter, cell populations are selected which are negative for CD3 and CD14 expression, positive for CD19, CD27 and CD38 (oval gate), and express high levels of MHC class II. (b). The same staining and gating strategy is applied to the analysis of peripheral blood. Since plasmablasts downregulate CD19, this gate is set to capture CD19lo cells. Analysis before (<italic>top row</italic>) and seven days after (<italic>bottom row</italic>) seasonal influenza vaccination in a healthy control identifies an increase in plasmablasts at day 7, which predominantly express cytoplasmic IgG. (c). Baseline (prevaccination) proportions of plasmablasts according to cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype expression in healthy controls (HC-blue circles) and CKD patients (black circles); each circles represents an individual.
