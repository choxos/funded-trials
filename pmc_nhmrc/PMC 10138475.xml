                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Secondary prophylaxis to prevent rheumatic heart disease (RHD) progression, in the form of four-weekly intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G (BPG) injections, has remained unchanged since 1955. Qualitative investigations into patient preference have highlighted the need for long-acting penicillins to be delivered less frequently, ideally with reduced pain. We describe the experience of healthy volunteers participating in a phase-I safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic trial of <underline>s</underline>ub<underline>c</underline>utaneous <underline>i</underline>nfusions of high-dose benzathine <underline>p</underline>enicillin G (BPG)–the SCIP study (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12622000916741).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants (n = 24) received between 6.9 mL to 20.7 mL (3–9 times the standard dose) of BPG as a single infusion into the abdominal subcutaneous tissues via a spring-driven syringe pump over approximately 20 minutes. Semi-structured interviews at four time points were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Tolerability and specific descriptors of the experience were explored, alongside thoughts on how the intervention could be improved for future trials in children and young adults receiving monthly BPG intramuscular injections for RHD.</p>

                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Participants tolerated the infusion well and were able describe their experiences throughout. Most reported minimal pain, substantiated via quantitative pain scores. Abdominal bruising at the infusion site did not concern participants nor impair normal activities. Insight into how SCIP could be improved for children included the use of topical analgesia, distractions via television or personal devices, a drawn-out infusion time with reduced delivery speed, and alternative infusion sites. Trust in the trial team was high.</p>

                <sec id="sec004">
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Qualitative research is an important adjunct for early-phase clinical trials, particularly when adherence to the planned intervention is a key driver of success. These results will inform later-phase SCIP trials in people living with RHD and other indications.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Benzathine penicillin G (BPG) has been used since the 1950s for the prevention and treatment of recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), caused by repeated <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (Strep A) infections [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. BPG is manufactured by Pfizer (NY, USA) and marketed in Australia as Bicillin® L-A [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For secondary prophylaxis (SP) of ARF, the current Australian recommendation is for intramuscular (IM) injection into the outer quadrant of the buttock every 21 to 28 days (1.2MIU dose; 2.3ml) for a minimum of five years, with the aim of preventing rheumatic heart disease (RHD) [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Globally, RHD affects more than 40 million people with approximately 340,400 deaths annually, predominantly in resource-limited settings [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Additionally, over 471,000 cases of ARF are estimated each year, further placing affected individuals at risk of permanent heart damage [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite being regarded as a nation with a high standard of health, Australia has an inequitable burden of ARF and RHD in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, with annual ARF rates in northern Australia approximating 150–380 per 100,000 among those aged 5–14 years [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Sixty-one percent of those with ARF will go on to develop RHD within 10 years, and once diagnosed, 27% will develop heart failure within five years [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is estimated that there are more than 5,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are currently living with ARF or RHD, and that by 2031, there will be a further 8,667 cases, resulting in 663 deaths [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285037.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Such statistics position RHD as a major driver of cardiovascular inequality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</p>
              <p>Regular IM injections of BPG are the only proven treatment to prevent recurrent ARF and progression to RHD [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Oral regimens have more complicated dosing schedules, making adherence difficult and have been shown to offer suboptimal protection [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Australian guidelines recommend a minimum adherence to 80% of planned injections (11 of 13 4-weekly doses delivered annually) to provide adequate protection against recurrent ARF [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2019 only 37% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians prescribed SP achieved this target [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Drivers for low adherence to SP include health care access, quality of health care, health care literacy [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and fear of injection and injection pain [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Eurocentric health systems and systemic racism are also detailed as key barriers to achieving high uptake of SP [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Pain relieving methods including the addition of lignocaine to BPG [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and/or the use of a Buzzy® device [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have resulted in an incremental increase in secondary prophylaxis adherence, however rates remain well below optimal [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These barriers and investigations into patient and service-provider preference have emphasised an urgent need for new longer acting penicillins, with the ideal compound being cost effective, subcutaneously administered and offering a longer duration of protection of three months or more [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Prior research into these preferences has also demonstrated that subcutaneous delivery of BPG is safe, tolerable and potentially results in less frequent administration [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Qualitative research is a useful accompaniment to clinical trials, providing insight into the impact of complex procedures beyond quantitative pain scores, pharmacokinetics, or efficacy of an intervention [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There is a growing emphasis on the need to gain insight into the patient experience, inclusion of their voice and perspective through approaches including semi-structured interviews, focus groups or observations [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. When appropriately employed, these methods can aid investigators in gathering complementary data that contribute to answering the research question, distilling findings and determining feasibility by assessing acceptability to healthcare providers and patients [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For these reasons, we undertook a qualitative sub-study alongside a phase-I trial to describe the experience of healthy volunteers receiving <underline>s</underline>ub<underline>c</underline>utaneous <underline>i</underline>nfusions of high-dose B<underline>P</underline>G (SCIP) [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285037.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>The clinical aspects of the SCIP trial have been described elsewhere by Kado et al [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285037.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In summary, the study assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of high dose of BPG (Bicillin® L-A, produced by Pfizer [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) in 24 healthy adult volunteers delivered as a single subcutaneous infusion via a spring-driven syringe infusion pump (Springfusor<sup>®</sup>30, Go Medical Industries Pty Ltd., Subiaco, Australia), a variable flow control device (VersaRate<sup>®</sup> Plus, EMED Technologies, El Dorado Hills, California, USA) and a 22G SC catheter (BD Saf-T-Intima<sup>TM</sup>, BD Medical, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Participants were assigned to receive either 3.6 MIU (6.9mL, n = 4), 7.2 MIU (13.8mL, n = 10) or 10.8 MIU (20.7mL, n = 10) 3, 6 and 9 times the standard dose respectively, with lignocaine co-administered to reduce pain. On average the infusion took approximately 20 minutes for the largest dose. Safety assessments, pain scores and penicillin concentrations (measured from dried blood spots; DBS) were measured for 16 weeks post dose [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>For the qualitative component, all study participants were interviewed in English by one of two investigators at four timepoints–immediately prior to their infusion, during their infusion, two hours post-infusion and approximately seven days after dosing. All interviews occurred face-to-face. Interviews were between five and thirty minutes in length, with the first three taking place bedside in the clinical suite the trial was being conducted in, and the last in a private consult room. The semi-structured interviews used a standardised interview guide consisting of a series of open-ended questions regarding reasons for taking part in the study, experience of clinical procedures (including dried blood sample [DBS] collection from finger prick samples, intravenous cannula, and subcutaneous catheter insertion), experience of the infusion, tolerability of the procedure, ability to manage pain in the days post-infusion and suggestions for improvement. Participants were also asked to reflect on how this procedure might be tolerated by children, adolescents and young adults living with ARF [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Suggestions of appropriate alterations to improve tolerability were explored.</p>
              <p>Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were thematically analysed according to the methods detailed by Braun and Clarke [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Transcripts were read repeatedly by one investigator (SE) who had conducted half of the interviews with participants and highlighted initial codes using NVIVO 12 [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These preliminary codes were discussed with another investigator (JK) who had conducted the remaining interviews and further reviewed to form themes. To improve rigour, results were discussed with the trial team and those present on dosing day to ensure accuracy of data interpretation. Additionally, a content analysis of all transcripts was undertaken to determine the words or phrases participants most used to describe the infusion experience.</p>
              <p>The study was approved by Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee (2020-12-1348) and registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12622000916741). All participants provided written, informed consent prior to participating.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>The 24 participants recruited to the SCIP trial had a median age of 26.9 years and 20 (83.3%) were male. Nine (37.5%) were Caucasian, 8 (33.3%) Asian, 3 (12.5%) Latino, 2 (8.3%) African and 2 (8.3%) of mixed ethnicity. While English was known to be a second language for several participants these data were not captured, however English competency was a requirement for participation in the trial. All consented to their interviews being recorded. As staffing capabilities were constrained on one of the dosing days, questions asked during and two two-hours post infusion were combined and asked during a single recording for four participants. No participants missed an opportunity to be interviewed at timepoints two, three or four and data from 92 recordings were included in the final analysis. The themes discussed below are presented in a manner that aims to demonstrate the participant journey through the study experience. Pseudonyms are used in place of names with basic demographic data provided.</p>

                <title>Financial and altruistic reasons for participation</title>
                <p>Most participants had no prior experience with clinical trials, with the SCIP trial being their first. On dosing day, no participant deemed the extensive follow-up schedule to be a possible hindrance or inconvenience. Around one-third of participants stated that they chose to participate due to financial renumeration. Furthermore, as the study required only one day of confinement it was perceived as more convenient when compared against other studies that involved confinement of a week or more. Other participants reported being primarily interested in the research with renumeration offering an added incentive. The ‘brand’ of the sponsor, an independent academic medical research institute focusing on child health, appeared to be perceived highly among the participants who were motivated to take part in the trial to ‘<italic toggle="yes">do their part</italic>.’</p>

                <p>The DBS collection was one of the first procedures participants experienced on the day of their confinement and was repeated three more times in the 12-hours post-infusion and 14 times during follow-up.

                <p>Others reported minor pain only because they did not know what to expect. A countdown was reported as one way of overcoming this, which anecdotally was a method employed by the trial staff member undertaking follow-ups. For the few participants who experienced a painful first blood spot, it was recalled as being due to needing multiple punctures or inappropriate positioning of the lancet reinforcing the need for staff to be appropriately trained prior to conducting this procedure.</p>

                <title>Low pain resulting from the insertion of the subcutaneous abdominal catheter</title>
                <p>The subcutaneous infusion of high-dose BPG was given via a catheter inserted into the lower abdomen, lateral to the umbilicus, without topical analgesia. Most participants reported very little to no pain during this procedure, with many stating they expected much worse given its placement in an area most people rarely receive injections in:</p>

                <p>Participants were informed that the infusion had the potential to be painful but were aware that given the Phase-1 nature of the trial, additional information could not be provided. While most participants had a tolerable infusion experience, some experienced acute discomfort.

                <p>Participants also expressed that while the initial half or three quarters of the infusion were tolerable and did not hurt, it began to get more intense towards the end of the infusion.

                <p>Participants expressed physical comfort in the position they remained in during the infusion (supine with a pillow under head). As one participant remarked–‘<italic toggle="yes">It doesn’t feel like anything is even happening</italic>.’ Several participants explicitly stated that they appreciated the privacy that was provided to them, especially considering the location of the procedure and the fact that the abdomen was exposed throughout, however demographic commonalities were not able to be identified to explore this further. One participant who recalled being slightly elevated propped himself up and it made no effect on the infusion indicating that patient preference should always be a consideration.</p>
                <p>Given the infusions occurred in a hospital-ward style room with only curtains for privacy, it was difficult to keep participants unaware about the experiences of others. While participants could not see each other behind the bedside curtains, many stated to hearing the infusion experience of others–inclusive of pain descriptors and verbal reactions—which may have heightened their anxiety immediately prior to the infusion. This sentiment was expressed by those who were beside someone who had an intolerable infusion and is a consideration for further iterations of this trial.</p>

                <p>There was great variability in the acceptability of the time the infusion took. For some–notably those who experienced no discomfort–they felt it could have been shorter. Others thought it could have been prolonged a bit more given their association of pain with infusion speed, while others were accepting of a larger amount of pain over a shorter period. A subset of participants were expecting an injection rather than a prolonged infusion and therefore were probably not mentally prepared for 20 minutes of intense observation with a large trial team. While the infusion was explained as part of the consent process, this misunderstanding highlights a need to ensure participants wholly comprehend what is being asked of them perhaps via demonstrations or images.</p>

Approximately one-third of participants had no concerns. For those who reported pain, it did not appear to be particularly limiting. Many noted that they were expecting a degree of discomfort given they had undergone a medical procedure and adjusted their physical movements accordingly.

                <p>Despite a local anaesthetic being provided, many participants felt that it was inadequate for a paediatric cohort and additional pain relief would be likely if the procedure was to be undertaken on a child. A topical anaesthetic was also discussed by some participants to reduce the feeling of the needle being inserted into the abdominal region. Furthermore, some participants noted that additional pain relief in the days following the infusion may lead to fewer side effects and pain, particularly as children are expected to be more active. This also included therapies like hot or cold compresses around the area. A few participants stated possibly slowing down the infusion rate as potentially beneficial–especially if paired with a distraction–reflecting on their own experiences of heightened pain when the infusion ran too fast.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Qualitative research was integrated into the methodology of this trial to better understand the recipient experience of a procedure previously not completed in a volunteer cohort. Given the previously described patient preference for BPG delivery that is less frequent and less painful [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0285037.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we weighted equally patient tolerance and pharmacokinetics of the infusion as markers of success. Large doses of BPG delivered by subcutaneous infusions are safe and may be suitable for three-monthly dosing intervals for SP of RHD [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This sub-study also found the procedure to be well accepted by participants and mostly tolerable while providing suitable suggestions for improving later study iterations–particularly those in paediatric cohorts.</p>
              <p>An element of phase-1 trials which is challenging to address is adequately preparing participants for what to expect, given that by their very nature, there is little prior experience to draw on. This was evident in SCIP specifically for accurate description of pain and the kinds of discomfort likely to be experienced. Concerningly, the qualitative data highlighted two participants were not expecting an extended infusion, apparently interpreting the information provided during screening and the consent process to mean the procedure was a single and quick needle. To address this unexpected gap between ‘informed consent’ and a clear understanding of the procedures involved, we will be adapting recruitment materials for similar research to include illustrative resources and a greater discussion with study investigators. This combination of verbal, written and even pictorial evidence has been shown to enable higher health literacy and engagement with trial expectations and anticipated outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and will be an important aspect to study further with later trial iterations.</p>
              <p>SCIP participants were generous in their suggestions on how to improve the study for children, with answers to these questions often the most in-depth answers to any on the guide. These ideas, specifically distractions, a slower infusion time and larger doses of lignocaine anaesthesia, are likely to be integrated into SCIP-II highlighting the importance of understanding the participant experience in early phase clinical trials. A critical question that we were unable to address in this study was how the experience of subcutaneous infusion compares with current practice for SP; i.e., IM injections of BPG every three to four-weeks. The next phase of this research is to undertake a similar study in a cohort of children, adolescents and young adults currently living with ARF (SCIP-II, to be completed in New Zealand) and these questions will be explored with participants through qualitative investigation. In addition, as most pain experienced by participants during the infusion pertained to its speed, alternate infusion methods that allow for more control of injection–including hand pushing of syringes–are under investigation for the second phase and are expected to incorporate greater provision of analgesia.</p>
              <p>Significantly more research is required before it can be determined if this nascent procedure is clinically safe and effective and offers desired penicillin concentrations above that required to protect against Strep A infection. However, as investigations progress, we as authors advocate for considerations to be made regarding culturally appropriate techniques for engagement and clear communication with the target population given the burden of ARF and RHD in Australia specifically is experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. At Telethon Kids Institute–where this research was conducted–the <italic toggle="yes">Guidelines for the Standards for the Conduct of Aboriginal Health Research</italic> were published in 2022, assisting staff to understand what actions and activities they must take throughout their research projects to meet the best practice expectations outlined by both the Institute and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [<xref rid="pone.0285037.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This eight-step process encourages Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander involvement well before projects seek ethical approvement for conduct, and will be used to guide additional study iterations where this population is specifically included.</p>
              <p>A strength of this study is that all participants consented to be interviewed and no participant missed a timepoint where qualitative data were collected, likely due to the timepoints of interview (three on the same day) and rapport with the interviewer undertaking questioning at day-7 post interview. Additionally, the same two people conducted all interviews, with the seven-day timepoint completed by the investigator most familiar with participants (having been present at dosing day and the four follow-up appointments since). This allowed for the development of rapport and ultimately, the final interviews were the most in-depth. However, given some adverse events extended beyond 7-days post-infusion, excluding interviews at later follow-up appointments limited opportunities to explore these experiences further. To address this SCIP-II will be involving interviews with participants on infusion day and 28- and 70-days post-infusion. A further study limitation was that all interviews were completed in English which may have repressed the true expression of those for whom this was not their first or most comfortable language. Certain demographic data was not collected (i.e., parental status, preferred language) which impeded a more in-depth analysis of the transcripts and ascertainment of data limitations. Additionally, some transcripts were incomplete where background noise or accents made words unascertainable.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Qualitative research is a suitable method to be integrated into clinical trials, providing more in-depth information to the tolerability and acceptability of a procedure. The pharmacokinetic data from SCIP support the infusion of high-dose BPG as a possible alternative to monthly IM SP, a finding that would likely be redundant should it prove to be more painful or less tolerable than the current therapy. Our qualitative data demonstrated that the procedure under investigation was acceptable to participants with tolerable discomfort for most. It also identified a subset of participants with more extreme pain, and potential approaches that could be explored to alleviate this. Furthermore, findings from this sub-study have allowed for the development of more detailed participant information sheets for the SCIP-II trial–with suggestions provided by participants of SCIP-I to be incorporated for paediatric and adult cohorts.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: To the Authors:</p>
              <p>In their manuscript, Qualitative assessment of healthy volunteer experience receiving subcutaneous infusions of high-dose benzathine penicillin G (SCIP) provides insights into design of late phase clinical studies, Dr. Enkle and colleagues describe the results of a qualitative investigation into the tolerability of a subcutaneous infusion of benzathine penicillin in adult volunteers. The protocol was designed to capture meaningful experiential details at multiple time points. The authors write that the results may influence the protocol of a clinical trial, wherein patients (mostly pediatric) will be treated with such infusions in place of monthly IM injections.</p>
              <p>The volunteer responses are summarized and tabulated were possible.</p>
              <p>Many of the findings revolve around specifics of infusion with respect to speed and anesthesia. It would be interesting to know if the investigators are motivated by these results to define alternative infusion protocols when adverse symptoms are experienced.</p>
              <p>Missing from the interviews was a question along the lines of “If you felt it was medically important, would you be willing to attend every three months for a repeat infusion.” One infusion may not indicate long term tolerability. It will be interesting as the underlying clinical trial proceeds to ask patients who have previously been receiving monthly injections how they perceive the subcutaneous infusion as an alternative.</p>
              <p>The investigators also noted two subjects who had not understood procedural details despite explanations during the discussion before informed consent. The authors describe modifications that may be made to improve comprehension.</p>
              <p>In summary, these results address important details that may inform the process for optimizing patient comfort with and acceptance of a novel process of secondary prophylaxis against RHD.</p>
              <p>Specific comment:</p>
              <p>Page 11, line 12:</p>
              <p>Correct this sentence: “In the week following the SCIP, there was no suggestion the procedure did not appear to disrupt the lives of the participants…”</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you.</p>
              <p>this is a well written manuscript regarding a pilot study of the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous infusions in healthy volunteers.</p>
              <p>Specify whether infusions occur by gravity or via a pump.</p>
              <p>were interviews only conducted face-to-face or via telephone as well?</p>
              <p>Not withstanding that this is a Phase I study, there are references for but limited discussion of potential issues for introducing this to the intended target population. Some further discussion around difficulties and culture-appropriate techniques for engagement and clear communication with a remote indigenous population (children, youth and adults) in view of these results would be helpful.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Arteaga-Livias</p>
              <p>Thank you for the opportunity to submit a revised version of the original research article entitled “Qualitative assessment of healthy volunteer experience receiving subcutaneous infusions of high-dose benzathine penicillin G (SCIP) provides insights into design of late phase clinical studies” (PONE-D-22-31775).</p>
              <p>We are grateful for the time taken by the reviewers to improve this piece of work and as such have made the following changes.</p>
              <p>1. (Editor): Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.</p>
              <p>The manuscript has been amended to meet PLOS ONE style requirements. </p>
              <p>2. (Editor): Please provide additional details regarding participant consent. </p>
              <p>All participants provided written, informed consent. Additional information to clarify how consent was obtained and what types has been included in the manuscript and online submission statement. </p>
              <p>3. In the ethics statement in the Methods and online submission information, please ensure that you have specified (1) whether consent was informed and (2) what type you obtained (for instance, written or verbal, and if verbal, how it was documented and witnessed). </p>
              <p>All participants provided written, informed consent. This has been included in the Methods of the manuscript and the online submission information. </p>
              <p>4. (Editor): Thank you for stating the financial disclosure: Please state what role the funders took in the study. If the funders had no role, please state: "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript." </p>
              <p>These statements have been provided accordingly. </p>
              <p>5. (Editor): In your Data Availability statement, you have not specified where the minimal data set underlying the results described in your manuscript can be found. For more information about our data policy, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability</ext-link>. </p>
              <p>A supplementary file with a minimal data set has been provided. </p>
              <p>6. (Reviewer 1): ‘Many of the findings revolve around specifics of infusion with respect to speed and anesthesia. It would be interesting to know if the investigators are motivated by these results to define alternative infusion protocols when adverse symptoms are experienced.’</p>
              <p>We thank reviewer 1 for this suggestion and as this is being explored in the second phase of the research (SCIP-II) have included a brief notation as to considerations of strategies. </p>
              <p>7. (Reviewer 1): Missing from the interviews was a question along the lines of “If you felt it was medically important, would you be willing to attend every three months for a repeat infusion.” One infusion may not indicate long term tolerability. It will be interesting as the underlying clinical trial proceeds to ask patients who have previously been receiving monthly injections how they perceive the subcutaneous infusion as an alternative.</p>
              <p>As the next iteration of the study is enrolling participants with ARF and RHD who are presently undergoing monthly injections, this question is being asked to serve as a point of comparison. Further information to this point is included in the discussion. </p>
              <p>8. (Reviewer 1): Correct this sentence: “In the week following the SCIP, there was no suggestion the procedure did not appear to disrupt the lives of the participants…”</p>
              <p>This sentence has been amended to read as follows: ‘In the seven days following the infusion, there was no indication that the procedure disrupted the lives of the participants.’</p>
              <p>9. (Reviewer 2): Specify whether infusions occur by gravity or via a pump. </p>
              <p>Amendments have been made to the methods to clarify that the infusion occurred via a a spring-driven syringe infusion pump (Springfusor®30, Go Medical Industries Pty Ltd., Subiaco, Australia), a variable flow control device (VersaRate® Plus, EMED Technologies, El Dorado Hills, California, USA) and a 22G SC catheter (BD Saf-T-IntimaTM, BD Medical, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).</p>
              <p>10. (Reviewer 2): Were interviews only conducted face-to-face or via telephone as well? </p>
              <p>All interviews occurred face-to-face and this has been clarified in the methodology. </p>
              <p>11. (Reviewer 2): Not withstanding that this is a Phase I study, there are references for but limited discussion of potential issues for introducing this to the intended target population. Some further discussion around difficulties and culture-appropriate techniques for engagement and clear communication with a remote Indigenous population (children, youth and adults) in view of these results would be helpful.</p>
              <p>We thank Reviewer 2 for this comment and note it to be an important consideration. A further paragraph has been included in the discussion specific to this point. </p>
              <p>All authors continue to have no conflicts of interest to disclose. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</p>
