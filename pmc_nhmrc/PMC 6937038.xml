                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in children is the most frequent reason for non-elective hospital admission. During the initial phase, AHRF is a clinical syndrome defined for the purpose of this study by an oxygen requirement and caused by pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections, asthma or bronchiolitis. Up to 20% of these children with AHRF can rapidly deteriorate requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation. Nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy has been used by clinicians for oxygen therapy outside intensive care settings to prevent escalation of care. A recent randomised trial in infants with bronchiolitis has shown that NHF therapy reduces the need to escalate therapy. No similar data is available in the older children presenting with AHRF. In this study we aim to investigate in children aged 1 to 4 years presenting with AHRF if early NHF therapy compared with standard-oxygen therapy reduces hospital length of stay and if this is cost-effective compared with standard treatment.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The study design is an open-labelled randomised multicentre trial comparing early NHF and standard-oxygen therapy and will be stratified by sites and into obstructive and non-obstructive groups. Children aged 1 to 4 years (n=1512) presenting with AHRF to one of the participating emergency departments will be randomly allocated to NHF or standard-oxygen therapy once the eligibility criteria have been met (oxygen requirement with transcutaneous saturation &lt;92%/90% (dependant on hospital standard threshold), diagnosis of AHRF, admission to hospital and tachypnoea ≥35 breaths/min). Children in the standard-oxygen group can receive rescue NHF therapy if escalation is required. The primary outcome is hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes will include length of oxygen therapy, proportion of intensive care admissions, healthcare resource utilisation and associated costs. Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.</p>

              <p>Of the 6.3 million children under the age of 5 years worldwide who died in 2013, over 1 million deaths were caused by acute respiratory infections causing acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In limited-resource settings, children with severe pneumonia have a mortality rate between 13% to 20% and most deaths occurring with hypoxaemia before therapeutic benefit of antimicrobials.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> While the paediatric mortality due to respiratory infections has decreased in high-income countries, AHRF is the most frequent cause of hospital admission resulting in major consumption of healthcare resources.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> Asthma, pneumonia and bronchiolitis-associated hospitalisations in children in the USA are estimated to account for over US$3 billion of costs per year.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is an emerging trend to improve respiratory gas exchange with methods other than oxygen, particularly in the early stage of disease process aiming to prevent the progression of the disease.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>However, to date, the provision of positive pressure ventilation has been restricted to intensive care settings, which remains costly, is a limited resource and requires technical expertise. In view of the global burden of respiratory disease the WHO recognises oxygen as a potential life-saving treatment and is advocating to develop low cost and low technology oxygen delivery methods that can be delivered in most healthcare settings.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Currently, standard oxygen therapy is delivered either using nasal prongs with low flow oxygen up to 4 L/min or using a face mask with oxygen flows of up to 8 L/min. Nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy is a new promising mode of respiratory support applied as an alternative to non-invasive ventilation, a potentially less tolerated respiratory support.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 9</xref> NHF therapy can be used very early in the disease process and requires little cooperation by the child. Several studies have shown that NHF therapy creates a distending pressure of the lung with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) effect of approximately 4 to 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O using flow rates of 1.5 to 2 L/kg/min in infants &lt;12 months of age.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> NHF therapy also decreases the work of breathing.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref> Because of its easy application and the fact that little cooperation of the patient is needed, NHF therapy in emergency departments (ED) has become increasingly popular.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–18</xref> However, the data remains equivocal. A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) using NHF therapy in adult patients with AHRF showed that NHF therapy compared with standard-oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation resulted in reduced mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) and at 90 days.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Yet meta-analysis, including this study, failed to show any definitive benefit for treatment failure or in-hospital mortality.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
              <p>The recent multicentre Paediatric Acute Respiratory Intervention Study (PARIS) RCT performed in Australia and New Zealand showed that NHF therapy in infants with bronchiolitis (aged &lt;12 months) had a lower failure rate of 12% compared with standard-oxygen with 23% failure rate.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> In this study performed in EDs and paediatric wards in general hospitals or tertiary children’s hospitals, no difference in the overall hospital length of stay or ICU admission rate was observed. These results are supported by an earlier single-centre RCT in patients with bronchiolitis which also found a lower failure rate with NHF, but no difference in hospital length of stay or length of oxygen treatment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</p>
              <p>In a recent pilot study, we tested the feasibility of using NHF therapy in 552 children presenting with AHRF (excluded were infants with bronchiolitis &lt;12 months of age). Included were children aged 0 to 16 years presenting with AHRF (SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;92%) to the ED and requiring hospital admission. The majority of children (79%) presenting with AHRF were aged between 1 to 4 years. Of these children allocated to early NHF therapy, 12% required escalation of care compared with 17% of children allocated to standard-oxygen therapy (data to be published). The data suggests that there is a beneficial role of NHF therapy in children with AHRF. Due to a lack of high-grade evidence we designed the PARIS 2 study, a randomised multicentre RCT to test the hypothesis that children with AHRF on NHF therapy as a first-line oxygen therapy have a reduced hospital length of stay compared with children on standard-oxygen therapy. We also aim to investigate whether this leads to a reduced requirement for escalation of care. A within trial health economics evaluation will be performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, considering the heterogeneity of service users, health system, geographical and economical conditions and end implications for resource allocation from the payer’s perspective. The modelling will account for the opportunity cost and affordability of the health system payer. In addition, a decision analytical model will be developed to account for longer term cost-effectiveness modelling.</p>

                <p>The PARIS 2 trial will investigate if the use of NHF therapy in children presenting with AHRF will reduce the hospital length of stay. This will be achieved by comparing the use of early NHF therapy with standard-oxygen therapy.</p>

                <p><underline>The secondary objectives</underline> are to demonstrate if early use of NHF reduces the requirement to escalate therapy, reduces transfers to higher level of care such as intensive, reduces the proportion of adverse events, to demonstrate ex post within-trial and ex ante longer term cost-effectiveness of high-flow therapy, to show reduced length of oxygen therapy and to ascertain comfort levels of children on high-flow.</p>

                <title>Definitions</title>
                <p>AHRF is defined as children presenting to ED with increased work of breathing due to respiratory disease, having an ongoing oxygen requirement to maintain Transcutaneous Oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) ≥90/92% (dependent on hospitals’ current threshold for administering oxygen, which can either be 90% or 92%) with increased respiratory rate ≥35 breaths/min and requiring hospital admission. The syndrome of AHRF represents an array of clinical diagnoses such as pneumonia, pneumonitis, acute lower respiratory tract infection, reactive airways (asthma) including small numbers with bronchiolitis older than 12 months of age. For the purpose of this study there will be two groups of patients investigated with a <bold><italic>pragmatic and point of care definition,</italic></bold> which includes clinically diagnosed: (a) <italic>wheeze</italic> (<italic>obstructive) and reactive airway disease</italic> with an oxygen requirement and (b) <italic>absent wheeze (non-obstructive) and parenchymal lung disease</italic> with an oxygen requirement during hospital admission (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Consent considerations</title>
                <p>One of the primary challenges in performing research in an emergency setting is the inability to obtain true informed consent. Frequently, parents and guardians are not initially available when their child is brought into the ED. Furthermore, when parents or guardians are present, they are often too distressed by the situation to comprehend study procedures and there is not enough time to obtain informed consent.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref> In all participating centres, prospective consent will be obtained from the parent or guardian where possible. When prospective consent is not possible or practical, and local legislation allows, patients will be randomised to the study and written informed consent to remain in the study will be sought from parents and guardians at the earliest possible time after emergency stabilisation of the child (consent-to-continue). Data for children whose parents and guardians do not wish for their child to remain in the study will be handled according to local hospital policies, and the data will not be available for analysis.</p>
                <p>This study has ethical approval for consent-to-continue for participating Australian sites by the Children’s Health Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/15/QRCH/159) and Ethics Committee of The University of Queensland (2016001491). For sites in New Zealand approval has been received for prospective consent (Health and Disability Ethics Committee, 17/NTA/135) as the legislation of New Zealand does not allow delayed consent.</p>

If AHRF (SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90/92% in room air) symptoms persist and hospital admission is required, then the patient will become eligible and will be randomised to standard-oxygen or NHF therapy. Excluded are children as per <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>. The study protocol prescribes the oxygen delivery and weaning method only (standard-oxygen or NHF therapy). A web-based randomisation schedule with a block size of 10 will be used with patients allocated 1:1 and stratified by site and by obstructive and reactive airway disease versus non-obstructive and parenchymal lung disease as defined by the admitting clinician.</p>

                <p><underline>Treatment protocol for NHF therapy:</underline> NHF is set according to weight (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>) using the AIRVO-2 system (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, New Zealand). For children presenting with SpO<sub>2</sub> between 85% to 89/91% inclusive, the Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) is initially set at 0.21 and SpO<sub>2</sub> observed for 10 min. If SpO<sub>2</sub> remains &lt;90/92% after 10 min then FiO<sub>2</sub> is increased and titrated to achieve SpO<sub>2</sub> ≥90/92%. If SpO<sub>2</sub> has improved to ≥90/92% then NHF therapy is continued in room air. For children presenting with SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;85% the FiO<sub>2</sub> is immediately increased in 5% increments to achieve SpO<sub>2</sub> ≥90/92%. FiO<sub>2</sub> is adjusted for all children to achieve and maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90/92% to 98% avoiding long periods of hyperoxia with SpO<sub>2</sub> of 100%. For any flow rates &gt;25 L/min the high-flow rates are increased gradually over 2 min and the patient observed in terms of his/her ability to tolerate NHF therapy. Age and flow specific nasal cannulas will be used.</p>

                  <p><underline>Feeding while on NHF therapy:</underline> A nasogastric tube (NGT) is not mandatory in the use of NHF therapy but it is encouraged in the patients aged less than 2 to 3 years if clinically indicated. Insertion of a NGT remains at the discretion of the attending clinician. In patients who do not receive a NGT and are stable and wish to breastfeed/drink and/or eat, the NHF therapy should be reduced to 2 L/min (low flow therapy) via the same nasal cannula. This can be achieved by decreasing the flow to 2 L/min and increasing the oxygen to 95% FiO<sub>2</sub> for a maximum of up to 20 min and then return the patient to the previous NHF therapy settings. Patients who have had a NGT inserted should be assessed as to whether they can be fed. The use of the NGT over oral feeding while a nasogastric tube is in situ is preferred to prevent the risk of aspiration. Nasogastric feeding can be bolus or continuous at the discretion of the attending physician. Many of these patients will have an intravenous line in situ. Children who do not tolerate nasogastric feeds will have intravenous hydration.</p>
                  <p><underline>Use of nebuliser and/or inhalation/burst therapy for NHF therapy patients</underline>: For the duration of inhalation/burst therapy, the NHF therapy will be stopped and nasal prongs removed (leaving wiggle pads in situ if applied) and administer the burst/inhalation therapy administered. This will allow for greater face-mask seal with the metered-dose inhaler via spacer if used. For nebulisers there is no need for additional oxygen via nasal prongs. After the inhalation/burst therapy is complete NHF therapy will be returned with previous settings.</p>

The tolerance level of placing nasal cannula with high flows in younger children, particularly the 1 to 4 year age group, is unknown. This RCT aims to additionally investigate the tolerance level of NHF therapy. A 100 mm unmarked visual analogue scale (VAS) will be used as a measurement instrument. Both the parent and the nurse caring for the patient will separately assess the intensity of respiratory patient-comfort level twice during admission: first, at 1 hour post commencement of oxygen therapy and second between 4 to 48 hours post commencement of oxygen therapy and document the comfort score that they believe the child is experiencing at that point in time. One end of the scale is marked with ‘no discomfort’ and the other end marked as ‘maximal imaginable discomfort’. The VAS will measure both standard-oxygen therapy and NHF therapy treatment arms for level of comfort.</p>

                <p>Study data will be obtained either directly from hospital records, electronic medical records or copies and entered after verification into the clinical research form (CRF). The investigators are responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility and timeliness of the data reported. All CRF and study documents will be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. The document/forms will be stored and locked away as per site specific requirements and regulations for each individual hospital. Ongoing surveillance and adherence to the study protocol will be monitored by the Coordinating Principal Investigator and the steering committee, who are meeting via teleconference at 3-monthly interval. All serious adverse events, protocol deviations and protocol violations will be submitted to the chief investigator and all serious adverse events and protocol violations will be submitted to the approving HREC and local Research Governance Offices (RGOs). All local regulatory process will be followed to ensure adherence to local governance requirements. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that has been used in the past for other respiratory trials will be used. The DSMB will consist of an experienced Data and Safety Monitoring Chair (DSMC), clinical expert, statistician and a secretariat. An interim analysis will be undertaken by the DSMB after 100 participants have been enrolled into the study but only analysed for safety aspects. This had already occurred at the time of the publication of this protocol and the DSMB recommended to continue the trial.</p>

                <p>The sample size calculation is based on a two-sided, randomised, parallel group trial design with total length of hospital stay as the primary outcome and survival analysis as the primary method of analysis. We consider a difference in length of hospital stay of at least half a day as clinically meaningful, however for the sample size calculation this will be reduced to 0.4 day to increase the sample size to adjust for the effect of clustering. Assuming a median length of hospital stay in the control therapy arm of 2 days (based on pilot data), compared with a median length of hospital stay in the NHF arm of 1.6 days, 5% level of significance and 90% power we require 1209 children. To allow for up to 20% non-compliance we require 1512 children in total; 756 in each treatment group. We estimate a 50% to 80% enrolment rate of eligible patients.</p>

Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to graphically describe and compare the primary outcome (length of hospital stay) as well as duration of oxygen therapy. Analyses of secondary binary outcomes will be based on X<sup>2</sup> test for proportions and the absolute difference between treatment groups will be reported as the risk difference with a 95% CI. An independent samples t-test will be used for normally distributed continuous measures; Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed continuous outcomes. Exploratory analyses will be conducted on the subset of patients who require escalation of treatment. These are conditional analyses that are not based on comparing complete randomised groups hence caution will be needed when interpreting the results. We plan to compare length of ICU stay between treatment groups for the subgroup of patients that are admitted to ICU. All analyses will be by intention-to-treat. Statistical significance is set at the 0.05 level.</p>

                <title>Health economics evaluation</title>
                <p>We will build an ex ante longer term decision analytical model and also undertake ex post within-trial modelling, to determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment compared with usual care. An appropriate bespoke health economics data collection tool will be developed to provide critical data for these models. Unit costs will be extracted from standard sources. To provide longer-term analysis, we will build a bespoke Decision Analytical Model to estimate cost-effectiveness under the horizon of 5 years. The model will be based on both aggregate resource, cost use and health state transitions data from literature, expert opinion, along with our newly collected data in the RCT. Models will include sensitivity analysis, and outputs will include cost-effectiveness acceptability curves – these will display the probability of cost-effectiveness at varying thresholds of net monetary benefit. Following a Markov chain modelling approach, we will use Monte Carlo simulation methods to incorporate the occurrence and timing of events. The main issue with such ex ante evaluation is uncertainty, and we will use standard bootstrap methods to account for this in our estimates. This will provide us with a sensitivity analysis of differences in potential costs depending on demographics and socioeconomic status. The model will be constructed and continuously updated with new data as it becomes available throughout the project. A standard within-trial cost utility analysis will be undertaken under the horizon of 5 days. This will compare costs and benefits in terms of resource use and quality adjusted life years gained. Resource use and travel data will be collected with the bespoke tool and the collated unit costs will be assigned to the resource utilisation to provide overall costs for both arms of the trial. Benefits will be assessed using appropriate quality of life instruments, for example EQ-5D-5L (developed by EuroQol) measuring Mobility; Self-care; Usual activity; Pain;
Anxiety/depression and the PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). The analysis will be from the healthcare provider perspective but with an additional societal perspective, to include for example, consumer travel costs. Probability sensitivity analysis will be provided to give the probability of cost-effectiveness at each threshold level of net monetary benefit. The data from this trial will then feed into our decision model, enhancing the model further with current and comparable data.</p>

                <title>Outcomes and significance</title>
                <p>Providing the hypothesis of the study can be proven, the following impact on future healthcare is expected: (i) Reduction in hospital length of stay for patients aged 1 to 4 years with AHRF, (ii) Reduction of transfers of patients aged 1 to 4 years with AHRF to specialist paediatric centres - ‘keeps patients in their regional hospitals’ and potentially gives the regional centres more autonomy in managing their patients with best respiratory practice, (iii) That early intervention reduces the number of patients requiring escalation of treatment, (iv) Reduction in healthcare costs and demonstration of cost-effectiveness of NHF therapy, (v) Potential to expand NHF therapy to older children with AHRF, (vi) Greater expansion of knowledge for nursing and medical staff on the use of NHF therapy and the benefits and non-benefits in this population of children, (vii) Informing the use of NHF therapy in less developed countries in this population of children and (viii) Development of strategies to implement NHF therapy safely in the described study population.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The intervention of high-flow therapy cannot be blinded and a certain clinician driven bias may occur. The escalation of care is driven by clinical criteria and judgement and there is the potential bias to favour one intervention over the other. However, our previous high-flow trial in bronchiolitis showed that this element was not cofounding the study outcomes.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

              <p>This large multicentre randomised trial will provide the much-needed high-grade evidence of the efficacy of NHF therapy compared with standard-oxygen in the ARHF children aged 1 to &lt;5 years. This study will also provide a unique opportunity to investigate the safety profile off high-flow in children with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. We will capture data on health resource use and quality of life and the results can be utilised to inform best practice in use of high-flow outside intensive care settings.</p>
