                  <p>Methamphetamine is often recreationally co-consumed with alcohol due to desirable off-target effects; however, the acute neurocognitive and subjective consequences of combined use are unclear.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>In a randomised, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, cross-over study design, the effects of acute oral methamphetamine (0.42 mg/kg) were assessed with and without low doses of alcohol (target 0.04% blood–alcohol concentration, BAC) on subjective intoxication, alertness, physiological outcomes and neurocognition during the ascending and descending phases of the BAC curve. Sixteen healthy adults (mean age = 30.4 years, SD ± 4.4, 67% male) completed four experimental sessions over 4 weeks involving a one-week washout period.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Cardiovascular measures [heart rate (beats/minute), blood pressure (mmHg)] were predictably elevated following methamphetamine, but unaffected by combined alcohol use. Methamphetamine and alcohol produce divergent effects on subjective alertness and sedation across time, yet their combination produced predominantly sustained stimulative effects independent of the biphasic alcohol curve. At a peak BAC of 0.029%, alcohol alone impaired performance across most functional neurocognitive domains relative to placebo and methamphetamine only, and the addition of methamphetamine attenuated these effects. Methamphetamine alone produced isolated improvement in psychomotor speed consistent with peak drug effects.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>Methamphetamine combined with alcohol does not substantially alter the physiological or metabolic profile compared to either drug alone. Strong stimulative effects of methamphetamine appear to mask the biphasic sedative and performance effects of low doses of alcohol, which may underlie motivations for co-consumption in recreational settings and increase propensity for harm.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Methamphetamine, a potent central nervous system stimulant, is an indirect agonist at the noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin (5-HT) receptor sites (<xref rid="bibr2-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Cruickshank &amp; Dyer, 2009</xref>). It is one of the most common clandestinely and illegally manufactured, trafficked and abused amphetamine-type stimulant in the world, and its use is associated with increasing social, economic and health burden (<xref rid="bibr26-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2020</xref>). Despite this, explicit examination of methamphetamine-induced effects on pertinent behavioural and neurocognitive domains is limited. Of the few studies that are available, evidence of an inverted U-shaped concentration–effect relationship suggests that while low to moderate doses of methamphetamine may have no (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Ermakova et al., 2014</xref>) or only select beneficial effects on functional neurocognition (<xref rid="bibr13-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2012b</xref>), these effects become maladaptive at higher doses and during tasks of greater complexity (<xref rid="bibr17-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Narayan et al., 2021</xref>). Recreationally, however, methamphetamine is rarely (if ever) consumed in isolation; yet even fewer studies have explored the relevant neurocognitive and subjective consequences of the comorbid use of methamphetamine with other substances such as alcohol.</p>
              <p>Methamphetamine is frequently co-consumed with alcohol in recreational settings among occasional (<xref rid="bibr30-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2007</xref>) and frequent stimulant users (<xref rid="bibr28-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Combined use may enhance desirable substance-specific properties and induce additive and/or synergistic pharmacological effects (<xref rid="bibr25-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2019</xref>). Due to opposing mechanisms of action and mutually inflammatory properties, combined use can also amplify respective deleterious properties and increase propensity for toxicity (<xref rid="bibr25-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2019</xref>). Over one-third of individuals admitted to an emergency department for trauma will have measurable concentrations of both methamphetamine and alcohol in their system (<xref rid="bibr10-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Isoardi et al., 2019</xref>), and the combined use of these substances is of increasing concern for road safety (<xref rid="bibr9-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Hayley et al., 2022</xref>). To our knowledge, only two small laboratory studies exist which examine the physiological and behavioural effects of combined methamphetamine and alcohol use. Under both acute (<xref rid="bibr16-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Mendelson et al., 1995</xref>) and repeated (<xref rid="bibr12-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2012a</xref>) protocols, individuals indicate higher self-reported ‘good drug effect’ relative to either substance alone, providing some evidence for potential <italic toggle="yes">incentives</italic> for their combined use; however, broader functional neurocognitive and relevant subjective effects (separate to craving) remain poorly defined. While acute methamphetamine administration reduces feelings of alcohol intoxication (<xref rid="bibr16-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Mendelson et al., 1995</xref>) and alcohol-induced performance deficits in a divided attention task (<xref rid="bibr12-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2012a</xref>), these studies are somewhat limited by the target populations (high frequency stimulant user cohorts) and use of fixed dosing paradigm, which may mask the magnitude of effects, particularly among other user groups.</p>
              <p>This study aimed to examine the effects of oral methamphetamine alone and in combination with low doses of alcohol on subjective intoxication and neurocognitive performance in healthy volunteers with limited prior exposure to methamphetamine to better characterise potential interactions.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>This trial used a randomised, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, double-blind, four-way within-subjects design with a minimum washout period of 1 week between study visits. Each participant received 0.42 mg/kg methamphetamine and vodka drink (with matched placebo capsule or drink) in a randomised order. Study visits occurred at the same time each week to control for any circadian variation in performance. Order of administration and treatment combination was determined via computer-generated randomisation software. Researchers conducting the study were blinded and were not involved in generating the randomisation schedule nor allocating participants to different drug conditions. The study was registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN: 12618000629235) and was approved by the Swinburne University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC: 20210770-8822).</p>

                  <p>A total of 21 participants aged between 21 and 40 years and who self-reported previous recreational use (lifetime history, less than 2 times/month) of amphetamine-type substances and who weighed less than 100 kg were recruited (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/02698811231179805" ext-link-type="uri">Appendix 1</ext-link>). Individuals who reported current use of any medication for the treatment of a medical condition (except of oral contraceptives in women or treatment for benign conditions); who indicated a current or past diagnosis of physical, gastrointestinal, neurological or psychiatric condition, personal history of head-injuries or loss of consciousness (determined via self-report and confirmed in clinical interview) or who returned a blood pressure reading above 160/90 were excluded. Female participants were required to submit a negative pregnancy test at the start of each study visit.</p>

                    <p>The active treatment was 0.42 mg/kg methamphetamine hydrochloride (purity 99.8 ± 1.3%). Weighted doses were rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g. weight of 74 kg × 0.42 mg = 31.08 mg, provided 30 mg). Raw product (batch numbers 14-D-12 and 19-D-01) was compounded into 5, 10 and 20 mg size #00 opaque capsules with microcrystalline cellulose filler by an independent compounding chemist. Identical matched placebo capsules comprised microcrystalline cellulose only. Methamphetamine oral fluid concentrations were measured at ~40 min and 3-h after consumption using the Quantisal Oral Fluid Collection Device (IMMUNALYSISTM).</p>
                    <p>Methamphetamine analysis was carried out by Forensic Science South Australia, per the method described in <xref rid="bibr21-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Rositano et al.’s study (2016)</xref> with some modification. All samples were analysed in duplicate, and the extraction automated on a Perkin Elmer Janus Liquid Handling Platform (Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia). Calibration curves were generated by spiking a 1:3 mixture of human oral fluid (Golden West Diagnostics, LLC) and oral fluid collection buffer (Statsure Diagnostic Systems Inc., Brooklyn, New York, United States) at 5–250 ng/mL methamphetamine (Cerilliant, Round Rock, Texas, United States) and D5-methamphetamine (Cerilliant, Round Rock, Texas, United States) internal standard spiked at a concentration of 50 ng/mL. Samples (100 µL) were diluted with aqueous ammonia (8%, 80 µL) and internal standard (20 µL, 250 ng/mL), then loaded onto the SLE sorbent (Biotage Isolute<sup>®</sup> Uppsala, Sweden, SLE+200 96-well plates). After 5 min absorption the samples were eluted with methyl t-butyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia, 900 µL) into a 96-well collection plate having glass inserts containing 50 µL aqueous formic acid (25%). The eluant was evaporated and reconstituted in methanol (80 µL, LiChrosolv<sup>®</sup>, Sigma Aldrich, Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia). Collection plates were capped and centrifuged (2000 rpm, 5 min) then transferred to a Shimadzu Nexera LC system [Shimadzu Scientific Instruments (Oceania) Pty. Ltd. Rydalmere, NSW, Australia] fitted with a Restek Ultrabiphenyl (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, United States) (3 µm × 50 mm × 2.1 mm) column and Phenomenex (Torrance, California, United States) 2.1 mm PFP guard cartridge. The mobile phase was a gradient of acetonitrile (Optima LCMS grade, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, New Hampshire, United States) and 0.1% formic acid (Optima, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, New Hampshire, United States) over 6 min with a flowrate of 0.5 mL/min. LC/MS analysis was performed on a SCIEX QTrap 5500 mass spectrometer (Mt Waverley, Victoria, Australia) in positive ion mode with scheduled multiple reaction monitoring of three transitions m/z 150/119, m/z 150/91, m/z 150/65 with m/z 150/119 used for quantitation and confirmation of identification. Method validation included replicate spikes at 7.5, 125 and 300 ng/mL over 3 days giving overall inter- and intra-day accuracy of less than 15% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 63) and relative standard deviation of 4%. Calibration was linear (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.999) with 1/x weighting without forcing through zero. The lower and upper limits of quantitation were 5 and 250 µg/L, respectively. Any samples above this range were diluted and reanalysed. Reported results are as determined from the buffer-diluted oral fluid samples.</p>

                  <p>On the first visit, eligibility was confirmed and participants who met inclusion criteria completed a training session on all performance tasks. Once completed, approval for inclusion was confirmed by the study physician, and participants were booked for their consecutive four-visit dosing protocol over 4 weeks. <xref rid="fig1-02698811231179805" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> displays an overview of the study schedule on testing days.

Alcohol and caffeine were prohibited for 12 h, and participants were instructed to have the same light meal no later than 2 h prior to each study visit to control for variability in gastric absorption of the study treatments (<xref rid="bibr27-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Vinarov et al., 2021</xref>). Participants were provided with a combination of capsules and a drink according to the scheduled treatment allocation. Approximately 30 min after dosing, participants completed the first B-BAES questionnaire and first cognitive assessment suite. The second B-BAES was completed at approximately 1-h post-dosing, along with the first KSS. The third B-BAES, second KSS and final cognitive suite were completed at ~2 h post-dosing, and the final B-BAES was completed at approximately 2.5 h post-dosing. Participants were prohibited from driving to/from the testing visit (and for 24-h post-testing) and were provided a taxi voucher upon site departure.</p>

                  <p>A linear mixed model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation was used to examine the effects of condition (placebo, alcohol, methamphetamine, methamphetamine and alcohol), time and their interaction on neurocognitive and subjective outcomes. Using the likelihood-ratio statistic to determine the most parsimonious model, compound symmetry was considered best fit. Condition and time were entered into as the repeated factor, and separate models were built to examine each outcome. Where a main effect was observed, post-hoc paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons were conducted to examine condition and time differences. Considering the potential effect of sex differences in pharmacokinetics of alcohol and alcohol-induced dopamine release in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="bibr3-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Baraona et al., 2001</xref>), a bivariate analysis was performed on performance data as a function of sex.

              <p>Acute weighted oral doses of methamphetamine, when used alone or in combination with low doses of alcohol, produce prototypical physiological and subjective drug effects but do not reliably affect higher-order neurocognitive skills relative to alcohol-use alone. Sustained subjective stimulative effects and absence of additive performance deficits in the combined condition suggest at least some masking of biphasic alcohol effects over time, which may underlie motivations for co-consumption in recreational settings and increase propensity for harm.</p>
              <p>Even at low doses (mean BAC 0.029%), alcohol impaired performance in tasks of psychomotor speed and sustained attention, but not working memory. Impairment in these functional domains supports low-effect thresholds for alcohol intoxication starting from a very low BAC (<xref rid="bibr5-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Dry et al., 2012</xref>) and underscores established implications for relevant safety-sensitive behaviours, including driving (<xref rid="bibr7-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Garrisson et al., 2021</xref>). Lack of clear effect of time-on-task performance despite clear subjective sedating-type effects of alcohol consumption may more closely reflect the constrained BAC peak and rapid elimination in biological matrices when used at these low doses, rather than a true lack of effect <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic>. While the average BAC was marginally lower than the target, it fell within the intended range, and evidence of significant objective and subjective outcomes (stimulant, sedative) confirm the presence of a biphasic (ascending and descending) alcohol concentration–effect curve (<xref rid="bibr11-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>Previous research has found that methamphetamine produced isolated improvement in psychomotor response speed during a working memory task and improved time-on-task performance proportionate to expected pharmacodynamic properties (<xref rid="bibr2-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Cruickshank and Dyer, 2009</xref>). Low-moderate doses of amphetamine-type stimulants improve select sustained attention and vigilance (<xref rid="bibr23-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Silber et al., 2006</xref>) and reduce psychomotor speed/response time (<xref rid="bibr17-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Narayan et al., 2021</xref>); however, some studies cite a lack of effect (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Ermakova et al., 2014</xref>) or else note that these beneficial effects appear to dissipate when higher doses are consumed, particularly in tasks of complex higher-order functioning (inverted-U; <xref rid="bibr4-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Dolder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Naylor et al., 1985</xref>). Long-term or heavy patterns of use are also associated with enduring cognitive change, which may reflect alterations in brain morphology even in the absence of acute intoxication (<xref rid="bibr19-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2001</xref>). Considering the overrepresentation of methamphetamine-related harm, it is possible that more severe negative functional performance effects more closely reflect recreational patterns of consumption that are difficult to replicate experimentally (<xref rid="bibr20-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">O’Malley et al., 2022</xref>). Recreationally, crystalline methamphetamine is typically consumed in binge-like patterns over a period of several hours or even days and is more commonly consumed via inhalation (smoking) or intravenously (injection) (<xref rid="bibr15-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">McKetin et al., 2021</xref>). In its powdered form, it is more likely to be consumed intranasally (snorting). Additional work is therefore warranted to discern the effects of longer-term methamphetamine consumption to discern potential interactions of use patterns and safety-relevant indices.</p>
              <p>Isolated impairment in the alcohol-only condition, relative to the combined methamphetamine and alcohol condition on measures of vigilance, and a general observation of preserved accuracy of performance without compromised speed of response may reflect ability of the psychostimulant to protect against gradual performance deterioration; however, these results were somewhat limited in scope. Nevertheless, the stimulant properties of methamphetamine were not altered by the biphasic effects of low doses of ethanol, and thus it is possible that there is at least some protective effect of methamphetamine against gradual performance degradation, even after lower doses of alcohol are consumed. The longevity of subjective effects and absence of clear sedation in the combined methamphetamine and alcohol condition, even beyond the expected half-life of alcohol and in contrast to known concentration curves, may increase the likelihood of repeated dosing (consuming more alcohol) for a longer duration. Indeed, methamphetamine pharmacokinetics were not altered by the concurrent administration of ethanol, which is consistent with previous acute dosing studies at similar doses (<xref rid="bibr16-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Mendelson et al., 1995</xref>). Amphetamine (including methamphetamine) and alcohol are often found in combination in cases of serious road trauma (<xref rid="bibr9-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Hayley et al., 2022</xref>), and polydrug use is associated with higher odds of risky road-user behaviour even in laboratory settings (such as running red light; <xref rid="bibr24-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Simons et al., 2012</xref>). From a signal detection perspective, we show greater ratio of false alarms/misses on the vigilance task following alcohol usage, but not in the combined use condition. More work is needed to explore how co-use of these substances may translate to these types of operational errors during driving. It is possible that reduced feelings of intoxication, coupled with similar drug bioavailability and metabolism, contribute to real and sustained risk due to incongruence between perceived and actual effects, which influence these outcomes.</p>
              <p>The small sample size is a notable limitation of the present study; however, the closely controlled design, coupled with multiple testing timepoints per experimental session for each treatment condition, ensures high data quality and expands a very limited research area. To date, only two studies have implemented a comparable combined methamphetamine and alcohol-dosing paradigm (<xref rid="bibr16-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Mendelson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2012a</xref>), each having yielded a much smaller evaluable sample than examined here. We overcame some key limitations of previous research by ensuring a non-smoking paradigm (<xref rid="bibr12-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2012a</xref>) and by mirroring weighted doses of treatment(s) used in previous behavioural studies of methamphetamine (<xref rid="bibr23-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Silber et al., 2006</xref>). As an acute dosing paradigm was used, we are unable to comment on the potential interactive effects of these substances as they may be replicated under repeated and/or chronic dosing schedules or following delayed intake. As treatments were consumed simultaneously, we recognise that we are unable to generalise to a more naturalistic environment whereby individuals might consume alcohol at a later stage (i.e. 1–2 h after) to counteract the more negative stimulative properties of methamphetamine. Such laboratory research would provide valuable insight into drug effects under the most precise pharmacological conditions possible; however, this approach would need to be considered in terms of what is methodologically and ethically acceptable. Given known sex differences in the physiological response to both psychostimulants and alcohol (<xref rid="bibr3-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Baraona et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr8-02698811231179805" ref-type="bibr">Franconi et al., 2007</xref>), and evidence of select sex-related cognitive effects found in this study, future research should also include sex as a primary factor to determine the magnitude of main effects and potential interactions. Subjective drug effects (B-BAES) were compared to placebo and were not evaluated at baseline. This precludes examination of condition-specific differences under these conditions, and we are unable to assess change from baseline. Notwithstanding these limitations, the present results provide the most robust examination on the neurocognitive effects of methamphetamine alone, and in combination with alcohol to date.</p>
              <p>Despite reductions in the global consumption of alcohol, rates of methamphetamine used continue to increase. Polydrug use represents an increasing concern for safety, and discerning potential interactive effects on performance and behaviour is critical for informing effective harm reduction strategies. Dissociation between these subjective effects and objective effects appears partially supported, whereby the stimulative effects of methamphetamine may mask some of the biphasic sedative properties of even low doses of alcohol. In practical terms, this may potentiate the reinforcing and hazardous effects of each drug and increasing the propensity for harm.</p>
