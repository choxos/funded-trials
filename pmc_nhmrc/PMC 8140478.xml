                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The promotion of healthy eating is a public health priority. Poor dietary behaviours, including low fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) consumption are of particular concern among children. Novel nutrition promotion strategies are needed to improve F&amp;V consumption. Sustainability education could be used to support nutrition education within the school context. The purpose of this paper is to report the protocol for impact and process evaluation of the school-based <italic>Food Education and Sustainability Training</italic> (FEAST) program, designed to educate children about sustainability, food waste and nutrition, using hands-on cooking activities.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A pragmatic, parallel, cluster non-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-measures, will be implemented among 20 primary schools (10 intervention vs 10 wait-list-control) within NSW, Australia, involving children in Grades 5–6. FEAST is a curriculum-aligned program, delivered as a 1.5-h lesson/week, for a 10-week unit of inquiry, incorporating theory and cooking. FEAST was developed using theoretical frameworks which included Social Cognitive Theory and the Precede-Proceed Planning model. Primary outcomes include children’s self-reported F&amp;V intakes (serves/day). Food literacy constructs such as: nutrition knowledge, food preparation and cooking skills, self-efficacy and behaviours, food waste knowledge and behaviours and food production knowledge, will be assessed as secondary outcomes. Process evaluation will assess program reach, adoption, implementation, maintenance, satisfaction and perceived benefits by teachers and students. An online survey (including quantitative and qualitative questions) was developed for administration at baseline (impact evaluation) and immediately post-intervention (impact and process evaluation). Intervention effects on quantitative study outcomes will be estimated with ​generalised linear mixed models, including random effects and will follow the intention-to-treat principles. Open-ended questions embedded within the surveys will be analysed qualitatively using content and thematic analyses.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Results from this trial will provide valuable information on the value of adding environmental sustainability strategies to nutrition education in schools. Results will inform the design of future research and programs focused on primary-school children’s nutrition, sustainability-related behaviours and experiential school-based interventions.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par31">Diet is considered to be the single most important behavioural risk factor that can be improved, to have a significant positive impact on population health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to the continued high incidence of diet-related health problems, such as overweight, obesity, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the promotion of healthy eating continues to be a public health priority globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">Intakes of fruits and vegetables (F&amp;V) have become a proxy marker for healthy diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Poor dietary behaviours, that include low F&amp;V consumption are of particular concern among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] children are not consuming the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables. Only 6.0% of Australian children consume the recommended two servings of fruit and five servings of vegetables per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">Most interventions aimed at improving children’s dietary intakes have been school-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or community-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given that children spend most of their formative years in school, and many of their nutrition behaviours are influenced by, and established within this environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], schools have become an obvious setting for implementation of interventions to improve the consumption of F&amp;V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As a result, teachers have become the key agents for promoting health and nutrition within schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">Systematic reviews examining nutrition education programs have revealed that school-based interventions produced mixed results, with small to moderate increases in F&amp;V intakes among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with experiential learning strategies (such as school gardens, cooking skills, or food preparation) being associated with the largest effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although school-based interventions offer a unique opportunity to educate children in health promoting activities, children’s dietary intakes still remain suboptimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and more research is needed to identify novel, scalable nutrition promotion strategies, to improve F&amp;V consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">The EAT-Lancet report argued that health and environmental sustainability considerations could be used to support nutrition education within the school context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Growing evidence suggests that dietary patterns with low environmental impacts are also compatible with good health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As such, sustainable food initiatives are accompanying nutrition education and health promotion programs in some school settings, such as the: <italic>Farm-to-School</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and <italic>Healthy Planet, Healthy Youth</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] programs in the US; the <italic>Farm to Cafeteria</italic> program in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; and the <italic>Food for Life</italic> program in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">An evaluation of the <italic>Healthy Planet, Healthy Youth</italic> program found that it did not produce significant increases in F&amp;V consumption among students compared to control schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, the <italic>Food for Life</italic> program, revealed that students were significantly more likely to consume more servings of F&amp;V, than students in comparison schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The <italic>Farm to Cafeteria</italic> program which was evaluated by project teams involved in the funding and implementation of the program found that it increased preferences towards, consumption of a greater variety of, and willingness to try new F&amp;V, among students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A 2008 review (<italic>n</italic> = 15), found that students participating in the <italic>Farm-to-School</italic> program increased their F&amp;V intakes, however, authors noted only one study came from a peer-reviewed journal, with very few assessments involving control groups or statistical analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In a current systematic review of the <italic>Farm-to-School</italic> program (<italic>n</italic> = 21), authors concluded that increases in F&amp;V consumption among students was unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which is at odds with the earlier review. One major limitation, identified by those review authors, was the failure to quantify that program’s fidelity, leading to questions about the feasibility of incorporating the <italic>Farm-to-School</italic> program within the classroom curricula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">Despite the promise of sustainable food education initiatives, there remains relatively little empirical evidence of the effectiveness of such programs, nor their acceptability among children and teachers. This would suggest that further evaluative research is needed in programs that integrate sustainable food initiatives alongside nutrition education within the school context. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to evaluate an established nutrition and sustainability education program that includes experiential activities. The <italic>Food Education and Sustainability Training</italic> (FEAST) program incorporates all three of these components: nutrition; sustainability; and experiential activities. FEAST is also focused on food waste, a key component of sustainability education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and includes food waste awareness (local and global), ways to reduce food waste, and ways to rescue foods (that would otherwise be wasted and how to turn them into new repurposed recipe ideas). (Refer to Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for comparisons between the components of FEAST and the sustainable food initiatives discussed above.)</p>
              <p id="Par38">This trial will evaluate OzHarvest’s FEAST program in primary schools in one Australian state i.e. New South Wales (NSW). FEAST was launched in 2018 and since then has been delivered in over 170 primary schools (<italic>n</italic> = 8749 students) across all six Australian states, as well as the Australian Capital Territory. FEAST was designed to educate children about sustainability, food waste and nutrition, using hands-on cooking and inquiry-based learning.</p>
              <p id="Par39">This paper presents the protocol for the impact and process evaluation of the FEAST program. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the immediate effectiveness of the program on increasing F&amp;V consumption among primary-school-aged children. The secondary objectives of this trial, will be to assess F&amp;V variety intakes and the following food literacy constructs: nutrition knowledge, food preparation and cooking skills, self-efficacy and behaviours (i.e. preparing food, following recipes, and frequency of cooking dinner); food waste knowledge and behaviours (i.e. willingness to eat ‘imperfect’ F&amp;V, and daily food lunch box waste behaviours); as well as food production knowledge (i.e. understanding the ‘farm to plate’ concept). Furthermore, a process evaluation will be conducted to assess program: reach (students and teachers); adoption (by schools); implementation (training of teachers, adherence by students and teachers, facilitators and barriers); maintenance (intention by students and teachers); satisfaction (of students and teachers); and perceived benefits (by teachers for their students).</p>

              <p id="Par40">The study methods for Version 1 of this protocol (as of 22nd December 2020), will be reported in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items for Clinical Trials) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Ethics approval has been obtained from an Australian University Human Ethics Advisory Group (HEAG-H 31_2020) as well as from the NSW Department of Education (SERAP 2019163). The FEAST trial has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12620001347954). Principals and teachers will provide written informed consent and parents will provide opt-out consent, if they do not wish for their child to participate in the collection of data during the implementation of the FEAST program by OzHarvest.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par41">This study will employ a pragmatic approach, involving a parallel, cluster, non-randomized controlled trial (NRCT) with pre- and post-measures. It will involve 20 primary schools (10 intervention vs 10 wait-list control) with children in Grades 5–6, aged 10–12 years, within NSW, Australia. Schools that have self-selected to undertake the FEAST program in 2021 will be invited to participate in this trial.</p>
                <p id="Par42">OzHarvest, a not-for-profit community-based, food-rescue organization, has designed the FEAST program and has been training teachers to implement the program within the classroom setting, in Australian primary-schools, since 2018. The intervention runs for one school term, approximately 10 weeks. Schools participating in the FEAST program during Term 2 (19 April-25 June) of the 2021 scholastic school year will be invited to act as the intervention schools for this trial. Pre- and post-intervention surveys will be issued in the first and last weeks of term, respectively.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Schools participating in the FEAST program during Term 3 (12 July-17 September) and Term 4 (5 October-17 December), will be invited to act as the comparator group (i.e. wait-list control schools). The wait-list control schools will continue with their usual academic programs and will complete the surveys at the same time as the intervention schools (i.e. during the first and last weeks of Term 2). When the wait-list control schools undertake the FEAST program during their chosen school term (Terms 3 or 4), they will be issued with the post-intervention surveys again (third data collection point [T3]), only if they are willing to complete the surveys for their own interest. Previous experience suggests obtaining a third wave of follow-up data from schools is challenging and hence this will not be compulsory. Given variations in the timing of administration and likely low response rates, these data will be used for school feedback only, and not included in the trial.</p>

                <p id="Par44">Government and non-government primary schools in urban or rural locations in the state of NSW, in Australia, who have registered to undertake the FEAST program in 2021, will be eligible to participate in this trial. Students in Grades 5, 6 or composite Grade 5/6 classes (combined Grade 5 and 6), who have access to a school computer and a school email address, will be eligible to participate. Schools that cater exclusively to children with special needs or particular health conditions and/or schools that have already undertaken the FEAST program previously, will be excluded from trial participation.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par45">The FEAST program was developed through a collaborative process involving OzHarvest staff (with backgrounds in education, nutrition, and sustainability) with inputs from the education sector (i.e. primary school teachers interviewed in focus groups to provide feedback on the program). It incorporated both the Precede-Proceed Planning model (PPM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The PPM incorporates an ecological approach to an intervention which includes planning and evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This model is widely used in health promotion, as it acknowledges individual health behaviour, as well as community needs and wants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Guided by SCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], the FEAST program components were designed based on concepts of behavioural capability, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and observational learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The use of observational learning or role modelling concepts will be incorporated into classroom cooking activities which are designed to be facilitated by teachers, parents/caregivers, and/or community volunteers that will participate in the practical components of the program. Curricular components include activities that target knowledge and skills with the intent to change behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par46">FEAST is a primary-school, classroom-based, curriculum-aligned program, that uses inquiry-based approaches to learning, which are student-centred and interactive and recommended by the NSW Department of Education as a strategy that can positively impact student learning outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Inquiry-based learning focuses on investigation and problem-solving, and when applied to primary education to stimulate scientific inquiry, has been found to produce positive feedback from students, as it increased interest and motivation in science classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par47">OzHarvest provides training, resources and support to teachers to deliver a recommended 1.5-h lesson/week, for a 10-week unit of inquiry (incorporating 10 theory and six practical activities) within the classroom setting. The FEAST program has been integrated with lessons mapped to the Australian Curriculum, embracing Grade 5–6 key learning areas (KLAs) i.e. English [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]; STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]; general capabilities (Literacy, Numeracy, Information and Communication Technologies, Critical and Creative Thinking, Personal and Social Capability and Intercultural Understanding) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; and the cross-curriculum priority of sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. FEAST has been aligned with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and state/territory-based healthy eating strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], with all recipes including either fruits and/or vegetables (which are also the two most wasted food groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]). The program includes a range of educational resources designed to assist in the delivery of the theory and practical components as outlined in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The lesson plan topics are outlined in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and the practical guide components are outlined in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par48">Grade 5–6 classroom teachers from the schools that volunteer to participate in the FEAST program, will be invited for a training workshop at OzHarvest offices. A Professional Learning Program will be delivered over six hours of face-to-face training. During the training day, two FEAST education team members will train the teachers in food preparation and cooking skills (making the hot and cold recipes designed for the FEAST program). To assist the teachers and students during the class practical components, teachers will be provided with instructions and resources to seek volunteers throughout the school community such as parents/caregivers, grandparents, and/or school staff etc. Trained volunteers will also be available through OzHarvest, to assist during the practical components. It is recommended that the teachers organize at least one adult per five students, for each of the practical sessions, in addition to themselves.</p>
                <p id="Par49">A 3-h NESA accredited online teacher training version of the FEAST program was developed for schools in regional and remote areas of NSW (as defined in the <italic>‘school facts location identified’</italic>), which is published on the <italic>MySchool</italic> website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This can also be used by teachers that are unable to attend the 6-h face-to-face training, due to additional circumstances, including COVID19 restrictions.</p>
                <p id="Par50">The teachers using the online training have the option to work through the training module at their own pace. Teacher instructions on how to use the online learning resources and adapt them to their students’ needs have also been included in the online training module. Lesson plans; how to conduct the practical cooking sessions with instructional videos on good cooking techniques for making some of the recipes at home, including parent roles; and access to all of the same resources as the face-to-face training are available through the online module. Email and phone support from the FEAST education team will also be available to the teachers undertaking the online training. The online training will also be used in the event that COVID19 restrictions prevent face-to-face training in 2021.</p>
                <p id="Par51">Strategies to improve adherence to the FEAST program include: accredited teacher training program; a complete curriculum package for the teachers; lessons plans mapped to the Australian Curriculum, KLAs (English and STEM), general capabilities, and cross-curriculum priority area of sustainability; activity booklets for students with answer booklets for teachers; training of OzHarvest volunteers to assist in the practical activities (subject to COVID19 regulations); as well as open communication (phone and/or email) between the FEAST education team and teachers during implementation, to provide support.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Strategies to support data collection involve: training the teachers to use the REDcap platform (used for data collection) and to familiarise them with survey questions; training OzHarvest volunteers to assist in data collection; a video by Ronni Kahn (OzHarvest CEO and founder) thanking students and teachers for participating in the FEAST program and encouraging them to complete the post-FEAST surveys; and two email reminders to teachers to complete surveys. The primary investigator (PI) will also assist during teacher training sessions and she or a trained OzHarvest volunteer will be available to assist teachers in data collection, pre- and post-FEAST (subject to COVID19 regulations). Every school that participates in this trial, will be rewarded with a gift voucher, worth $100.00 AUD, if the students complete both pre- and post-FEAST surveys and the teachers complete the program evaluation survey. Additionally, schools will be eligible to win one of five prizes (worth $100.00 AUD) for the best School Cookbook produced. The cookbooks will be judged by the FEAST education and research teams.</p>
                <p id="Par53">OzHarvest has secured funding for the FEAST program from governmental, corporate and philanthropic sponsors, to cover the costs of the program, including teacher training, curriculum package and cooking equipment. This is offered to schools with an Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) below the average ICSEA value of 1000 and to schools that are in regional or remote Australia, that are interested in participating in the program. The ICSEA information is published on <italic>MySchool</italic> website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, depending on the funding offer some schools will need to fund the purchase of the food/ingredients required for the cooking activities or ask for support from local businesses. The estimated cost of the food required for 30 students to undertake the six cooking activities is $300.00 AUD. Schools with an ICSEA above 1000, will need to cover the costs of the entire FEAST program for themselves (estimated to cost $4000.00 AUD).</p>

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only 6.3% of children meet their recommended intake of five vegetables/day, with an average intake of only two serves/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, a more conservative level of two serves/day will be used to assess changes in proportion of students consuming vegetables. For analyses involving proportions, intakes of F&amp;V will be dichotomized to 0–1 serves/day verses ≥2 serves/day. These outcomes will be calculated using the same two questions used for the primary outcomes.</p>
                    <p id="Par67">Vegetable variety (number of different types of vegetables consumed yesterday), fruit variety (number of different types of fruits consumed yesterday), and the mean number of the variety of the different F&amp;V consumed, will be calculated (with 95% CI), as well as the proportion (in percentages %) of students consuming these F&amp;V. To capture variety of F&amp;V eaten by children, two questions were taken from the <italic>Modified Child Nutrition Questionnaire</italic> (MCNQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], which was designed to assess dietary patterns in Australian children aged 9–13 years, and has face/content validity, criterion/concurrent/predictive validity and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. However, there has been an addition of ‘other’ under the list of fruits and vegetables listed in these questions, with the opportunity to state which ‘other’ F&amp;V children consume. This was used in order to capture the different varieties of F&amp;V consumed by children from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. The inclusion of questions that are sensitive to populations that are CALD, was one of the lessons learnt from the FEAST pilot study, given the schools that participated in the pilot, had a high percentage of students that were from diverse ethnic backgrounds, as well as a small percentage of students from Indigenous backgrounds.</p>
                    <p id="Par68">Nutrition knowledge will be calculated as the proportion (%) of students reporting knowing the recommended intakes of fruit and vegetable serves/day.

The four questions for this outcome were modified from one published study investigating food waste behaviours among children in Western Australian upper primary and lower secondary schools (Grades 5–8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, this survey has not been validated to date. Most validated measures for school mealtime waste involve observations and assessments of food plate waste, such as digital photography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This is not an option in this study, as Australian primary schools do not have national school lunch programs as they do in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], instead Australian children are more likely to bring their lunch from home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] or purchase it from the school canteen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Also, a food waste audit was not feasible as a more intensive program of research would be required and is beyond the time and resources available for this trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par101">The implementation of the FEAST program by OzHarvest, across primary schools in NSW, provides an invaluable opportunity to gain scholarly and translational research outcomes. As such, this paper has described the protocol for a pragmatic, non-randomized controlled trial involving a wait-list control group. The evaluation of FEAST will contribute to a growing body of work investigating the effectiveness of school-based interventions incorporating nutrition and sustainability education with experiential activities.</p>
              <p id="Par102">There are both strengths and limitations to the evaluation design. It has been acknowledged that using a non-randomized design has the potential to introduce selection bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. However, due to the pragmatic nature of this study, which will be conducted in the real world, where schools will self-select to participate in both the FEAST program and subsequently in the trial, randomization will not be possible. Despite this potential for bias, using a wait-list control with pre- and post-measures, should help mitigate some of the issues related to this type of bias. Other protections from potential bias when using a NRCT design include the provisions of a detailed protocol with pre-specified statistical analysis plan which, should include, predefined primary and secondary outcomes, their derivations from measured variables, methods for managing missing data, as well as planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], all of which, have been included in this protocol description.</p>
              <p id="Par103">Another limitation of this study is the reliance on self-reported measures from children aged 10–12 years. However, the majority of questions utilised to create the FEAST survey instrument, were taken from reliable and validated surveys that have been tested among this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been found that cognitive abilities required to self-report food intake increase among children aged 8 years and over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], and the FEAST program is designed for children over this age. Another concern with self-reported measures, is that there is the possibility that students may answer in a socially desirable manner and as a result they may be over- or underestimating their responses, depending on recall bias. Although this is a common challenge with this type of research, to limit the potential for social desirability bias, the students will be advised prior to survey completion that the survey is not a test, there are no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ answers, and that it is important for them to report as honestly as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par104">Strengths of the FEAST program include the incorporation of a number of components that have shown to contribute to effective school-based nutrition education programs for children, such as the implementation of: multi-component strategies (involving teachers, parents/caregivers and community) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]; age-appropriate, hands-on experiential activities (such as food preparation and cooking) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]; exposure to F&amp;V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]; strategies to enhance fidelity by training the implementers with standardized protocols (i.e. accredited teacher training) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]; integration of such programs within the curriculum (aligned with the Grades 5–6 key learning areas in the Australian Curriculum) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; as well as proper alignment between the objectives, intervention, and desired outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par105">The strengths of the evaluation design include the use of: the 33-item SPIRIT checklist to guide the design of the protocol; using a controlled design; questions for the primary outcomes derived from reliable and validated measures tested on this age group; many of the secondary outcomes, were also derived from reliable and validated measures. The trial is well powered to detect changes in outcomes and the trial statistician will be blinded to group allocation when conducting the statistical analyses. Also, this trial has included qualitative questions embedded within the quantitative surveys. The combination of qualitative and quantitative components within the surveys, will enable the trial’s conclusions to be expanded upon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. If triangulation of results is found between qualitative and quantitative components, then convergence of outcomes allows for stronger inferences about findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par106">Furthermore, non-randomized evaluation designs can contribute data on the effectiveness of interventions, and if conducted and reported systematically, have the capacity to contribute to building evidence-based public health practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Accordingly, the TREND (Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>] and the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement for pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] will be used to report outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par107">Given the challenges of promoting healthy diets, sustainable eating and reducing food waste at the population level, the FEAST program is well-positioned to play a key role in this school-based approach to engage students to eat healthily and sustainably. Initiatives undertaken within the school system have the added advantage of reaching large, diverse populations, placing them in a unique situation to deliver universal and equitable public health strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par108">If this program demonstrates effectiveness, FEAST will have the potential to benefit students by providing them with a set of tools to help them achieve healthy and sustainable eating practices. FEAST also has the potential to support the Australian Curriculum with health promoting and sustainability messages, which could contribute to: health promotion within schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]; sustainable schools initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]; government-supported public health initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]; prevention of chronic conditions, in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]; the national agenda to reduce food waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] as well as to the sustainable development goal targets for 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>].</p>

              <p>The research team would like to thank OzHarvest CEO Ronni Kahn (AO) for allowing the research team to evaluate the FEAST program. The FEAST pilot program was created, funded and implemented by OzHarvest. The ongoing rollout of the program is made possible, thanks to the support offered to OzHarvest from local government, corporate and philanthropic organizations. The FEAST program was designed by Amelia Berner (OzHarvest FEAST Education Manager), Angela Colliver (Angela Colliver Consultancy Services), Rachel Rothwell (OzHarvest NSW Education Coordinator), Graziela Machado (Graphic Designer and Illustrator), and Fiona Nearn (OzHarvest Media &amp; Communications Manager) was the copywriter. We would also like to thank Amelia Berner and Rachel Rothwell, for their input during survey development. OzHarvest employees and their sponsors and donors will not have a role in data collection, analysis, and interpretation, nor in the dissemination of findings. OzHarvest will however, be able to use the published data from peer-reviewed journals for reports to schools, stakeholders, governmental bodies and their sponsors/funders, as well as to the general public.</p>

              <p id="Par111">Ethical approval has been obtained through the Human Ethics Advisory Group, Faculty of Health at Deakin University (HEAG-H-31_2020). Any changes required for the study, will be applied for via the HEAG modification process. Permission has also been gained from the Department of Education, via the NSW State Education Research Application Process (SERAP 2019163), to conduct research within NSW schools. Prior to trial commencement, plain language statements will be issued to all participants explaining study protocol, potential benefits and risks, including options for withdrawal from the trial.
