                <p>In 2021, guidelines for early childhood education and care were released recommending children are provided access to outdoor areas during all free play sessions to reduce the risk of coronavirus disease of 2019 transmission, aligning with the existing recommendations to increase childrenâ€™s physical activity. There is a need to understand how to disseminate guidelines in this setting as dissemination is a prerequisite of adoption and implementation. This randomized controlled trial explored the impact of a video-based strategy to disseminate guidelines on family day care educatorsâ€™ intentions to adopt outdoor free play guidelines. Educators (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>â€‰=â€‰255) were randomized to receive a video (intervention) or text-based (usual care) resource via email describing recommendations. Educators were invited to participate in a post-intervention survey at 5-week follow-up assessing intentions to adopt guidelines. The secondary outcomes included knowledge, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, social/professional role and identity, goals, implementation of guidelines, acceptability of resource and intervention reach. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in intentions to adopt guidelines [ÃŸâ€‰=â€‰0.01 (95% confidence interval âˆ’0.50 to 0.52), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.97], nor for any secondary outcomes. Further investigation is needed to identify effective dissemination strategies in the family day care setting to increase the adoption of public health guidelines.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Adequate physical activity in young children is associated with reduced risk of overweight and obesity, as well as improved motor skills, fitness and skeletal health [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Global guidelines recommend that children &lt;5â€‰years accumulate 180â€‰minutes of physical activity every day [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], however systematic review evidence indicates that many children internationally do not meet this benchmark [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4â€“6</xref>]. Given early childhood education and care (ECEC) services have existing infrastructure to promote physical activity and reach up to 87% of children aged 3â€“5â€‰years for prolonged periods of the day [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the World Health Organization recommends ECEC as a key setting to improve childrenâ€™s physical activity [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>ECEC services include centre-based services, such as preschools and long day care, and home-based services, known as family child care homes, childminding or family day care (as referred to hereafter). In comparison to centre-based services which have multiple staff members employed in various roles (e.g. nominated supervisor, educator, director and service cook), family day care is a type of regulated ECEC service in which an individual educator provides care to small numbers of children in the educatorâ€™s own home [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Australia, family day care services are monitored and supported by an overarching organization (i.e.Â service provider/scheme); however, they are predominantly responsible for their servicesâ€™ operation [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Family day care is accessed by &gt;90â€‰000 children for an average of 25â€‰hours per week in Australia [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Systematic review evidence of observational studies indicates that outdoor play in ECEC services is associated with increased physical activity levels and reduced sedentary behaviour in children [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These findings are also supported by evidence from recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As such, many authorities internationally recommend ECEC services, including family day care, provide children with outdoor play every day [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite the potential benefits of offering outdoor play to children, a cross-sectional study published in 2022 suggests that just 24% of family day care services provide at least 60â€‰minutes of outdoor play time for children per day [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, government authorities released public health guidelines which recommend children spend more time outside to reduce the risk of transmission of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in ECEC [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], aligning with the best practice physical activity recommendations [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, this provides an opportunity to understand how to best support dissemination of these guidelines to family day care educators.</p>
              <p>Several implementation theories suggest that the dissemination of public health guidelines to end users is an important prerequisite to achieving adoption and implementation [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20â€“22</xref>]. Effective dissemination requires identifying an appropriate audience and delivering a tailored message and medium that best targets the barriers to adoption in this particular audience [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A RCT in centre-based ECEC services found evidence that targeted dissemination via enhanced resources improves ECEC service adoption of public health guidelines [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given the structural differences in centre-based and family day care services (e.g. educators are individually responsible for their servicesâ€™ daily programming), barriers to guideline adoption and implementation may differ. In particular, barriers pertinent to an individualâ€™s knowledge and beliefs (e.g. capability of implementing, consequences to implementing, alignment of professional role and goals) may need to be addressed specifically within dissemination strategies in this setting [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To date, no known trials have assessed the impact of different dissemination strategies on increasing intentions to adopt guidelines in the family day care setting.</p>

              <title>Aims</title>
              <p>The primary aim of this RCT was to explore the impact of guideline dissemination via a video resource (intervention) in comparison to a text-based resource (usual care control) sent by email on family day care educatorsâ€™ intentions to adopt outdoor free play guidelines. It was hypothesized that family day care educatorsâ€™ intentions to adopt guidelines would be higher in the intervention group, compared to control, as a result of viewing the video resource.</p>
              <p>The secondary outcomes included selected Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) constructs [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] of knowledge, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, social/professional role and identity and goals; implementation of guidelines and acceptability of resource format. It was hypothesized that TDF constructs [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], implementation of guidelines and acceptability of the resource format would be higher in the intervention group, compared to control.</p>
              <p>As dissemination via video resources has not been explored in the family day care literature, we also assessed the reach of the video (intervention) resource.</p>

              <title>Context</title>
              <p>In July 2021, guidelines from the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education were released to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in ECEC services [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These included the recommendation for ECEC services, including family day care services, to consider allowing children to access outdoor areas during all free play sessions, wherever possible [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="s5">
              <title>Design and participants</title>
              <p>A RCT design with post-intervention data collection only was employed. Registered family day care educators who care for children aged 0â€“12â€‰years and operated a service within the Hunter region of NSW were eligible to participate in this study. A previous study [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] indicates that there are &gt;500 family day care educators in the Hunter region, the majority of whom identify as women (100%) and work in low socioeconomic status (SES) (70%) and urban (53%) areas [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Non-English-speaking educators and those catering solely to children with additional needs were ineligible. Educatorsâ€™ contact details were obtained from service providers/schemes (overarching manager organization) collected for a previous study [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and from a professional development event held by â€˜Good for Kidsâ€™ in 2019. â€˜Good for Kidsâ€™ is an initiative in the jurisdiction which has supported ECEC services to promote healthy eating and physical activity in children since 2006 [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and is a known and trusted source of advice for family day care services.</p>

              <title>Randomization and blinding</title>
              <p>Randomization of family day care educators to intervention or control groups occurred at a 1:1 ratio using a random number generator in Microsoft Excel. This was an open trial, and educators were aware that they had received the intervention. Data collectors (those collecting survey data) could not be blinded to allocation due to the intervention group receiving additional questions regarding the video.</p>

              <title>Intervention</title>
              <p>Intervention development was informed by the Model for Dissemination of Research which describes four key components required for effective dissemination: source, audience, channel and message [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We predefined the source (i.e. â€˜Good for Kidsâ€™, a reputable organization trusted by the target audience) and audience (i.e.Â family day care educators, as delivery system actors in a key setting for implementation), which remained constant across both groups. Therefore, this trial sought to manipulate the dissemination channel and message. In regard to channel, qualitative research indicates that ECEC staff prefer to receive information through video messages (as they are engaging) delivered via electronic media [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, Brownson and colleagues note that dissemination â€˜is enhanced when messages are framed in ways that evoke emotion and interest and demonstrate usefulnessâ€™ and identify YouTube as a useful tool for non-research audiences [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As such, a video resource available on YouTube was selected as the intervention channel. To manipulate the message, we included content which addressed selected TDF constructs [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (i.e. knowledge, beliefs about capabilities and consequences, social/professional role and identity and goals) as these are identified barriers to guideline adoption and implementation and amenable to change via strategies embedded within a resource [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Examples of content included simple, achievable steps and examples of how to implement guidelines (targets knowledge, beliefs about capabilities and goals) and the multiple benefits of implementing guidelines as a family day care educator (targets beliefs about consequences, social/professional role and identity).</p>
              <p>The intervention group received an email from â€˜Good for Kidsâ€™ in March 2022 which included a web link to the video resource on YouTube (accessible by email invitees only to prevent contamination) and a web link to the guidelines on the NSW Department of Education website [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The video resource was designed by implementation researchers and health promotion staff and created using Powtoon software [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As per the best practice suggestions [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the video contained good audio and visual quality, was short (2â€‰minutes) and presented a clear message using simple language, with only essential information included. The video was tailored to the target audience by including first person narrative, spoken from the perspective of a family day care educator; dynamic, colourful imagery of children to represent the family day care setting and evoke emotion and practical, setting-specific tips for the target behaviour (i.e.Â providing more outdoor play) which were visually demonstrated. The 2-minute video has been made publicly available following all data collection and analysis for this study (<ext-link xlink:href="http://goodforkids.nsw.gov.au/early-childhood-services/resources/physical-activity" ext-link-type="uri">goodforkids.nsw.gov.au/early-childhood-services/resources/physical-activity</ext-link>).</p>

Intention-to-treat linear regression analyses were employed to assess the difference in outcomes between groups, controlling for SES and locality for all outcomes (as per trial protocol). As the study obtained follow-up data only (i.e.Â no baseline data were collected), if a responding participant did not complete all items relevant for an outcome (e.g. if they only answered three of the four items used to assess intentions to adopt), data were excluded in the analysis of that outcome only.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study aimed to assess the impact of a video resource, compared to a text-based resource, on family day care educatorsâ€™ intentions to adopt outdoor free play guidelines. Despite use of an engaging medium (as described by ECEC staff) [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], keeping video duration in line with recommendations for this format [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and efforts to tailor the video resource to the target audience and address barriers [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we found no statistically significant difference between the intervention group and control for any of the primary or secondary outcomes. We found that intentions to adopt were high among both groups, suggesting there may be ceiling effects on the measure used to assess the primary outcome. The smaller than intended sample size is also likely to make it challenging to describe differences between groups.</p>
              <p>Previous findings from RCTs which examine dissemination strategies on educatorsâ€™ intentions to adopt guidelines in the ECEC setting are mixed, with one study demonstrating significant improvements [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and another reporting no impact [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Evidence in centre-based ECEC has indicated that offering follow-up support, training, feedback and incentives in addition to providing video and text-based resources may improve service adoption of the best practice guidelines [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the current trial, control services received usual care, which involved receiving guidelines in generic text-based form. As the intervention only manipulated the channel and message of dissemination, it is possible that the strategies embedded within the video resource content did not sufficiently target the reported barriers to produce notable differences between groups in intentions to adopt guidelines. Furthermore, we were unable to recruit the desired sample of 72 educators which reduced our ability to detect a mean difference of 0.4 mean score. However, the magnitude of effect in the current study suggests that an increased number of participants are unlikely to change the direction of effect found in this study. The recruitment of family day care educators into trials has previously been noted as a challenge [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Future trials in this setting should aim to implement strategies to increase study consent rates. This may include engaging with service providers/schemes and having them introduce and endorse the study via newsletters or internal emails prior to recruitment or addressing educatorsâ€™ concerns about participation during recruitment [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>We found no statistically significant differences between groups on TDF constructs [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] nor implementation of guidelines (although this favoured the intervention arm), consistent with previous research undertaken in centre-based ECEC settings [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Across both groups and all TDF constructs [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], scores were skewed toward the high end of the scale (mean score: 6.0; median score: 6). As the guidelines were publicly accessible prior to the study being conducted, baseline knowledge and beliefs may have reached a peak prior to the dissemination of the video resource and a ceiling effect incurred. While the tool used to assess TDF constructs was validated [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], efforts to improve sensitivity may increase the toolsâ€™ ability to detect differences between groups. This may be achieved by removing unnecessary anchors such as â€˜slightly agreeâ€™, as these may create noise and reduce item comprehensibility, or removing items that are redundant or poorly functioning [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
              <p>Despite high intentions to adopt and awareness of the guidelines, few services reported implementing the guidelines fully, findings consistent with other services in ECEC [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our findings suggest that dissemination strategies may need to be coupled with additional strategies where feasible to increase impact of guidelines [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While non-significant, given acceptability of the resource favoured the control, future dissemination efforts may also consider embedding strategies within alternate text-based resources (e.g. interactive newsletters), which has previously been demonstrated to increase intentions to adopt guidelines in centre-based services [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There is also RCT and cross-sectional evidence which demonstrates a positive association between having a physical activity policy with outdoor play components and the provision of outdoor play in ECEC services [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Future research should consider including strategies to support the development of a service physical activity policy, which aligns with national recommendations to increase the provision of outdoor free play.</p>
              <p>This is the first known trial to examine the impact of dissemination of guidelines via a video resource in the family day care setting. While this trial did not produce the expected changes in intentions to adopt guidelines or TDF constructs, there may be benefits in including video as a channel to deliver health information to family day care educators. Our finding that 69% of participants viewed the video resource is comparable to findings reported in a RCT with family day care services in the United States [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This suggests that videos may have the capacity to reach the majority of family day care educators and be a useful way to communicate information, which is particularly important in this difficult-to-reach setting [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As such, the impact of video delivery of resources to improve child physical activity in the family day care setting should be further explored.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Strength of this study was the use of a RCT design and application of theory to develop the intervention resource. However, this study had several limitations. There was a significant difference in the number of intervention and control educators consenting to participate. As participants in the intervention group were asked whether they had viewed the video, this may have resulted in selective attrition from the study due to not viewing the video. The target sample size of 72 educators was not reached, likely given the high proportion (29%) of ineligible educators, primarily due to no longer working as a family day care educator. This is unsurprising given the context in which the study was undertaken and the decrease in number of operating family day care services during the pandemic as a result of multiple lockdowns [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, post-intervention data only were collected; therefore, potential differences in baseline outcomes were not able to be assessed. Finally, data were collected âˆ¼5â€‰months following the delivery of the intervention due to challenges with reaching family day care educators during this time. As the number of participants reporting viewing video was lower than the unique views obtained from analytics, there may have been some recall bias in response given the time lapsed following intervention delivery.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study found that a dissemination strategy (resource changing the message and channel components) did not produce differences in educatorsâ€™ intentions to adopt outdoor free play guidelines compared to control, nor any of the other secondary outcomes assessed (knowledge, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, social/professional role and identity and goals; implementation of guidelines and acceptability of resource format). Further research that is adequately powered, using rigorous study designs, is required to understand the impact of different disseminations approaches on increasing the adoption of public health guidelines in the family day care setting.</p>
