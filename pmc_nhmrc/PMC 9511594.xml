                <title>Introduction</title>
                <p>Multicomponent school-based physical activity (PA) interventions can improve studentsâ€™ cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and PA. Due to the complex nature of such interventions when delivered at scale their effect sizes markedly reduce. Modifying student school uniforms, so that they are more PA enabling, may be a simple intervention that could enhance student health. The primary aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of an activity enabling uniform intervention (shorts, polo shirt and sports shoes) in improving childrenâ€™s CRF.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 24 primary schools in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Schools will be randomly allocated to either intervention or usual practice following baseline data collection. Active WeAR Everyday intervention schools will allow students in grades 4â€“6 (aged approx. 9â€“12â€‰years) to wear their existing sports uniform (shorts, polo shirt and sports shoes) every day. To avoid any financial cost to students they will be provided with two additional sports shirts and one pair of shorts. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 9â€‰months postbaseline. The primary outcome is studentsâ€™ CRF measured using the 20â€‰m multistage fitness test. Secondary outcomes include studentsâ€™: mean daily steps and steps/minute measured via accelerometer, quality of life, mental well-being and perceived PA self-efficacy. The acceptability, feasibility and cost of the intervention will be assessed. Analyses will be performed using an intention-to-treat framework. Linear mixed effects regression models will be used to assess intervention effects on the primary outcome at follow-up. Planned exploratory analyses will examine effects by subgroups (eg, gender).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The World Heart Federation and the American Heart Association identify physical inactivity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These risks manifest in childhood and track over time.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Further, systematic reviews of longitudinal studies demonstrate that measures of physical activity and CRF in childhood are associated with CVD risks in adulthood.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4</xref> Moreover, both physical activity and CRF have been found to improve young peopleâ€™s mental health and well-being.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â€“8</xref> The WHO global action plans for the prevention of chronic disease,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> recommends the promotion of physical activity and enhanced fitness through school-based interventions for the prevention of CVD.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Meta-analyses of school-based interventions demonstrate their efficacy in improving physical activity and CRF.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, reviews of efforts to â€˜scale-upâ€™ evidence-based interventions in schools suggest they have little impact on such outcomes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A primary impediment to the successful implementation of school-based physical activity interventions at scale is the poor alignment between interventions that have been tested and local school contexts.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Specifically, most physical activity interventions are trialled under optimal research conditions, are complex, intensive, delivered by experts, and require knowledge, skills and resources that are not routinely available in schools.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Such intervention characteristics present considerable implementation challenges. Indeed, poor implementation has been responsible, in part, for the equivocal effects of government funded scale-up of physical activity interventions in education settings globally.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15â€“19</xref> In order to improve the cardiovascular health of the community, effective interventions that are easily implemented at scale with minimal ongoing cost are urgently needed.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 20 21</xref></p>
              <p>Internationally many countries, including Australia, UK, Japan as well as parts of Canada, New Zealand, North and South America and south-east Asia, require students in some or all schools to wear a uniform to school.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22â€“25</xref> While the formality of these uniforms may differ between countries they can often require girls to wear a dress or tunic, skirt and blouse (or in some countries trousers with blouse), with socks or stockings and black leather shoes; and boys to wear pants or shorts with button-up or polo shirts, sometimes a tie and black leather shoes. The impracticality of such uniforms is a well-documented impediment to physical activity, particularly for girls.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 26â€“29</xref> Qualitative research suggests that traditional school uniforms restrict movement, hold students back from playing sport and raise concerns regarding body image.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> Quantitative studies have reported positive associations between objective measures of physical activity and activity-supporting uniforms.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p>While this research suggests that changing to activity-supporting school uniforms (ie, attire conducive to physical activity) may be effective in improving student fitness and physical activity,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> there has only been one randomised trial internationally that has tested the effects of this scalable intervention.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This study, conducted by the author team, undertook an initial randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared accelerometer-assessed physical activity of students from schools randomised to wear their sports uniform (ie, polo shirt, shorts and sports shoes) in place of their traditional uniform on a randomly selected day; to studentâ€™s from schools randomised to wear their traditional uniform on a randomly selected day. While non-significant, the results were promising, with improvements in studentsâ€™ accelerometer counts per minute (36.54; 95%â€‰CI âˆ’0.28 to 73.37: p=0.12) which were slightly higher for girls (36.97; 95%â€‰CI âˆ’13.90 to 87.85) than boys (35.33; 95%â€‰CI âˆ’18.04 to 88.71. There were also improvements in girlsâ€™ light intensity physical activity (1.47â€‰min, 95%â€‰CI âˆ’ 0.06 to 3.00, pâ€‰=â€‰0.059) and sedentary activity (âˆ’ 2.23â€‰min; 95%â€‰CI âˆ’ 4.49 to 0.02, pâ€‰=â€‰0.052).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> As the intervention occurred over a single school week, the impact of the intervention on measures of CRF outcomes, which would take longer to accrue, were not assessed in the pilot. Furthermore, the study was not able to investigate the impact that such an intervention may have on children beyond their physical health such as mental health and well-being. While findings from the pilot study are promising, an adequately powered randomised trial undertaken in more naturalistic contexts and with longer-term follow-up and a broader range of outcomes is required.</p>
              <p>This study aims to assess the effectiveness of an activity enabling uniform intervention in improving the CRF of children aged 9â€“12 years. The secondary aims are to assess the impact on studentsâ€™ mean daily step count, steps/minute, well-being, quality of life scores and self-efficacy for physical activity. The acceptability, feasibility and cost of the intervention will also be assessed.</p>

Students at intervention schools will then wear their sport uniform each school day (ie, 5â€‰days) for approximately a 9-month period for all schools (up to 18 months for a sub group of schools recruited in 2021). The provision of extra uniforms, in addition to their own existing sports uniforms (which they already wear 1â€‰day per week), will supply children with sufficient sports uniforms to last the school week. This was important to avoid parents/carers having to regularly wash their childâ€™s uniforms to wear each day and to ensure that there was no economic repercussions on families as a result of this intervention. There is currently department of education support for such a policy in NSW government schools.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Research staff will work with schools to support the transition to the activity-enabling uniform.</p>

                <p>Between-group differences in trial outcomes at follow-up will be assessed using linear mixed models for continuous outcomes and generalised linear mixed models for dichotomous or categorical outcomes using appropriate distribution and link functions. All models will include a random intercept for school and class nested within school to account for the clustered design of the trial, and fixed effects for group and the baseline value of the outcome and variables prognostic of the outcome (eg, school sector) and the socioeconomic (higher socioeconomic or lower socioeconomic) or geographic (rural or urban) location of the childâ€™s primary home address based on their postcode. The primary analyses will be conducted under an intention-to-treat framework, with all available valid data analysed in the group originally allocated. Multiple imputation will be used to address missing data at follow-up using the fully conditional method and estimates combined using Rubinâ€™s rule. Per-protocol analyses will also be conducted to explore differences between students who reported that they wore an active uniform everyday in the week before to those who did not. An alpha level of 5% will be used to determine statistically significant differences. Planned exploratory analyses will examine effects by subgroups (eg, student sex, school sector, existing uniform policy), which will be assessed by including the variable for the relevant sub-group along with a relevant subgroup by group interaction term in the models. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample and process data. To avoid biased interpretation of any research findings where possible process data will be analysed before trial outcomes are known.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To support children and adolescents to improve their physical activity, fitness and overall well-being, the WHO recommends the implementation of school-based physical activity programmes. However, findings of systematic reviews have found that, when implemented at scale, these programmes have minimal impact on students, and in particular on girls. Unless effective physical activity and fitness interventions can be delivered at scale, they cannot reduce CVD risks at a population level. This research tests an intervention that has been purposefully selected on the basis that it is amenable to rapid spread (highly scalable). If found to be effective, the intervention is simple and scalable thus it will have the potential to be implemented across any jurisdiction internationally which requires studentsâ€™ wearing of school uniforms.</p>

                  <p>Given students will be wearing their usual sports uniform it is not expected that participants will be at any greater risk of adverse events than they would be when participating in normal school activities that would warrant discontinuation of the trial. However, any adverse events or unintended effects will be recorded and reported to the Chair of the ethics committee and advice sought regarding required action. The trial registration record will be updated with any protocol modifications and any deviations from original protocol will be reported in study outcome papers. At the time of submitting this manuscript for publication an amendment was made to a secondary outcome (with trial registration updated accordingly). We originally intended to report student Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) as a secondary outcome, however, given the potential for erroneous estimates of activity using cut points for wrist worn accelerometers it was decided to use an absolute measure of physical activity that is, mean daily steps.</p>
