                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>WHO recommends the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) as a priority. However, there are many countries yet to introduce PCV, especially in Asia. This trial aims to evaluate different PCV schedules and to provide a head-to-head comparison of PCV10 and PCV13 in order to generate evidence to assist with decisions regarding PCV introduction. Schedules will be compared in relation to their immunogenicity and impact on nasopharyngeal carriage of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This randomised, single-blind controlled trial involves 1200 infants recruited at 2 months of age to one of six infant PCV schedules: PCV10 in a 3+1, 3+0, 2+1â€‰or two-dose schedule; PCV13 in a 2+1â€‰schedule; and controls that receive two doses of PCV10 and 18 and 24 months. An additional control group of 200 children is recruited at 18 months that receive one dose of PCV10 at 24 months. All participants are followed up until 24 months of age. The primary outcome is the post-primary series immunogenicity, expressed as the proportions of participants with serotype-specific antibody levelsâ€‰â‰¥0.35â€‰Âµg/mL for each serotype in PCV10.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval has been obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Health Research (EC00153) and the Vietnam Ministry of Health Ethics Committee. The results, interpretation and conclusions will be presented to parents and guardians, at national and international conferences, and published in peer-reviewed open access journals.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) remains a leading vaccine preventable cause of serious infection in young children, despite the availability of effective vaccines. The first infant pneumococcal vaccine, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), was licensed in the USA in the year 2000. Introduction of PCV7 has been associated with dramatic reductions in pneumococcal disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â€“3</xref> However, geographical variation in serotype distribution<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4â€“7</xref> and an increase in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by non-PCV7 serotypes following vaccine introduction<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> necessitated the development of higher valency PCVs.</p>
                <p>There are currently two licensed PCVs: PCV10, a 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine that uses non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (NTHi) protein D as a carrier protein for 8Â of the 10 serotypes (<italic>Synflorix</italic>, PHiD-CV; GSK); and PCV13, a 13-valent pneumococcal CRM<sub>197</sub> conjugate vaccine (<italic>Prevnar-13/Prevenar-13</italic>; Pfizer). Both have been shown to be non-inferior to PCV7 in terms of post-primary series immunogenicity for the shared serotypes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9â€“11</xref> Despite the availability of both PCV10 and PCV13 for several years, there have been no published studies to date directly comparing their post-primary series immunogenicity or impact on nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage.</p>
                <p>The cost of PCVs is a major barrier to vaccine introduction in low-income to middle-income countries; therefore, investigation of alternative schedules with a reduced number of doses is of great importance. The uptake of PCV introduction in Asia has been particularly slow. Three schedules are currently in routine use around the world for PCV introduction: a 3+1â€‰schedule (a three-dose primary series followed by a booster dose in the second year of life), a 3+0â€‰schedule (a three-dose primary series without a booster dose) and a 2+1â€‰schedule (a two-dose primary series followed by a booster dose in the second year of life). Data from periods of PCV7 shortage in the USA show high vaccine effectiveness of a two-dose primary series against IPD,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> and trial data of CRM<sub>197</sub>-conjugated PCVs show comparable immunogenicity following a two-dose or three-dose primary series, although antibody levels to serotypes 6B and 23F tend to be lower after two doses.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Trials of PCV10 and PCV13 also support the use of a two-dose primary series. A trial of PCV10 in Europe directly comparing the immunogenicity of a two-dose and three-dose primary series showed a similar proportion of participants achieving protective antibody levels (â‰¥0.2â€‰Âµg/mL) for all 10 serotypes.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In a trial of PCV13 in Mexico, over 93% of participants achieved protective antibody levels (â‰¥0.35â€‰Âµg/mL) for most of the 13 serotypes following two doses, with the exception of serotypes 6B and 23F.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Four trials in Europe directly comparing PCV13 and PCV7 responses showed comparable immune responses between the vaccines following two doses.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
                <p>In developing countries, a 2+1â€‰schedule with a booster dose in the first year of life may be advantageous. This modified schedule would likely increase compliance, would provide full immunisation closer to the peak incidence of pneumococcal disease and could enable the booster dose to coincide with measles vaccination. Alternatively, a further reduced PCV schedule with only two doses may be optimal for pneumococcal vaccination. Our previous trial in Fiji showed that protective antibody levels were reached for five of the seven serotypes following a single dose of PCV7 at 14 weeks of age.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Furthermore, a booster dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at 12 months of age was more immunogenic following a single dose primary series of PCV7 compared with a two-dose or three-dose primary series for four serotypes, and comparable for the other three serotypes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A trial of PCV9 from South Africa also showed that one dose at 6â€‰weeks of age elicited a significant response for seven serotypes,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and modelling data from the USA suggest that a single dose of PCV could prevent up to 62% of IPD.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> More recently, in the UK, where routine infant PCV vaccination has been in place for over 10 years, a 1+1â€‰schedule of PCV13 was shown to elicit equivalent or superior post-booster responses compared with a 2+1â€‰schedule for nine serotypes.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
                <p>Carriage of pneumococci in the nasopharynx is commonly a prerequisite for IPD and is the usual means of transmission of the bacteria. The herd effect of pneumococcal vaccination is mediated by the impact on NP carriage.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Vaccination with PCVs generally results in a decrease in vaccine type (VT) pneumococcal carriage, which is most commonly observed after a booster dose and often accompanied by a compensatory increase in non-VT carriage.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23â€“27</xref> There have been few trials that evaluate the effect of different PCV schedules on carriage. A trial from the Netherlands showed that a two-dose primary series with or without a booster reduced VT carriage at 12 months of age compared with controls.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> VT carriage was further reduced at 18 months in the group that received the booster dose, compared with the group that did not receive the booster, although this difference did not persist at 24 months of age. Similarly, our trial in Fiji showed that a two-dose or three-dose primary series with or without a booster reduced VT carriage at 12 months of age compared with controls, but no difference was seen at 17 months of age (F Russell, personal communication).</p>
                <p>It has been hypothesised that the protein D carrier in PCV10 may result in an impact on <italic>H. influenzae</italic> carriage. A recent review of the impact of protein D-containing PCVs on NTHi carriage concludes that any such impact is likely to be small and transient, although changes in the density of carriage are yet to be evaluated. Two large phase III trials (POET trial of an 11-valent PCV and COMPAS trial of PCV10) showed trends towards a reduction in NTHi carriage following a booster dose of PCV, along with a trial of PCV10 in toddlers in Kenya, but other trials conducted in Finland, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic showed no impact of PCV10 on NTHi carriage.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
                <p>This trial includes six infant vaccination schedules: four different PCV10 schedules (arm A, a 3+1â€‰schedule at 2, 3, 4 and 9 months of age; arm B, a 3+0â€‰schedule at 2, 3 and 4 months; arm C, a 2+1â€‰schedule at 2, 4 and 9.5 months; and arm D, a two-dose schedule at 2 and 6 months); a 2+1 PCV13 schedule at 2, 4 and 9.5 months (arm E); and a control group that receives two doses of PCV10 at 18 and 24 months (arm F). In response to more recent interest in schedules with only one or two doses of PCV, which may be sufficient to maintain herd immunity at the population level, an additional control group is recruited at 18 months of age for comparison with the initial control group (arm G).</p>

                <title>Explanation for choice of comparators</title>
                <p>There was no PCV licensed in Vietnam at the time the protocol was finalised in 2013. The inclusion of control groups that receive no infant doses of PCV is therefore justified. Control group participants recruited in infancy receive two doses of PCV10, at 18 and 24 months of age. Control group participants recruited at 18 months of age receive a single dose of PCV10 at 24 months of age. Intervention group participants receive at least two doses of PCV in the first year of life. All participants receive pneumococcal immunisation that is likely to be effective and is not otherwise available in Vietnam. The specific regimens to be evaluated are based on likely future global recommendations and to directly compare the two licensed PCVs.</p>
                <p>Both PCV10 and PCV13 have been shown to be non-inferior to PCV7 for the serotypes common to both vaccines, and to have the potential to provide protection against the additional serotypes included.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9â€“11</xref> For both vaccines, the most common adverse reactions are redness at the injection site and irritability, which are common following administration of other vaccines. Other adverse reactions may include drowsiness; temporary loss of appetite; pain, redness or swelling at the injection site; and fever. Such reactions are usually temporary.</p>

              <title>Objectives</title>
              <p>This trial has been designed to answer two independent questions concurrently, relating to the evaluation of different schedules incorporating PCV10 and the comparison of PCV10 and PCV13:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What is the optimal schedule for provision of EPI vaccines with the incorporation of PCV10; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>How do the responses to vaccination with PCV10 or PCV13 compare?</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>The primary endpoint for both study questions is the post-primary series immunogenicity. For this endpoint, data from arms A and B are combined, as they receive an identical three-dose primary series (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for a detailed description of the trial arms). The primary analysis for each study question is to assess non-inferiority of the post-primary series immunogenicity (in terms of the proportion of participants achieving protective levels of serotype-specific IgG ofÂ â‰¥0.35â€‰Âµg/mL), using arms A+B as the comparator (see below for details). Non-inferiority is assessed for each of the 10Â serotypes in PCV10, and an overall conclusion of non-inferiority drawn if found for at least 7 of the 10Â serotypes.</p>

                <p>The Vietnam Pneumococcal Project is a single-blind, open-label, randomised controlled phase II/III non-inferiority trial to investigate simplified childhood vaccination schedules that are more appropriate for developing country use. This is a seven-arm trial that includes six different infant vaccination schedules (arms Aâ€“F) and an additional control group (arm G) recruited at 18 months of age (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Arm A receives PCV10 at 2, 3, 4 and 9 months of age (3+1); arm B receives PCV10 at 2, 3 and 4 months (3+0); arm C receives PCV10 at 2, 4 and 9.5 months (2+1); arm D receives PCV10 at 2 and 6 months (two-dose); arm E receives PCV13 at 2, 4 and 9.5 months (2+1); arm F receives two doses of PCV10 at 18 and 24 months; and arm G receives one dose of PCV10 at 24 months.

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p>PCV introduction in Asia has been slow, in part due to a lack of local or regional data on the effect of PCV. We selected the Southeast Asian country of Vietnam as the location for the trial as a country with a strong health system, a track record of conducting relevant clinical trials, and a Government with strong interest both in the trial and in introducing PCV in the near future. Furthermore, trial results from Vietnam are likely to be considered as applicable to other countries in the region. This is the first trial involving infants to take place within Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city in Vietnam. The trial is conducted in two districts, District 4 and District 7. Districts are divided into communes, each of which has a health centre that provides preventive health services including EPI immunisations, along with some primary healthcare services. The study is conducted in one commune health centre in each district, with participants drawn from the surrounding communes within that district.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The target sample size for infant recruitment (groups Aâ€“F) is 1200 with an allocation ratio of 3:3:5:4:5:4, resulting in target group sizes of A=150, B=150, C=250, D=200, E=250â€‰and F=200. An additional target of 200 children aged 18 months are recruited into group G. Sample size calculations are based on the primary outcome of post-primary series immunogenicity (proportion of participants with serotype-specific antibody concentrationsâ€‰â‰¥0.35â€‰Âµg/mL) for each of the two study questions. A non-inferiority margin of aÂ 10% difference in absolute risk is deemed clinically significant, as used by regulatory authorities. Non-inferiority is assessed for each of the 10 serotypes in PCV10 (comparing groups A+B with group C or group E), and an overall conclusion of non-inferiority is drawn if the alternative hypotheses are accepted for at least 7Â of the 10 serotypes. This sample size providesÂ &gt;99%â€‰power for the overall conclusion of non-inferiority with a 5% one-sided type I error rate, estimated by simulation using a tailor-made program written for implementation in Stata with 10â€‰000 replications.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Powers for serotype-specific hypotheses range from 83% toÂ &gt;99%, calculated in PASS Software 2002 using the Farrington-Manning (1990) method.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Based on findings from our earlier work in Fiji and from data available in the literature,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43â€“45</xref> the assumed probabilities of antibody concentrationÂ â‰¥0.35â€‰Âµg/mL are 95% for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 7F, 9V, 14 and 19F; 90% for serotype 18C; 80% for serotype 23F; and 75% for serotype 6B. The within-subject correlation between the multiple binary endpoints is captured by a subject-level variation term with SD 1.7 in a random-effect logistic regression model, and the loss to follow-up rate is assumed to be 5% post-primary series and 10% at 12 months of age. The sample size also provides 98% power to detect a difference in post-primary series immunogenicity following two doses of PCV10 or PCV13, defined by a 10% difference in absolute risk based on Fisherâ€™s exact test (5% two-sided).</p>

Difference in carriage is defined by a relative risk of 0.6. The calculations were based on Fisherâ€™s exact tests (5% one-sided), assuming carriage rates in group F (controls) of 30% for NTHi and 24% for vaccine-type pneumococci, based on data from Vietnam (L Yoshida, personal communication).</p>

                <p>Participants in groups Aâ€“F are recruited from infants born in the study communes during the enrolment period. Commune health centre staff identify potential participants from the commune health centre birth records. Based on the expected number of births, around a quarter of infants born in the study communes need to be enrolled to complete recruitment within the target enrolment period of 12 months. Recruitment rates will be monitored on a monthly basis and meetings held with study staff and commune health centre staff to discuss any significant declines in recruitment rates. Commune health centre staff visit the home of potential participants when the infant is approximately 6â€‰weeks old and provide verbal and written information about the trial, in Vietnamese. Those interested in participating are referred to the study clinic when the infant is approximately 2â€‰months old. At this time, written informed consent is obtained (onlineÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">supplementary appendix 2</xref>), after which a study nurse/doctor examines the infant to ensure that all the eligibility criteria are met. Participants in group G are recruited from children turning 18 months old in the study communes in parallel to the children in groups Aâ€“F turning 18 months.</p>

                  <p>For each of the two study questions, the primary objective is to compare a 2+1â€‰schedule of (1) PCV10 and (2) PCV13, with a 3+1â€‰schedule of PCV10. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with serotype-specific antibody concentrationsâ€‰â‰¥0.35â€‰Âµg/mL, 4â€‰weeks post-primary series (at 5 months of age). Data from arms A and B are combined to form the three-dose post-primary series group. The primary analyses assess the non-inferiority of (1) two doses of PCV10 at 2 and 4 months of age (arm C) compared with three doses at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (arms A+B); and (2) two doses of PCV13 at 2 and 4 months of age (arm E) compared with three doses of PCV10 at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (arms A+B). The proportion of children achieving protective levels of serotype-specific IgG (â‰¥0.35â€‰Âµg/mL) 4â€‰weeks post-primary series is determined for each of the 10 PCV10 serotypes. The non-inferiority margin is defined by a 10% difference in absolute risk. The serotype-specific risk differences (arms A+B/arm C) with 90% CIs are calculated using the Newcombe Score method and the null hypothesis rejected if the upper bound of the CI isÂ &lt;10%. Overall non-inferiority is declared if at least 7 of the 10 individual null hypotheses are rejected at aÂ one-sided 5% level of significance. Secondary data analyses to address the primary objective include the ratio of GMCs post-primary series (arm C/arms A+Bâ€‰andÂ arm E/arms A+B) with 95% CIs, and the booster response analysed by analysis of covariance, adjusting for pre-booster levels.</p>

                  <p>The consent process is undertaken by specifically trained study staff. The study staff will go through the PLS and ICF, translated into Vietnamese, in detail with the potential participantâ€™s parent/legal guardian. The study staff will then discuss the trial further and answer any questions that may arise. Written informed consent is required prior to enrolment of the infant into the study. Consent is obtained from the parent/legal guardian as the participants are too young to provide consent themselves. A copy of the PLS and ICF will be given to the parent/legal guardian for their records.</p>
