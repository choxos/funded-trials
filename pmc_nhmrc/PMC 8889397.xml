                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Suicide is the leading cause of death among young Australians, accounting for one-third of all deaths in those under 25. Schools are a logical setting for youth suicide prevention activities, with universal, selective and indicated approaches all demonstrating efficacy. Given that international best practice recommends suicide prevention programmes combine these approaches, and that to date this has not been done in school settings, this study aims to evaluate a suicide prevention programme incorporating universal, selective and indicated components in schools.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study is a trial of a multimodal suicide prevention programme for young people. The programme involves delivering universal psychoeducation (safeTALK) to all students, screening them for suicide risk, and delivering internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (Reframe IT) to those students identified as being at high risk for suicide. The programme will be trialled in secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia, and target year 10 students (15 and 16 year-olds). safeTALK and screening will be evaluated using a single group pre-test/post-test case series, and Reframe IT will be evaluated in a Randomised Controlled Trial. The primary outcome is change in suicidal ideation; other outcomes include help-seeking behaviour and intentions, and suicide knowledge and stigma. The programme’s cost-effectiveness will also be evaluated.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study is the first to evaluate a suicide prevention programme comprising universal, selective and indicated components in Australian schools. If the programme is found to be efficacious and cost-effective, it could be more widely disseminated in schools and may ultimately lead to reduced rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour in school students across the region.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par32">Suicide is the leading cause of death in young Australians, accounting for more than one-third of all deaths in those under 25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Suicidal ideation and behaviour, including non-fatal suicide attempts and self-harm, are more common and are associated with a host of negative outcomes including risk of future suicidal behaviour and suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The impact of suicide on a young person’s family, friends, and wider community can be devastating and may include increased risk of suicidal behaviour and suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is therefore an urgent need to develop and test acceptable and accessible approaches to preventing suicide and suicidal behaviours in this population.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Schools are an appropriate and convenient setting for the delivery of youth suicide prevention programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and have been identified as important locations for suicide prevention activities by national and international suicide prevention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although school wellbeing staff may be well-placed to provide support to students at risk of suicide, young people are often reluctant to seek help from professionals and instead turn to their friends for support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. School-based prevention efforts must therefore not only target school staff, but also fellow students. Historically, there has been a reluctance to deliver suicide prevention efforts to students, due to concerns about the potentially iatrogenic impact of asking or talking about suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, increasing evidence suggests that it is safe to do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] revealed that school-based suicide prevention programmes should combine universal, selective, and indicated approaches in order to be most effective. Each approach as it relates to school settings is reviewed briefly below.</p>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Universal approaches</title>
                <p id="Par34">Universal approaches target whole populations, regardless of risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In school settings, these typically involve psychoeducation programmes, which aim to increase suicide literacy and reduce stigma, encourage help-seeking, and equip participants with skills to support peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A number of psychoeducation suicide prevention programmes have been tested internationally and appear to increase knowledge, attitudes, and help-seeking intentions; some have also been associated with reductions in suicidal ideation and behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One example is LivingWorks safeTALK, a 3.5-h workshop suitable for delivery to anyone over the age of 15. The programme has been positively evaluated in adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In 2015, our team conducted a pilot evaluation of safeTALK in secondary schools in Alice Springs, Australia, with 129 students (mean age = 16.7 years). The intervention was associated with increased knowledge about suicide, confidence to intervene with a suicidal person, and willingness to seek help and help others. No iatrogenic effects were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Selective approaches</title>
                <p id="Par35">Selective approaches aim to prevent the onset of suicidal thoughts or behaviour in populations at elevated risk of suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In school settings, these include training gatekeepers, such as teachers, to recognise and intervene with students at risk, and screening students for suicide risk followed by referral to relevant support. Screening can facilitate the identification of at-risk students, including those who have not previously sought help, and has not been associated with iatrogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As part of the evaluation of safeTALK described above, screening questions were embedded into the questionnaires to identify students potentially at risk of suicide. Almost half of the participants screened positive, many of whom had not previously sought help, and were referred for further support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Indicated approaches</title>
                <p id="Par36">Indicated approaches target those individuals already displaying suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours and include face-to-face psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and more recently, online programmes. A range of online programmes targeting suicidal thoughts have been developed and evaluated, with promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The “Reframe IT” programme was developed by our team in 2011. Reframe IT is an online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme specifically designed for young people presenting to the school counsellor with suicide risk. Reframe IT was piloted in two phases. First, a pre-test post-test case series study found it to be associated with reduced suicidal ideation, depression, and hopelessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Second, in a pilot randomised controlled trial, the intervention group showed larger (non-significant) mean improvements in suicidal ideation, depression, and hopelessness, when compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Participants in both studies provided positive feedback about Reframe IT, and it was not associated with any iatrogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>

              <sec id="Sec6">
                <title>Integrated approaches to suicide prevention</title>
                <p id="Par37">According to international best practice, suicide prevention programmes should incorporate universal, selective, and indicated approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such approaches have shown promise in both community and school settings, although the majority of those in school settings combine only two levels of prevention, such as universal (e.g. psychoeducation) and selective (e.g. screening) components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is therefore a need to develop, implement, and evaluate an approach combining universal, selective, and indicated approaches in school settings. To enable ongoing implementation and dissemination of such a programme, evidence must support not only its efficacy but also its cost-effectiveness. To date, no studies (Australian or otherwise) have applied rigorous economic methodology to evaluate short- and longer-term comparative cost-effectiveness of an intervention comprising universal, selective, and indicated elements.</p>

                <title>Aims and hypotheses</title>
                <p id="Par38">This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated programme comprising universal, selective, and indicated components in reducing suicide risk, improving risk recognition, and increasing health service use among young people across North West Melbourne. Secondary aims are to evaluate the programme’s safety and cost-effectiveness. The programme involves the delivery and evaluation of universal educational workshops (safeTALK) to school students plus screening students for suicide risk (universal and selective approaches; Component 1), and the evaluation of online CBT (Reframe IT) delivered to students identified as being at risk (indicated approach; Component 2). Several hypotheses have been generated relating to each of the project components as well as the project as a whole.</p>
                <p id="Par39">It is hypothesised that completion of the safeTALK workshop will be associated with increased intentions to intervene with a suicidal person, higher levels of suicide literacy, higher levels of perceived behavioural control regarding intervening with a suicidal person, and reduced stigma towards suicide and suicidal behaviour.</p>
                <p id="Par40">It is hypothesised that the screening will lead to the identification of students at risk of suicide-related behaviour who had not previously sought help.</p>
                <p id="Par41">It is hypothesised that, compared to the control group, students in the Reframe IT intervention group will demonstrate reduced suicidal ideation, reduced symptoms of depression, reduced hopelessness, and improved problem-solving.</p>
                <p id="Par42">It is hypothesised that the project as a whole will lead to increased health-service use; increased help-seeking from informal sources; and improved attitudes towards help-seeking.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Finally, it is hypothesised that the programme will be cost-effective and have no iatrogenic effects.</p>

                <p id="Par44">The present study will adopt two methodological approaches: Component 1 will employ a single-group, pre-test/post-test case series; Component 2 is a parallel superiority randomised controlled design, where the intervention condition (Reframe IT plus treatment as usual; TAU) is compared to TAU. Component 2 will be conducted and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par45">The study was designed to be conducted over a 5-year period (2019–2023), with a 3-year intervention phase. There has, however, been a 1-year suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, meaning that the study will continue into 2024.</p>

                <p id="Par48">This study is led by researchers at Orygen in Melbourne, Australia. Orygen is a youth mental health organisation with expertise in research, policy, education, and innovations in care. Since 1984, Orygen has been working side-by-side with young people to reduce the impact that mental ill-health has on young people, their families and society. Orygen services the north and west metropolitan areas of Melbourne, which, with a population of approximately 1.67 million, is one of the fastest growth corridors in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It includes 31% of the state’s total population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and 11 of Melbourne’s 14 most disadvantaged municipalities, and reports high levels of mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">Orygen research staff are part of the Centre for Youth Mental Health, University of Melbourne. This project is a partnership with Lifeline Australia and the Department of Education and Training Victoria. Other collaborators are the University of Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, Deakin University, and the University of Auckland.</p>
                <p id="Par50">The catchment area for the current study aligns with the four geographical areas that comprise north and west metropolitan Melbourne, according to the regional model operated by the Department of Education and Training Victoria and the Department of Health and Human Services Victoria as well as Orygen’s clinical catchment area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Mainstream secondary schools that are located in the study catchment area and have year 10 students enrolled will be eligible as study sites; at the time of publication, 141 schools meet these criteria.

Year 11 students will also be included if the school perceives a strong need for delivery of the programme to this year level, or if we struggle to meet the required sample size (see section “<xref rid="Sec34" ref-type="sec">Sample size and power calculation</xref>” of this paper). Exclusion criteria are intellectual disability and inability to converse in or read English. The additional inclusion criterion for participation in Component 2 (Reframe IT randomised controlled trial) is past 4-week suicidal ideation, as indicated by either a score of 21 or higher on the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS), or a score of 1–20 confirmed by a screening interview with a researcher.</p>

We hope this will also act as an incentive for schools to participate. The study team will take all reasonable steps to minimise any potential burden on school staff. Periodic communications will be provided to school leadership via newsletters and presentations to update on the progress of the study, and to acknowledge their support.

                <p id="Par74">Assessments will take the form of self-report questionnaires, and where possible will be collected using a computer or tablet employing REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure, web-based data capture application hosted at The University of Melbourne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Where questionnaires are completed on paper, these will be later entered into REDCap by a member of the research team. Assessments will be completed at school in class groups, facilitated by a researcher, and supervised by a school staff member.</p>
                <p id="Par75">The REDCap system will automatically flag any participants who score between 1 and 20 on the SIDAS, as 1 is the established cut-off score indicating any level of suicidal ideation in the past month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In the case that participants are required to complete paper versions of the questionnaire, they will be asked to include their full name on a separate detachable cover sheet. After the survey is completed, research staff will manually check their scores on the SIDAS instrument.</p>
                <p id="Par76">Within five school days of the baseline assessment, the research team will contact students who score between 1 and 20 on the SIDAS and conduct a brief semi-structured interview to determine eligibility for Component 2. Eligible students will be invited to participate and those who are interested will be given a consent form to be signed. They will then be randomised to either the intervention (Reframe IT) or control group (see below). A member of the research team will inform the relevant school staff member of the outcome of the randomisation.</p>
                <p id="Par77">Two weeks after the baseline assessment, safeTALK workshops will be delivered to all participating students. Immediately following the workshop, students will complete the T2 questionnaire. Students randomised to receive the Reframe IT intervention will complete the eight modules in the 10 weeks between T2 and T3 (i.e. approximately one module per week plus two additional weeks to allow for disruptions such as school holidays). Both T3 and T4 assessments will occur during class time; T4 will occur 12 weeks after T3. Researchers will be present at T3 and T4 assessment points if deemed appropriate by the research team and/or if requested by the school (e.g. they perceive a need for additional administrative support). No biological samples will be collected.</p>

An adult “host” character guides the user through the module and activities. Each module contains two “activities” based on standard CBT exercises. Users progress sequentially through the content, with modules automatically unlocked when the preceding module is complete. There is also a message board through which the participant can communicate with a moderator, a mood diary function, and a series of factsheets and information on local and national helplines and services.</p>

                  <p id="Par87">The primary outcome for this study is change in past 4-week suicidal ideation at T3 and T4 when compared to T2, assessed via the SIDAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The SIDAS is designed to screen individuals in the community for presence of suicidal thoughts and assess the severity of these thoughts. It comprises five items, each targeting an attribute of suicidal thoughts: frequency, controllability, closeness to attempt, level of distress associated with the thoughts and impact on daily functioning. Responses are measured on a 10-point scale. Total SIDAS scores are calculated as the sum of the five items, with controllability reverse scored (10 = 0, 9 = 1,…, 0 = 10), with total scale scores ranging from 0 to 50. Items are coded so that a higher total score reflects more severe suicidal thoughts.</p>

                  <p id="Par88">Change in symptoms of depression at T3 and T4 when compared to T2 will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire—9 item version (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Participants will be asked to indicate how often they have been bothered by nine problems over the past 2 weeks. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). Scores are summed such that the potential range is 0–27, with higher scores indicative of greater distress.</p>
                  <p id="Par89">Changes in hopelessness at T3 and T4 when compared to T2 will be assessed using the Hopelessness Scale for Children (HSC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], a 17-item measure of the occurrence of cognitions related to hopelessness within the past week. Participants rate each item as true or untrue of them; items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 16 are scored as reflecting hopelessness if rated “false” and items 2, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17 if rated “true”. Higher scores (maximum = 17) reflect greater hopelessness or negative expectations towards the future.</p>
                  <p id="Par90">Change in problem-solving ability at T3 and T4 when compared to T2 will be assessed using the Negative Problem Orientation Questionnaire (NPOQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], which contains 12 items assessing dysfunctional attitudes related to problem-solving ability. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (“not at all true of me”) to 5 (“extremely true of me”). Responses to each item are summed to calculate a total score, with a potential range of 12–60; higher scores indicate poorer problem-solving ability.</p>
                  <p id="Par91">Change in current suicidal ideation at T2 when compared to T1 will be measured using a single purpose-designed item, “Are you thinking about killing yourself right now?”. If yes, participants will be asked to indicate which of the following describes the level of suicidal ideation they are experiencing: “Mild suicidal thoughts with no plan or intent to act”; “Moderate suicidal thoughts with a rough plan and some intent”; “Severe suicidal thoughts with a specific plan and intent to act”. The counts falling into the different levels will be used for analysis.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">Change in health service use from formal and informal sources at T2, T3, and T4 when compared to T1 will be assessed using the Resource Use Questionnaire (RUQ) and a purpose-designed measure respectively. The RUQ was adapted from the Young Mind Matters Service Use questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and assesses use of mental health professionals and services, mental health-related hospitalisations, medication use for mental health reasons, and school-based mental health services. These data will also be used for the economic evaluation.</p>
                  <p id="Par93">Change in attitudes towards seeking help from adults at school, and attitudes towards overcoming secrecy barriers, at T2, T3, and T4 when compared to T1, will be assessed using scales derived from the previous US Sources of Strength trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and used in the Australian Sources of Strength trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Items are rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Items on these scales are summed, with higher scores reflecting more positive attitudes towards help-seeking from adults at school, or more positive intentions to get help for suicidal friends and resist requests for secrecy.</p>
                  <p id="Par94">Change in perceived ability and intention to intervene with a suicidal person at T2, T3, and T4 when compared to T1 will be assessed using the Perceived Behavioural Control and Intention subscales of the Willingness to Intervene Against Suicide Questionnaire (WIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The scales have 20 and 22 items respectively. Both are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”). Items 1, 3, 5, 10, 14, and 16 on the Perceived Behavioural Control subscale and items 12, 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the Intentions subscale are reverse-scored. The potential range of scores is 20–100 and 22–100 respectively; a higher score indicates a higher endorsement of intervening.</p>
                  <p id="Par95">Change in stigma towards suicide at T2, T3, and T4 when compared to T1 will be assessed using the Stigma of Suicide Scale (SOSS)—Short Form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. This measure contains 16 one- or two-word descriptors of people who die by suicide, and respondents are asked to rate their level of agreement with each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”). The mean response to all items is calculated to score this instrument, with higher mean scores indicating greater suicide stigma.</p>
                  <p id="Par96">Change in suicide literacy at T2, T3, and T4 when compared to T1 will be assessed using the Literacy of Suicide Scale (LOSS)—Short Form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

The CHU9D is a multi-attribute utility instrument suitable for young people aged 7–17 years. It comprises a short questionnaire alongside a set of preference weights using general population values. The questionnaire has nine items with five response levels per item and can be used to derive quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for use in a cost-utility analysis (i.e. the economic evaluation).</p>

                  <p id="Par98">To characterise the sample at baseline, participants will be administered a standard demographic questionnaire. They will also be asked about any previous mental health diagnoses, exposure to suicide in others, and any previous suicide prevention training undertaken.</p>
                  <p id="Par99">At each time point, participants will be asked about their history of suicide planning and attempt, using the four suicide items from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. These yes/no items assess if the respondent has had suicidal ideation or made a suicide plan or attempt (and its seriousness) during the past 12 months at baseline, or in the period between assessment points.</p>
                  <p id="Par100">Participant views on the safeTALK workshop, including whether or not they thought it was “enjoyable”, “upsetting”, and “worthwhile”, will be assessed at T2 only using seven purpose-designed items. Participant views on the Reframe IT intervention (or for those in the control group, acceptability of <italic>not</italic> receiving Reframe IT) will be assessed using 11 purpose-designed items at T3 only.</p>
                  <p id="Par101">Finally, three additional scales will be used that are not directly related to the aims of the present study. First, the Distress Questionnaire—5 (DQ-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] will be administered at T1 to facilitate future comparison of data with another trial of a school-based suicide prevention programme in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The DQ-5 is a 5-item measure of distress, wherein participants are asked to specify on a 5-point scale, from 1 (“never”) to 5 (“always”), how frequently they have experienced certain indicators of distress over the past 30 days. The potential range of scores is 5–25, with higher scores indicating a greater level of distress. Next, two scales will be included as part of a larger study conducted by researchers in Europe examining whether participating in suicide prevention research is associated with distress. The first is the Patient Health Questionnaire—4 item version (PHQ-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], a screener of anxiety and depression symptoms. As two of the items are included in the PHQ-9, only the remaining two items (“how often have you been bothered by feeling nervous, anxious or on edge”; “how often have you been bothered by not being able to stop or control worrying”) will be added to the T1 questionnaire only. The second scale is a purpose-designed 11-item scale to assess experimentally induced distress, which will be administered at T4. It includes two subscales: experimentally induced distress in absolute terms (i.e. participation was distressing) and in relative terms (i.e. participation was more distressing than everyday life events). This scale was adapted from Yeater, Miller, Rinehart, and Nason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p>

                <title>Sample size and power calculation</title>
                <p id="Par102">The critical power calculation for this study relates to Component 2 (RCT of Reframe IT). The primary outcome variable for Reframe IT is reduced suicidal ideation, measured by the SIDAS, at 24 weeks (T4), in comparison to SIDAS scores at Time 2.</p>
                <p id="Par103">The Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] was used in the Reframe IT pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The SIQ and SIDAS are both continuous self-report measures of the frequency of cognitions related to suicide within the past month, with higher scores corresponding to more frequent and severe suicidal ideation. The range of the SIDAS is 0–50 and the range of the SIQ is 0–180. A SIDAS score of 1 or more indicates “risk for suicide”, whereas a SIQ score of 41 or more indicates “need for further evaluation of psychopathology”. As the SIQ licence is too expensive to use on a large scale, the SIDAS is being used in its place. In the absence of pilot data for the SIDAS, the power calculation is based on the SIQ. This can be reasonably justified given the similarities between the measures and their cut-offs and has been calculated in consultation with the study statistician.</p>
                <p id="Par104">In the Reframe IT pilot study, there were three time points of data collection (corresponding to T2, T3, and T4 as labelled in the current study). The mean reduction in SIQ between T1 and T3 (i.e. corresponding to T2 and T4 in the present study) for the pilot control group was 61.6 points (SD = 42.3) and for the pilot intervention group this was 47.1 points (SD = 41.6). The difference between these two reductions was 14.5 points. We also observed an intra-class correlation of 0.023 within schools, which gives a design effect of 1.1. Using these data, and making the conservative assumption that there is no correlation between SIQ scores within individuals over time, a 5% significance level and 80% power means that a sample size of 134 per arm (268 in total) is required.</p>
                <p id="Par105">Based on pilot data, and in consideration of the self-reported nature of the data collected, we estimate that, to recruit the required 268 students, we need to screen 4020 students (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is based on 20% drop-out rate among those who are classed as high-risk, consenting, and randomised; 33% of those identified as high-risk consenting to participate in the trial and being randomised (335 consenting and randomised, and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis); and 25% of the total sample endorsing suicidal ideation within the past month (1005 students). There are 141 mainstream secondary schools in the region and approximately 140 year 10 students per school. It is therefore estimated that approximately 29 schools will be recruited in total, although this number may fluctuate depending on the rate of student recruitment. Schools will be recruited in batches throughout the project. If the target sample size is reached before the 29 schools have been recruited, no further schools will be recruited. Similarly, if we recruit the target 29 schools but fail to recruit the required number of participants, more schools will be invited to participate. In the event that we struggle to meet the recruitment target, or if it is unfeasible to recruit year 10 students at a particular school, year 11 students may also be recruited.

                <p id="Par106">Recruitment numbers will be monitored closely by the study team and the Sponsor. If it becomes apparent that we are not on track to meet our recruitment target, the study team will meet to discuss alternative recruitment measures. Recruitment rate success will be formally assessed every 6 months. The relevant ethics committees will be notified in the case of any proposed amendments to the protocol.</p>

The allocation ratio will be 1:1. The randomisation schedule is computer generated by independent Information Technology (IT) personnel with guidance from the study statistician. The schedule will then be implemented by a member of the study team (other than the statistician) into the REDCap database management software for allocating treatments to individual students.</p>
                <p id="Par108">A member of the study team will inform school wellbeing staff of the outcome of randomisation, and they will then inform students. With the exception of the study statistician, study team members are not blind to the treatment allocations. The study statistician will not have access to the randomisation component of the database and will not be told about the treatment allocations, and will therefore remain blinded. As the study statistician will not be involved in any aspect of this study operations other than data analysis, there are no circumstances we could foresee under which the study statistician would be required to be unblinded.</p>

A modelled economic evaluation will also be undertaken using the results of this trial and relevant epidemiological literature to extrapolate long-term costs and consequences that are not fully captured within the trial. The economic evaluation will comprise both a cost-utility analysis and a cost-consequences analysis. The cost-utility analysis will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in terms of the cost per QALY, where costs are estimated using the RUQ and QALYs are measured using the CHU9D. A cost-consequences analysis will also be conducted to compare the incremental costs of the intervention to the full spectrum of outcomes included in the study (i.e. change in suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and problem-solving capability). This will produce a set of alternative cost-effectiveness ratios, an approach that has been deemed useful by decision-makers. The economic evaluation will be primarily conducted using the health sector perspective. A broader societal perspective will also be undertaken in a secondary analysis. The evaluation will first measure and value any change to the use of health care resources over the period of the study between the two arms of the trial (intervention and control) and then compare any additional costs to other outcomes achieved.</p>

                <p id="Par115">The organisational structure of this trial is as follows. The MAPSS steering committee is comprised of the CI, project manager, and clinical supervisor and is responsible for investigator oversight of the MAPSS project. The MAPSS steering committee meet on a fortnightly basis. The MAPSS Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC—Equivalent to the Data Safety and Management Committee (DSMC)) is the main vehicle for safety management, data monitoring, endpoint adjudication, and data management strategy. This committee is comprised of the CI, project manager, as well as independent internal and external subject matter experts including the Sponsor. The composition of the group was designed to incorporate transparency and so that no one set of competing interests could unduly influence other stakeholders, and is appropriate for this non-commercially funded or sponsored study. This committee has a dual safety role: it incorporates a risk-appropriate safety, endpoint adjudication, and data management strategy which is responsive to study issues as they eventuate. The committee meets on a quarterly basis and on an ad hoc basis when deemed necessary by the steering committee. The charter for this committee is outlined in the SMC manual, available upon reasonable request by contacting the corresponding author.</p>
                <p id="Par116">A comprehensive safety protocol has been developed, which will be activated if: (1) participants return a score of 1 or higher on the SIDAS at any time-point (the established cut-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] indicating any level of suicidal ideation in the past month); (2) participants report current suicidal ideation at any time-point; (3) participants report suicide risk via the Reframe IT platform. Where possible, the school will be responsible for checking in with the participant and managing any risk, although in some cases researchers will assist with this (e.g. where the school does not have the capacity to follow up with students in a timely way). If this is required, the researcher will contact the participant by phone and conduct a brief risk assessment. The response will depend on the level of risk, and ranges from providing the participant with contact information for helplines (in the case of low risk) to calling the participant’s emergency contact or emergency services (in the case of high-severe risk). All participants will be required to provide emergency contact information via the consent form. Ultimately, all risk information will be communicated to the school, who will be responsible for ongoing management. There are no planned interim analyses for this study, nor are there any stopping guidelines other than as outlined in section “<xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">Study discontinuation criteria</xref>” of this protocol.</p>

In line with international best practice, this large-scale study will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a suicide prevention programme comprising universal, selective, and indicated components delivered in secondary school settings. We hypothesise that this programme will reduce suicide risk, improve risk recognition, and increase health service use among participants. The study is being conducted in partnership with the Department of Education in Victoria, so if found to be efficacious, safe, and cost-effective, the programme will not only contribute to a much-needed evidence-base, but would also have the potential to become embedded into standard school curricula and rolled out in school settings more broadly.</p>
