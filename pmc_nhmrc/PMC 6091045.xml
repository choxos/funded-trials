                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">In Australia there is commitment to developing interventions that will ‘Close the Gap’ between the health and welfare of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and recognition that early childhood interventions offer the greatest potential for long term change. Nurse led sustained home visiting programs are considered an effective way to deliver a health and parenting service, however there is little international or Australian evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of these programs for Aboriginal infants. This protocol describes the Bulundidi Gudaga Study, a quasi-experimental design, comparing three cohorts of families from the Macarthur region in south western Sydney to explore the effectiveness of the Maternal Early Childhood Sustained Home-visiting (MECSH) program for Aboriginal families.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Mothers were recruited when booking into the local hospital for perinatal care and families are followed up until child is age 4 years. Participants are from three distinct cohorts: Aboriginal MECSH intervention cohort (Group A), Non-Aboriginal MECSH intervention cohort (Group B) and Aboriginal non-intervention cohort (Group C). Eligible mothers were those identified as at risk during the Safe Start assessment conducted by antenatal clinic midwives. Mothers in Group A were eligible if they were pregnant with an Aboriginal infant. Mothers in Group B were eligible if they were pregnant with a non-Aboriginal infant. Mothers in Group C are part of the Gudaga descriptive cohort study and were recruited between October 2005 and May 2007. The difference in duration of breastfeeding, child body mass index, and child development outcomes at 18 months and 4 years of age will be measured as primary outcomes. We will also evaluate the intervention effect on secondary measures including: child dental health; the way the program is received; patterns of child health and illness; patterns of maternal health, health knowledge and behaviours; family and environmental conditions; and service usage for mothers and families.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Involving local Aboriginal research and intervention staff and investing in established relationships between the research team and the local Aboriginal community is enabling this study to generate evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions that are feasible to implement and sustainable in the context of Aboriginal communities and local service systems.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par16">Indigenous children in Australia have some of the poorest health and welfare outcomes in the OECD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Australia there is a commitment to developing interventions that will ‘Close the Gap’ between the health and welfare of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and recognition that early childhood interventions offer the greatest potential for long term change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Early childhood home visiting has been adopted as a key strategy. However the applicability and effectiveness of home visiting interventions has not been demonstrated with Indigenous families, particularly in urban environments.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Over the past decades, a number of interventions have been developed to improve birth outcomes for Indigenous infants. For example, in the Strong Women Strong Babies Strong Culture program in the Northern Territory senior community women visited pregnant Indigenous women to improve attendance at antenatal services and maternal health knowledge and behaviour, with mixed results in four communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Ngua Gundi program in Rockhampton, Queensland, provided antenatal home visiting, some postnatal home visiting and support for postnatal groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and whilst there is evaluation evidence that the women liked the program, outcomes have not been published. Also in Queensland the evaluation of the Townsville Mums and Bubs program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] provides an integrated model of antenatal shared care and has demonstrated improved early presentation for antenatal care, increased number of antenatal visits, and reduced rate of pre-term births, however, birth weight and rates of perinatal mortality were unchanged. The NSW Aboriginal Maternal Infant Health Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] employs a midwife and Aboriginal Health Worker to provide community-based antenatal services for Aboriginal women, and has demonstrated results similar to the Townsville program. In contrast to the antenatal focus of these programs, the South Australian Family Home Visiting program includes targeting of inter alia families of Indigenous infants and commences postnatally, continuing to child-age 2 years. This service, delivered by mainstream (non-Indigenous) child health nurses has been shown to be acceptable to families and achieved some positive outcomes in parent feelings of attachment and parental role satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. None of these programs, however, provides the continuity of care through pregnancy, infancy and early childhood that has been demonstrated to be effective in trials of sustained nurse home visiting (SNHV) in non-Indigenous populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Home visiting programs comprising intensive, structured and sustained visits by professionals (usually nurses) commencing antenatally and continuing over the first two years of life show promise in promoting child health and family functioning, and ameliorating disadvantage. When supported by SNHV, trials (predominantly overseas with non-Indigenous communities) have shown a positive effect on parenting attitudes and behaviours and on child cognitive and socioemotional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This international evidence, however, comes mainly from tightly controlled efficacy trials; much less has been documented about the effectiveness of such programs in practice in the Australian context.</p>
              <p id="Par19">SNHV is now a key government strategy to ‘Close the Gap’ in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians with both State and Federal governments investing in improved maternal and child health services for Indigenous families. For example, the Federal Government has invested over $37 million in implementing the Nurse Family Partnership model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for Aboriginal families, which has been subject to a formative evaluation only. There is little international or Australian evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of SNHV for Indigenous infants.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The Maternal (formerly Miller) Early Childhood Sustained Home-visiting (MECSH) program is an Australian-developed structured program of sustained nurse home visiting commencing antenatally and continuing through to child-age 2 years. MECSH is focused on: children’s health and development; parental aspirations for themselves and their child/ren, and a structured child development parent education program. A key strategy is continuity of the nurse home visitor. A randomised trial of the MECSH program, delivered by child health nurses within the context of existing community health service structures, has demonstrated effectiveness in improving the health, health behaviours and the quality of the home environment for children’s development of mothers assessed antenatally as having risk of poorer maternal and/or child outcomes living in a disadvantaged multicultural community in south western Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Seventeen (8.5%) of the children in the MECSH trial were from Aboriginal families (note: ‘Aboriginal’ is the preferred term for description of Indigenous persons in NSW). The mothers of Aboriginal children who received the MECSH intervention were highly satisfied with the program, had a rate of retention in the study equivalent to mothers of non-Aboriginal children, and, although not statistically demonstrable, reported positive outcomes in duration of breastfeeding and child development at 18 months compared with Aboriginal mothers in the comparison, non-intervention group. These data suggest that the MECSH program may be an appropriate strategy to improve the health and development of Aboriginal children. The current study is applying this experience gained from the MECSH study, together with the knowledge of the issues for families of Aboriginal infants in an urban community gained from the Gudaga cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], to determine whether SNHV is effective in “Closing the Gap” for urban Aboriginal families, measuring both proximal outcomes during and at the conclusion of the intervention at child age 2 years, and also longer-term post-intervention outcomes during the pre-school years.</p>
              <p id="Par21">This study is thus generating Australian evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions that are feasible to implement and sustainable in the context of the local service systems. The interventions aim to reduce the impact of social and environmental factors predisposing urban Aboriginal infants and children to ill health and reducing their life potential. This study is the first study internationally to examine the immediate and longer-term effectiveness of a comprehensive SNHV program commencing antenatally and continuing to child-age 2 years for families of Indigenous infants, with follow-up to child age 4 years.</p>

                <p id="Par36">The study is being conducted in the Macarthur region of south-western Sydney, Australia. The Macarthur region (Campbelltown, Camden and Wollondilly local government areas) has one of the largest Aboriginal populations in New South Wales (NSW) comprising 8337 people: 3.3% of the regional population of 254,219 and 4.0% of the state Aboriginal population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>

Interventions that seek to achieve the outcome of healthier children need to also address the health of parents (particularly mothers), family and social functioning, and the environment. The intervention and research also recognises Aboriginal frameworks for reciprocity, respect, equality and responsibility; recognising that the researchers, SNHV program providers and the families all contribute; and that contribution is respected, recognised and valued. The study is conducted in a culturally safe environment through the involvement of Aboriginal research and intervention staff and behaviour that maintains coherence of Aboriginal values and cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and investment in established relationships between the research team and the local Aboriginal community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par38">The study uses a quasi-experimental design comparing three cohorts of families to explore the effectiveness of SNHV for Aboriginal families. The study design recognises that the use of a randomised control group design is inappropriate in the context of this research. There was apprehension within the Aboriginal community about randomisation associated with equity and the investigators wished to demonstrate a respect for the views of the local Aboriginal community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], based on discussions with local Aboriginal representatives.</p>

The nurse was supported by a social worker, and all nurses working with Aboriginal families were also supported by Aboriginal Health Workers. All intervention staff (nurses, Aboriginal health workers and social worker) received additional training in the program model and cultural competency. The MECSH program home visits were standardised as follows:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par60">A minimum of three antenatal home visits and postnatal visits within one week of birth, and then at least weekly until 6 weeks; second weekly until 12 weeks; monthly to 6 months; bi-monthly until 2 years.

                <p id="Par70">The MECSH program was adapted to provide a culturally appropriate intervention for Aboriginal families. In 2008, a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] was undertaken in consultation with the local Aboriginal community, the Aboriginal medical service and the community health service, to identify and mitigate any aspects of the MECSH intervention that may impact negatively on Aboriginal families.

                <p id="Par71">Program documentation (minutes of staff meetings, procedures and protocols, training) were continually reviewed to identify: barriers and facilitators to the uptake and retention in the intervention program, cultural adaptation, workforce skills training, and monitoring of supervision needs and workload; actively promoting links between health home visiting, child protection services, and non-government agencies. Nurses completed checklists on completion of each home visit, detailing the interventions and tasks undertaken. The collated data were used to identify the content of interventions related to the age of the child for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal families, and to provide ongoing quality feedback to the intervention team.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par78">This study is the first Australian trial of the effectiveness of sustained nurse home visiting for families of Aboriginal infants, and one of few conducted worldwide with Indigenous communities. Comparison with an historical non-intervention cohort of Aboriginal infants will allow assessment of the effectiveness of the intervention compared with usual care. In addition, enrolment of a contemporary study cohort of families of non-Aboriginal infants who also received sustained nurse home visiting provided by the same local health service provider in the same community will allow assessment of whether this intervention can ‘close the gap’ that exists in the health and development of Australian Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.</p>
              <p id="Par79">The intervention was based in the local public community health service and utilised the mainstream child and family health nurses and social workers, with the addition of Aboriginal Health Workers for the Aboriginal families receiving the intervention. By trialing the effectiveness of mainstream service provision for this population, the program is more likely to be replicable at the whole of population level than programs relying on provision by only Indigenous staff, who are considerably underrepresented in Australian child and family health professions.</p>
              <p id="Par80">The research is being conducted in partnership with the local service providers and Aboriginal community, who will support the communication of the study results through professional and community events, policy briefings and joint publications.</p>
              <p id="Par81">A significant limitation of the study was the number of families recruited to participate. Participation was limited by the maximum caseload that could be assigned to the number of trained program nurses. This limitation on recruitment numbers was further exacerbated by poorer than predicted retention rates in the intervention cohorts, and the Aboriginal intervention cohort in particular. Unfortunately, intervention participation could only be maintained for those who continually resided in the local area for the duration of the study, unlike the historical non-intervention group whose participation was not associated with an intervention. As has been the case with other home visiting research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], attrition mainly occurred early in the research, predominantly in the antenatal period and the first month post-birth. This loss of participants was particularly high for the Aboriginal intervention group (Group A), with an overall loss of 30% of participants at those times. There is evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] that in urban locations the Indigenous population is more mobile than the non-Indigenous population, and that Indigenous women are most mobile in young adulthood up to 30 years of age; the main age group in this study. The loss of participants in the perinatal period may reflect such mobility. The much higher retention rate in the historic cohort (80% at child-age 2 years) may also reflect postnatal study recruitment, rather than antenatal recruitment as in the case of the intervention groups, and therefore may not be fully indicative of the number of Aboriginal women presenting for antenatal care in the recruiting hospital. The low rates of participation at each data point may reduce the power of the study to detect small and moderate effects of the intervention. This may be moderated by the collection of the same data items at multiple data points, which should facilitate imputation of values for data points missed by individual participants and the use of multilevel analyses, however, this will remain a limitation for cross-sectional analyses.</p>
              <p id="Par82">Inferences about outcome differences between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal intervention groups may also be affected by the differences in the demographic and risk profile of the participating families. It was possible to match Groups A and B on maternal age, but not on suburb of residence, with Group A (like historic Group C) more likely to live in low socio-economic areas. There were also considerable issues of inconsistency in the routine Safe Start [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] assessment conducted by antenatal clinic midwives in either the asking, or recording of risk factors and vulnerabilities between the groups. Group B (non-Aboriginal intervention group) were much less likely to have an answer recorded regarding whether they had been abused as a child, or about mental health issues, whilst Group A (Aboriginal intervention group) were less likely to have data recorded about substance misuse. There also seems to have been a temporal change in recording of family violence with both current groups (A and B) being less likely to have these data recorded than the historic group (C Aboriginal non-intervention group). Propensity scoring will be used to correct recorded differences. For the purposes of identifying families to be offered the intervention, however, the assumption was made that non-recording of the vulnerability factor was an indicator of the absence of the risk. It is not possible to know whether the mother was not asked or whether she was asked and the factor was absent and hence not recorded.</p>
              <p id="Par83">The ‘Bulundidi Gudaga’ trial has been designed to provide Australian evidence of whether a sustained nurse home visiting intervention, adapted to meet the needs and preferences of an urban Aboriginal population and delivered by local public community health services, can improve outcomes for Aboriginal children and their families, and close the gap between them and their non-Aboriginal contemporaries. Although limited by the sample size and study retention and participation rates, it is envisaged that the comprehensive, culturally adapted intervention will support significant child health and development improvements that are sustained beyond the 2 year intervention to child age 4 years.</p>
