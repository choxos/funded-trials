                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Anaemia affects 46% of pregnancies in Africa; oral iron is recommended by WHO but uptake and adherence are suboptimal. We tested a single dose of a modern intravenous iron formulation, ferric carboxymaltose, for anaemia treatment in Malawian pregnant women.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this open-label, individually randomised controlled trial, we enrolled women with a singleton pregnancy of 13–26 weeks' gestation in primary care and outpatient settings across two regions in southern Malawi. Women were eligible if they had capillary haemoglobin of less than 10·0 g/dL and negative malaria rapid diagnostic test. Participants were randomised by sealed envelope 1:1. Assessors for efficacy outcomes (laboratory parameters and birthweight) were masked to intervention; participants and study nurses were not masked. Participants were given ferric carboxymaltose up to 1000 mg (given once at enrolment in an outpatient primary care setting), or standard of care (60 mg elemental iron twice daily for 90 days), along with intermittent preventive malaria treatment. The primary maternal outcome was anaemia at 36 weeks' gestation. The primary neonatal outcome was birthweight. Analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population for mothers and liveborn neonates, according to their randomisation group. Safety outcomes included incidence of adverse events during infusion and all adverse events from randomisation to 4 weeks' post partum. The trial is registered with ANZCTR, ACTRN12618001268235. The trial has completed follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Nov 12, 2018, and March 2, 2021, 21 258 women were screened, and 862 randomly assigned to ferric carboxymaltose (n=430) or standard of care (n=432). Ferric carboxymaltose did not reduce anaemia prevalence at 36 weeks' gestation compared with standard of care (179 [52%] of 341 in the ferric carboxymaltose group <italic>vs</italic> 189 [57%] of 333 in the standard of care group; prevalence ratio [PR] 0·92, 95% CI 0·81 to 1·06; p=0·27). Anaemia prevalence was numerically lower in mothers randomly assigned to ferric carboxymaltose compared with standard of care at all timepoints, although significance was only observed at 4 weeks' post-treatment (PR 0·91 [0·85 to 0·97]). Birthweight did not differ between groups (mean difference –3·1 g [–75·0 to 68·9, p=0·93). There were no infusion-related serious adverse events or differences in adverse events by any organ class (including malaria; ≥1 adverse event: ferric carboxymaltose 183 [43%] of 430 <italic>vs</italic> standard of care 170 [39%] of 432; risk ratio 1·08 [0·92 to 1·27]; p=0·34).</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">A search of PubMed for “intravenous iron” AND “pregnancy” OR “antenatal” identified nine systematic reviews, which contained limited trial data available from low-income countries or modern intravenous formulations such as ferric carboxymaltose that enable high-dose iron replacement. The search was from database inception to August, 2022. There were no language restrictions. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 trials comparing intravenous iron with oral iron in pregnancy identified advantages from intravenous iron on haematology (intravenous iron therapy led to higher maternal haemoglobin at delivery; mean difference 7·4 g/L [95% CI 3·9–11]; nine RCTs, low-quality evidence) and iron status (ferritin: mean difference 21·2 μg/L [95% CI 6·5–36·0]; three randomised controlled trials [RCTs], low-quality evidence); and low-quality evidence of the benefits on birthweight and need for blood transfusion. A network meta-analysis compared different formulations of iron in pregnancy and identified advantages from intravenous iron over oral formulations of iron in increasing haemoglobin concentration 4 weeks' post-administration (but did not evaluate this outcome before delivery). Older reviews compiled evidence indicating iron sucrose (which can only be given in low doses) provides superior haematologic and iron status outcomes compared with oral iron. We also searched all trials using ferric carboxymaltose in resource-limited settings. Only one trial assessed the use of ferric carboxymaltose in low-income settings: a study in Tanzania recruited 230 randomly assigned post-partum women to oral iron or ferric carboxymaltose and showed that women receiving the intravenous formulation had higher haemoglobin concentrations over a 12-month period. Two RCTs comparing ferric carboxymaltose with oral iron in pregnancy have been conducted: the pivotal FER-ASAP trial recruited 232 pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia in high-income settings, and showed early superiority from ferric carboxymaltose over high-dose oral ferrous sulphate on haemoglobin concentrations, which was not sustained beyond the first 6 weeks; a smaller trial compared ferric carboxymaltose with oral iron (and intravenous iron polymaltose) in 246 pregnant women and likewise showed more rapid increases in haemoglobin and ferritin in the intravenous groups compared with oral iron. A large trial explored the use of an older intravenous iron formulation (iron sucrose) for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy in India: iron sucrose is limited by the low dose that can be delivered in a single infusion, necessitating recurrent visits.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">To our knowledge, the randomised trial of intravenous iron for anaemia in Malawian pregnant women (REVAMP) is the first trial to compare a modern intravenous iron formulation capable of rapidly delivering a high dose of iron over a short infusion timeframe to standard of care oral iron to treat antenatal anaemia in a low-income setting, and is also the largest trial to date of ferric carboxymaltose in pregnancy. The trial inclusion criteria were simple and designed to enable translation of results to practice in resource-limited settings. REVAMP recruited a sample size almost times the size of the pivotal FER-ASAP trial. REVAMP shows the feasibility and safety of ferric carboxymaltose in a low-income, primary-care setting where infectious exposures are intense. Our data indicate that compared with oral iron, ferric carboxymaltose markedly reduces iron deficiency anaemia for the duration of pregnancy and into the post-partum, and provides a more rapid elevation in haemoglobin concentration (over oral iron); although this advantage might not be sustained by delivery. Moreover, our data highlight the complex determinants of anaemia in this setting.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para100">Compared with oral iron, ferric carboxymaltose produced a profound reduction in iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia, and a more rapid early haematologic response. However, there was no reduction in anaemia prevalence before delivery among the overall cohort; nor did we identify functional benefits from intravenous iron, even though the study population had a high burden of maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications (eg, low birthweight and post-partum haemorrhage). Although the trial was negative for the primary outcome, REVAMP provides new information on urgent technological needs (eg, field-friendly iron status screening), and potential future important contexts for this intervention (women in the third trimester of pregnancy, settings without malaria).</p>

              </p>
              <p id="para110">Ferric carboxymaltose could present an option to treat anaemia in pregnancy in low-income settings, but the efficacy and safety of this approach in these settings are unproven. We therefore conducted a randomised controlled trial to determine whether a single dose of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose would be superior to standard-of-care (oral iron) in reducing anaemia prevalence at 36 weeks' gestation (before delivery), improve other maternal and neonatal outcomes (including birthweight), and be safe for Malawian women in their second trimester of pregnancy with moderate or severe anaemia (by capillary haemoglobin measurement) and without detectable <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasitemia (by RDT).</p>

                <p id="para130">Participants were eligible for the trial if they had a capillary haemoglobin concentration below 10·0 g/dL (moderate or severe anaemia) measured by HemoCue 301+ (HemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden), were <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasitemia negative (RDT), had a confirmed singleton pregnancy of 13–26 weeks' gestation, had no diagnosed inherited red cell disorder, and were not clinically judged to require transfusion or have another acute medical illness.

We used capillary haemoglobin measurement as we judged that widespread screening with venous blood for measurement of haemoglobin and iron indices is not presently feasible in resource-limited primary-care settings and, if used, would limit the generalisability of results. HIV positivity was not an exclusion.</p>

                <p id="para160">Women assigned to the intervention group received a single dose of ferric carboxymaltose (Vifor Pharma, purchased commercially) at 20 mg/kg (up to 1000 mg) diluted in 250 mL normal saline, administered intravenously over 15 mins, at the enrolment visit. Ferric carboxymaltose was infused by study nurses according to a standard operating procedure (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 2–10</xref>) in treatment rooms equipped to manage allergic reactions—ie, with medications, fluids, airway equipment, and oxygen. Women in the standard of care group were provided with oral iron (60 mg elemental iron as ferrous sulphate, twice daily for 90 days) accompanied by a similar educational message to what local providers would give. All participants received intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) at enrolment, 28 days later, and at 36 weeks' gestation unless contraindicated (eg, recent malaria therapy or HIV positive on cotrimoxazole).</p>
                <p id="para170">Participants were followed up at scheduled visits at 28 days' post-enrolment, 36 weeks' gestation, delivery, and 4 weeks' post partum. Home visits were also scheduled fortnightly at 34, 38, and 40 weeks' gestation to collect capillary haemoglobin and count residual oral iron tablets (control group). During the trial, the study offered a 7-day-a-week service for participants, in which mothers could present for diagnosis and treatment of any symptoms. Women could attend the study centres for unscheduled visits if they became unwell. At each scheduled visit, women were also asked if they (or their neonate) had attended other health providers. This strategy enabled comprehensive capture of adverse events.</p>

Adherence to oral iron in the standard of care group was also to be monitored at the 34-week home visit. However, in May, 2020, home visits were cancelled to reduce the risk of study staff spreading SARS-CoV-2 in participants' villages. No unblinded data were seen before these changes. The trial protocol and registration were amended at the time of the change and reflected in the statistical analysis plan.</p>
                <p id="para190">Secondary maternal outcomes included anaemia at 4 weeks' post-infusion and at delivery (venous haemoglobin &lt;11·0 g/dL), and at 4 weeks' post partum (venous haemoglobin &lt;12·0 g/dL).

                <p id="para200">Safety outcomes included adverse events during ferric carboxymaltose infusion (assessed according to a checklist for women in the active group) and adverse events for any reason from randomisation to 4 weeks' post partum, including serious adverse events (eg, unplanned hospitalisation or death including pregnancy loss and neonatal death), clinical infection episodes, biochemical hypophosphataemia, and positive RDTs. We defined a composite severe maternal event as maternal death, intensive care admission, post-partum haemorrhage, or need for a blood transfusion. We reported abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death individually and as a combined outcome.</p>

For this reason, we analysed a post-hoc outcome: anaemia at 36 weeks' gestation or at delivery—whichever occurred sooner. Ferric carboxymaltose did not reduce the prevalence of anaemia at this post-hoc composite timepoint compared with standard of care (ferric carboxymaltose: 187 [52%] of 357 <italic>vs</italic> standard of care: 200 [56%] of 354, PR 0·93 [95% CI 0·81–1·06]).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para380">In resource-limited setting in sub-Saharan African, where adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are common and malaria is highly endemic, treatment of women with moderate or severe anaemia in the second trimester of pregnancy with a single dose of up to 1000 mg ferric carboxymaltose was not significantly superior to standard of care in improving the primary maternal outcome of anaemia at 36 weeks' gestation or the primary neonatal outcome of birthweight. However, ferric carboxymaltose reduced iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia. Ferric carboxymaltose might be more effective in increasing haemoglobin in women with baseline iron deficiency, although the statistical evidence for this interaction was not strong. In this resource-constrained primary-care setting where exposure to infectious diseases was intense, ferric carboxymaltose was safe.</p>
              <p id="para390">We used pragmatic eligibility criteria for the trial so that the results could be translated into practice. We reasoned that in resource-limited primary antenatal health-care, screening with venous blood currently represents an insurmountable transformation of practice, as laboratory screening for anaemia in any form is seldom performed. Discrepancies between capillary and venous haemoglobin assessments are recognised,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> but 85% of women exhibited moderate or severe anaemia and 95% exhibited anaemia by venous testing. Testing for ferritin or other biomarkers of iron status is generally unavailable in field settings in resource-limited settings. Ferric carboxymaltose was highly effective in reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia throughout pregnancy and into the post partum, but the benefit appears to have been diluted by an absence of effect for those with non-iron deficiency anaemia. Our study highlights a need for field-friendly testing capabilities for causes of anaemia, including iron status.</p>
              <p id="para400">Our findings highlight the complexity of the determinants of anaemia in this setting. Inflammation was present in more than half of women at baseline, despite testing negative for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> by RDT. In pregnancy, conventional RDTs for <italic>P falciparum</italic> might be insensitive, as parasites might sequester in the placenta.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Thus, participants who had a negative RDT potentially still harboured parasitaemia. Other causes of anaemia in this population might include haemoglobinopathies; we did not test for these at baseline but we did exclude women with a known history of an inherited red cell disorder. A cross-sectional study in Malawian children revealed that 10% of them harboured homozygote α<sup>3·7</sup> genotypes (which can cause mild anaemia) and about 10% carried the sickle cell gene (although this is unlikely to cause anaemia).<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Hookworm and schistosomiasis were not specifically treated in this trial, but might cause chronic blood loss that can contribute to iron deficiency in this population, and would be expected to be responsive to iron therapy.</p>
              <p id="para410">The reduction in iron deficiency produced by ferric carboxymaltose could potentially provide benefits to mothers and their babies independent of effects on anaemia. 2021 data indicate that universal iron interventions in 8-month-old infants do not improve cognitive outcomes,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> perhaps because iron deficiency affects brain development earlier in life. Maternofetal iron deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of neurocognitive and mental health disorders in the child, including poorer neurodevelopment and school performance, slower neural processing, difficulties with planning and attention, and increased risks of socioemotional problems including anxiety.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Studies exploring relationships between infant and childhood iron deficiency and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have largely been correlative and have found inconsistent evidence of association.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Therefore, it will be valuable to follow the cohort to determine whether children born to women receiving ferric carboxymaltose have improved developmental trajectories and altered risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
              <p id="para420">Despite iron therapy, and accounting for recurrent intermittent preventive therapy, approximately half of women remained anaemic by 36 weeks' gestation; this might relate to the ongoing high prevalence of inflammation (∼36%) seen at this timepoint, perhaps due to causes beyond malaria. Previous randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews have suggested a benefit from iron supplementation on birthweight.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Systemic inflammation might have distorted healthy maternal and placental iron homoeostasis in this population.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p>
              <p id="para430">Systematic reviews have indicated that intravenous iron might increase infection risk compared with oral iron (or no iron);<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> we noted a non-significant increase in infections (overall, and including malaria) among women randomly assigned to ferric carboxymaltose. Given concerns that iron-induced erythropoiesis might increase susceptibility to malaria,<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> we ensured that women had a negative RDT at recruitment, and that they received IPTp-SP. Antimalarials (as preventives or treatments) might have controlled parasitemia, reduced anaemia, and perhaps increased birthweight across both trial groups.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p>
              <p id="para440">Ferric carboxymaltose is known to induce transient hypophosphataemia due to FGF23-induced renal-phosphate losses;<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> we observed a small, transient increase in the prevalence of moderate hypophosphataemia. Hypophosphataemia might have been more marked before 28 days but in any case, the effect is transient. We did not observe any serious infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions in this study, and our field team was able to administer the drug in basic primary health centres remote from a hospital and without resources such as electricity. These initial experiences indicate that the use of ferric carboxymaltose could be feasible in sub-Saharan resource-limited settings.</p>
              <p id="para450">Several systematic reviews have indicated that intravenous iron is superior to oral iron in increasing haemoglobin and reducing anaemia prevalence during pregnancy; these reviews contain limited data from low-income countries, or from trials using modern intravenous formulations including ferric carboxymaltose.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> A network meta-analysis identified advantages from intravenous oral iron over oral iron formulations in increasing haemoglobin concentration 4 weeks' post-administration (but did not report this outcome closer to delivery).<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> Few randomised trials have assessed the use of ferric carboxymaltose in low-income settings: a small study in Tanzania randomly assigned iron deficient anaemic post-partum women to oral iron or ferric carboxymaltose, and showed that sustained haemoglobin increases from ferric carboxymaltose.<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> The FER-ASAP trial recruited iron-deficient anaemic pregnant women in high-income and middle-income settings and showed early superiority from ferric carboxymaltose over oral iron on haemoglobin concentrations, which were not sustained beyond 6 weeks.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Our study is the largest trial to compare ferric carboxymaltose (or other modern iron formulations) to standard of care in pregnancy, the first in a resource-limited malaria-endemic setting, and the first to assess post-partum effects of antenatal ferric carboxymaltose.</p>
              <p id="para460">Hepcidin regulates iron access to the plasma from the diet and the reticuloendothelial system.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> In pregnancy, maternal hepcidin is suppressed to facilitate increased absorption and use and to support expanded maternal erythropoiesis and fetal iron requirements. Homoeostatatic iron-induced hepcidin upregulation appears to be blunted during pregnancy,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> but upregulation due to inflammation seems preserved.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Assessment of hepcidin levels as a potential biomarker of response to ferric carboxymaltose in this population, and the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (compared with oral iron) on hepcidin in this setting with an interacting burden of inflammation will be an important exploratory post-hoc substudy of this trial. The standard of care group comprised twice daily oral iron as ferrous sulphate, which is aligned with WHO and Malawian guidelines; stable isotope studies in non-pregnant women suggest daily oral iron might offer more efficient absorption,<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> although physiology might differ in pregnancy. Ongoing support to enhance antenatal oral iron programmes should continue.</p>
              <p id="para470">Our trial has several strengths, and included women who face a high risk of adverse antenatal and perinatal outcomes (for whom optimising pregnancy outcomes is most crucial) using pragmatic eligibility criteria that could be implemented in the field. Limitations in our study design include the open-label design, but since ferric carboxymaltose is a dark solution, administering intravenous placebo would require a curtain, blindfold, or opaque tubing. Key efficacy outcomes were measured by masked personnel. Several major trials of intravenous iron in high-income settings, such as the IRONMAN study testing iron derisomaltose in heart failure<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> and the FER-ASAP trial,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> similarly adopted an open-label design due to complexities of a placebo. Our study design was compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated urgent amendments to protect participants and their communities, resulting in changes to the primary outcome and limited ability to assess adherence in the control group. Women might also have concealed poor adherence to oral tablets to meet the expectations of health workes.<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> The pandemic probably also affected follow-up: when reasons were given, COVID-19 concerns were the main reason cited by participants for missing scheduled visits. We used C-reactive protein as the sole biomarker to adjust ferritin for inflammation, and to estimate prevalence of inflammation. C-reactive protein is elevated in chronic inflammation and transiently after acute inflammation; use of a biomarker exhibiting sustained elevation after inflammation (such as α<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein) might have indicated a higher prevalence of inflammation, but also uncovered a higher prevalence of iron deficiency.<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> Defining inflammation using a higher C-reactive protein threshold would have correspondingly reduced prevalence of inflammation. Health economic analyses of the trial are planned. At present, ferric carboxymaltose remains expensive; cheaper solutions will need to be developed to enable programmes to be cost effective.</p>
              <p id="para480">Ferric carboxymaltose can feasibly be delivered safely in resource-poor contexts where infection risk is high. Further exploration of the role that ferric carboxymaltose might play as part of the solution to the complex determinants of anaemia in sub-Saharan Africa is warranted.</p>
