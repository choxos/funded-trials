                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Efficacious programmes require implementation at scale to maximise their public health impact. <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> is an efficacious behavioural and environmental intervention for increasing primary (elementary) school childrenâ€™s (5â€“12 years) physical activity and reducing their sedentary behaviour within school and home settings. This paper describes the study protocol of a 5-year effectivenessâ€“implementation trial to assess the scalability and effectiveness of the <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> programme.</p>

                  <p>A type II hybrid implementationâ€“effectiveness trial, <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> is being disseminated to all primary schools in the state of Victoria, Australia (n=1786). Data are being collected using mixed methods at the system (state government, partner organisations), organisation (school) and individual (teacher, parent and child) levels. Evaluation is based on programme Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. RE-AIM domains are being measured using a quasi-experimental, pre/post, non-equivalent group design, at baseline, 12 and 24â€‰months. Effectiveness will be determined in a subsample of 20 intervention schools (in Victoria) and 20 control schools (in New South Wales (NSW), Australia), at baseline, 12 and 24â€‰months. Primary outcomes include <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> Reach, Adoption, Implementation and organisational Maintenance (implementation trial), and childrenâ€™s physical activity and sedentary time assessed using accelerometers (effectiveness trial). Secondary outcomes include average sedentary time and moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity on weekdays and during school hours, body mass index z-scores and waist circumference (effectiveness trial). Linear mixed-effects models will be fitted to compare outcomes between intervention and control participants accounting for clustering of children within schools, confounding and random effects.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Regular physical activity is beneficial for childrenâ€™s cardiometabolic health (including lipids, adiposity and blood pressure)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and mental health.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Physical activity has also been positively associated with academic results, including cognitive skills (eg, executive functioning, attention, memory, comprehension), attitude (eg, motivation, self-concept, satisfaction and enjoyment), academic behaviour (eg, organisation), engagement in learning (eg, on-task time) and academic achievement (eg, standardised test scores).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3â€“5</xref> Few studies have examined the impact of prolonged sitting on childrenâ€™s health, with the evidence still primarily observational and indeterminate.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While there is currently insufficient evidence for a doseâ€“response relationship between sedentary behaviour (defined as any waking behaviour characterised by an energy expenditure â‰¤1.5 metabolic equivalents while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and health outcomes in children and adolescents (aged 5â€“17 years), greater time spent sedentary has been linked to poorer health outcomes such as lower fitness, and poorer cardiometabolic and mental health in this population.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> There is some evidence that breaking up sedentary time may improve cognitive outcomes in children.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>In Australia, only 26% of children aged 5â€“12 years meet the government recommendation of at least 1â€‰hour of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) every day.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> As part of the Australian 24-hour movement guidelines for children and young people (5â€“17 years) which integrate physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep, it is recommended that children reduce and break up prolonged sitting throughout the day.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> More than 60% of childrenâ€™s class time is spent sitting<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and only 25â€“30% of morning recess and lunch breaks at school are spent in MVPA.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Comprehensive school physical activity programmes that use whole-of-school approaches to promote activity and adopt active school environments (ie, active classrooms, active environments, quality physical education and sport) have been recommended to address low levels of physical activity among children.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Whole-of-school approaches are also recommended within the WHO Global Action Plan for Physical Activity, as a way to promote enjoyment and participation in physical activity among youth.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>There are some examples of efficacious school-based approaches to promoting childrenâ€™s physical activity<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and reducing sedentary behaviour,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> although the association between implementation fidelity and intervention outcomes is unclear.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Most interventions target organised sport and physical education,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> yet interventions which provide sports and active equipment during recess, and incorporate playground markings can also successfully increase childrenâ€™s physical activity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> A systematic review has also shown that school interventions with a family element can be more effective at increasing physical activity than just focusing on the school setting alone<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>; however, few studies have determined the efficacy of strategies to reduce prolonged sitting both at school and home among children.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The initial <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> programme<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> was one of the earliest programmes (developed in 2009) to incorporate many of these elements with a particular focus on reducing and breaking up childrenâ€™s sitting throughout the school day.</p>
              <p>The efficacy of the initial <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> programme was demonstrated in a four-arm two-by-two factorial design cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 20 primary (elementary) schools, 226 teachers and over 1600 children in Melbourne, Australia (2010â€“2013).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The three intervention arms targeted either increases in physical activity (PA-I), reductions in sedentary behaviour (SB-I) or a combination of both (PA+SB-I), compared with a usual practice control. The results of this RCT are described and interpreted in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, in brief, at 18â€‰months (n=348), compared with usual practice, children who received the physical activity intervention (groups PA-I and PA+SB-I) had significantly less weekday sedentary time (âˆ’27â€‰min/day). Compared with usual practice, children who received the sedentary behaviour intervention (SB-I and PA+SB-I) spent more time in daily physical activity (5.5â€‰min/day) at 18â€‰months, and at 30â€‰months spent 33 min less in daily sedentary time, and specifically, 63 min less in sedentary time on weekdays, with no differences in physical activity at 30â€‰months.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Thus, strategies to promote both childrenâ€™s physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour were important. Results also showed beneficial effects on childrenâ€™s adiposity markers (body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (n=564)). However, there were mixed effects on childrenâ€™s blood pressure (BP), positive effects on systolic BP and negative effects on diastolic BP (n=537) and in a subsample of children (n=206), on blood parameters (eg, negative effects on some inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-2 and tumour necrosis factor-Î±, beneficial effects on vitamin D, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
              <p>Teachers, parents and children reported that the programme was positively received, and teachers involved in the intervention arms also reported perceptions of better classroom management and improved â€˜on-taskâ€™ behaviour during lessons.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Although barriers to implementation were experienced (including a lack of school leadership to support implementation long term, promotion and awareness raising, teacher time constraints and challenges with sustained integration into existing practices), overall, the programme was effectively integrated into the school curriculum.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Existing teaching practices, childrenâ€™s enjoyment and teacher awareness of programme values and benefits were the main facilitators of delivery and sustainability.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Following the success of <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic>, and exploration of adaptations for scaling (described in the Methods section), the Victorian Department of Education committed to partnering with the research team to support the dissemination and implementation of the programme to all primary (elementary) schools in Victoria, Australia. Given the small number of school-based interventions that are studied at scale<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and that use implementation theories to guide this process,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> scaling up of <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> presented a unique opportunity to investigate real-world implementation at scale. Assessment of intervention implementation among school-based interventions is greatly needed in the field.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
              <p>This paper describes the study protocol for a 5-year trial (launched September 2018â€“final data collection December 2023), which aims to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and implementation of <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> at scale. To note, the paper outlines the <italic toggle="yes">intended</italic> protocol for the trial (including planned dates and timelines for data collection), but also describes where and how this <italic toggle="yes">changed</italic> due to the impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In line with the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) framework criteria,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> we will evaluate the following five aims: the programmeâ€™s aim 1: <italic toggle="yes">Reach</italic> (proportion and representativeness of principals and teachers, parents and children participating in <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic>); aim 2: <italic toggle="yes">Effectiveness</italic> (change in childrenâ€™s daily physical activity and sedentary time 12 and 24â€‰months post-baseline); aim 3: <italic toggle="yes">Adoption</italic> (proportion and representativeness of schools choosing to implement <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic>); aim 4: <italic toggle="yes">Implementation</italic> (dissemination by education and health partners, uptake of intervention components, frequency, dose and adaptation to <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> delivery, and barriers and enablers to implementation); and aim 5: <italic toggle="yes">Individual-level Maintenance</italic> (change in childrenâ€™s physical activity and sedentary time 24â€‰months post-baseline) and <italic toggle="yes">Organisational-level Maintenance</italic> (institutionalisation and sustainability of the programme within the education and health systems, school settings and by teachers as part of routine practice).</p>

A quasi-experimental pre/post non-equivalent group design<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> with follow-up will be adopted. As this is a real-world roll-out in Victoria, a non-randomised two-group parallel arm approach was adopted.

                  <p>The <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> RCT showed that strategies to promote childrenâ€™s physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour were both important,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and therefore the combined (PA+SB-I) approach was the focus for wider scale-up. During the RCT, teacher professional development was delivered face-to-face by the research team, and schools received ongoing support from the team over the 2.5 years of the study. This approach was not considered feasible for scale-up. To facilitate scale-up, professional development, support and all programme materials and resources were converted into an online format to maximise potential reach at a lower cost. Formative evaluation with partners responsible for implementing interventions at scale can also be useful to inform adaptations to the intended dissemination strategy and refine the programme materials to enhance scalability.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Therefore, in close partnership with local councils (from Local Government Areas) and teachers, the <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> online materials were tested in two pilot dissemination trials and formative evaluation was conducted with key partner organisations involved in scale-up, detailed in the following section.</p>

                  <title><italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> pilot dissemination trials (2015â€“2017)</title>
                  <p>Two 12-month pilot dissemination trials were conducted during July 2015â€“2016 (pilot trial 1; n=4 schools, n=41 teachers) and 2017 (pilot trial 2; n=5 schools, 22 teachers), to assess the feasibility of <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> dissemination and the online teacher professional development. In both pilots, the programme was advertised to schools via two councils (representing two different Local Government Areas) in Victoria. The costs of programme equipment (eg, standing easels, sports equipment) and installation of playground line markings (eg, hopscotch) were subsidised by the councils to support uptake. Schools located in a lower-income area were offered a greater subsidy than schools in a higher-income area (determined using the Schools in a Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA), methods consistent with the original RCT).<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> All teachers within participating pilot schools were asked to, preferably, complete the online professional development (lasting 30â€“45â€‰min) during a session on their school site that was facilitated by a representative from the relevant council. As this was to inform the real-world dissemination trial and to help understand the feasibility of online professional development, schools could also send a nominated teacher and adopt a train-the-trainer approach.</p>
                  <p>Teachers completed online surveys before and after the professional development session, 2â€‰months and 12â€‰months post-baseline (max n=51 teachers; pilot trial 1), and at 4â€‰months post-baseline (n=22 teachers; pilot trial 2). Most teachers reported that they: (1) gained new knowledge of ways to increase childrenâ€™s physical activity (88%) and reduce sedentary behaviour (90%) at school; (2) learnt new teaching methods (78%); (3) perceived the online training to be an appropriate delivery method (82%); and (4) gained the required knowledge (90%) and confidence (80%) to implement the programme. Teachers requested visual examples of programme implementation (ie, digital video clips), which they felt would strengthen teacher engagement and sustain delivery of the programme. Although the RCT focused on children in grades 3â€“5 (ages 8â€“11 years), in both pilot trials, participating schools planned a whole-of-school approach to implementation across all school year levels, foundation to grade 6 (ages 5â€“12 years). For scale-up, programme materials were modified to accommodate delivery across all year levels, covering a range of learning areas (eg, mathematics, English, science and humanities), and digital video clips were developed to demonstrate appropriate implementation.</p>

                  <title>Formative evaluation with key partner organisations (2016)</title>
                  <p>Through an integrated researchâ€“practice partnership approach, collaboration began with one government (Victorian State government Department of Education) and five non-governmental organisations (the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth), the Victorian Principals Association, Independent Schools Victoria, the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation Victoria (ACHPER), and Peak Phys Ed). These partners play various roles in the education and health systems including, for example, responsibility for delivery of education to children and young people in Victorian government and independent schools (eg, Department of Education), and coordinating and delivering teacher education professional development (eg, ACHPER and Peak Phys Ed). In collaboration, these partners will provide ongoing input into the state-wide dissemination strategy, ensuring that the programme aligns with other existing school-based health promotion initiatives in the state (eg, the Victorian Achievement Program, which aims to create healthier early childhood services, schools and workplaces; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.achievementprogram.health.vic.gov.au/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.achievementprogram.health.vic.gov.au/</ext-link>), and that all resources (eg, health lessons) are linked to the Victorian curriculum and each resource identifies the specific strand, substrand, content description and achievement standard. For example, <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> supports the development of student capabilities (eg, critical and creative thinking, personal and social capabilities), which are taught explicitly in and through the learning area resources. <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> also provides cross-curriculum opportunities for students to strengthen their literacy and numeracy general capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Our focus is on implementation <italic toggle="yes">quality</italic> as opposed to controlling rigorous programme fidelity that is essential in efficacy trials. In school-based intervention implementation, â€˜qualityâ€™ can include: (1) sufficient exposure (dose); (2) fidelity to the programme protocol; (3) implementation (engaging students through active participation); (4) adaptation (modifying the intervention to meet developmental and cultural needs); and (5) teachersâ€™ attitudes, understanding of the concepts/issues and prior experience.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> In <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic>, schools were encouraged to choose contextually relevant strategies for implementation at their school, rather than a prescriptive programme, to enhance quality and ensure programme adoption occurs in the most contextually relevant way to achieve health benefits. This approach is associated with increased effectiveness of real-world interventions and those more likely to produce sustainable results.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p>
                  <p>In the context of <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs,</italic> we will be creating an implementation infrastructure for schools via Department of Education endorsement, provision of sustainability resources (ie, template policy statements for schools to embed the programme), and active engagement with state education decision-makers and other non-government partner organisations. Implementation resources will also be provided to support and encourage school-level leadership to implement the programme, and provide recommendations to promote integration and sustainability (ie, <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> champion roles and responsibilities, a template policy document).</p>

Based on outcomes from the two pilot trials and formative work with our partner organisations and to maximise programme reach, all supporting programme materials, implementation and training resources are available online via a programme website. The website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://transformus.com.au/" ext-link-type="uri">https://transformus.com.au/</ext-link>) is managed by the research team at Deakin University. Teachers are required to complete the mandatory online professional development via the <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> website. The professional development provides strategies to integrate and sustain implementation of the programme in schools, and thus is essential to ensure minimum standards and knowledge are established prior to programme delivery. Based on evidence for the determinants of effective implementation by adopting individuals (users, ie, teachers),<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55 56</xref> the content of the professional development programme has been designed to address the following seven key areas: (1) support for implementation (teacher and school level); (2) skills required for implementation; (3) knowledge required for implementation; (4) self-efficacy to implement; (5) fit of the programme into existing practices; (6) relative advantage of the intervention over existing practices; and (7) perceived ownership of the programme (allowing for adaptation). For example, the professional development includes ways of embedding the programme in practice, such as development of a tailored implementation plan (ie, a checklist of activities teachers wish to undertake and how they plan to sustain delivery) and knowledge reflection (quizzes) to test learning.</p>
                <p>Multiple dissemination routes will be used to maximise programme uptake and sustainability (eg, via our partners, through sharing the web link, email lists, social media, teacher professional learning networks, and teacher professional development conferences and workshops). Interactions with stakeholders will include face-to-face or online meetings (eg, approximately two group meetings per year in addition to regular one-on-one meetings), and the provision of dissemination materials and communication packs to stakeholders, to enable them to promote <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> via their existing social media platforms and newsletters.</p>

The target recruitment of children for the effectiveness study is based on statistical power calculations of the minimum number of participants required to detect differences in mean average daily sedentary behaviour (primary outcome) at 12 months (primary time point) between children in control and intervention schools. In the efficacy trial, average daily sedentary time was 347â€‰min (SD=60) for the PA+SB intervention group and 371â€‰min (SD=80) for the control group at time 3 (18â€‰months post-baseline). Sample size calculations were conducted assuming a pre/post-design, adjusting for baseline, in accordance with a published formula.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Based on estimates from the original cluster-RCT, to account for the design effect, an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.03 for children within school clusters was used, with a conservative correlation of 0.015 assumed between two different pupils within a cluster at different time points and a correlation of 0.22 between the same pupils at different time points.

                  <p>At what stage in the research process were patients/the public first involved in the research and how?</p>
                  <p>Six organisations were formal partners prior to the project being funded. This included a state government Department of Education and independent schoolsâ€™ peak body, teacher professional development organisations, a principalsâ€™ association and a health promotion foundation. As this is an implementation/effectiveness trial designed to scale up a previously efficacious school-based intervention, we engaged closely with these partners in the adaptation of the programme for scale-up. After funding was secured, these partnerships will continue to be integral to the dissemination and evaluation of this project.</p>
                  <p>How were the research question(s) and outcome measures developed and informed by their priorities, experience and preferences?</p>
                  <p>The research question related to the effectiveness of implementing and scaling up an evidence-based school intervention on childrenâ€™s physical activity and sedentary behaviour is directly aligned with the policy priorities of the Victorian Department of Education. The Department of Education has <italic toggle="yes">Education State</italic> targets which aim to increase the percentage of children in Victoria meeting physical activity guidelines by 20% by 2025. This alignment was critical in securing partnership with the Department of Education in Victoria.</p>
                  <p>How were patients/the public involved in the design of this study?</p>
                  <p>As previously noted, from study inception and through the adaptation process for scale-up, we have had input from teachers, teacher professional development organisations (eg, ACHPER and Peak Phys Ed), as well as key stakeholders such as local councils.</p>
                  <p>How were they involved in the recruitment to and conduct of the study?</p>
                  <p>Stakeholder partners have actively disseminated the programme and assisted with the recruitment of schools and teachers for this study, and some partners have also assisted with implementation of the intervention.</p>
                  <p>Were they asked to assess the burden of the intervention and time required to participate in the research?</p>
                  <p>An economic evaluation was conducted in the previous RCT which assessed the burden and time required for teachers to implement the programme. Interviews with teachers during a pilot phase prior to the RCT also informed the number of standing lessons and active breaks per day was feasible for teachers to implement in terms of time requirements. We also pilot tested the feasibility of the programme in terms of fitting it into the curriculum with teachers. This evidence was critical for informing the design and adaptations for the current project. Formal partners on the trial were also asked to consider the time required for their involvement in the trial (including any potential burden), as part of the in-kind contributions they provided as a partner organisation.</p>
                  <p>How were (or will) they be involved in your plans to disseminate the study results to the participants and relevant wider patient communities (eg, by choosing what information/results to share, when and in what format)?</p>
                  <p>All stakeholder partners will play a role in dissemination of findings to teachers, schools and broader audience (eg, health promotion officers, sport and recreation industry, etc) via a range of communication platforms (eg, social media, websites, newsletters, email distribution lists) and teacher education professional learning events and opportunities (eg, seminars, professional learning sessions and conference presentations, keynote addresses, etc).</p>

However, teachers could register and complete the professional development without a school being registered or be included within a participating school but chose not to complete the professional development. Therefore, we will also compare the number of teachers completing the professional development (actual recipients) versus the total number of teachers in Victorian schools (potentially eligible for the professional development) as an additional measure of programme reach.

                  <title>Effectiveness and individual-level maintenance</title>
                  <p>The effectiveness trial outcome variables will be assessed at T1 (baseline) and T2 (12 months) using accelerometers (<xref rid="SP4 SP5" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental files 4 and 5</xref>). Primary outcomes include childrenâ€™s average minutes/day of MVPA and sedentary time. Secondary outcomes include childrenâ€™s average weekday MVPA and sedentary time (minutes/day), average minutes/day of MVPA and sedentary during school hours, BMI z-scores (zBMI) and waist circumference. Individual-level maintenance will be assessed at T3 (24 months). Individual-level maintenance is defined as continued benefits among recipients (ie, sustained increases in MVPA or decreases in sedentary time).</p>
                  <p>Grades 3 and 4 childrenâ€™s MVPA and sedentary time will be assessed using hip-mounted ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers (Pensacola, Florida, USA) during waking hours for 8 consecutive days (excluding water-based activities). To capture the sporadic nature of childrenâ€™s physical activity, data will be collected in 5-second epochs, and will be processed using Evenson cut-off points.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Non-wear time is defined as â‰¥20â€‰min of consecutive zeros<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> and a cut-off point of 100 counts/min will be used to indicate sedentary time in children. Primary and secondary outcomes will be computed using only data from days on which a minimum of 8â€‰hours of wear time on weekdays and 7â€‰hours of wear time on weekend days were recorded (valid days). A minimum of 4 valid days (either weekday or weekend) will be required for inclusion in analysis. Inclusion criteria for school days will be accelerometer data for at least 50% of school hours.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63 64</xref></p>
                  <p>Childrenâ€™s height (cm) and waist circumference (cm), and weight (kg) will be assessed twice (to the nearest 0.1â€‰cm and 0.1â€‰kg, respectively) in school at each time point by trained research assistants. If the difference between the two measurements is greater than the following thresholds (height=0.5â€‰cm; waist=1â€‰cm; weight=0.2â€‰kg), a third measurement will be taken. An average of the two closest measurements will then be calculated for analyses. Height will be assessed using a portable stadiometer (SECA 220, Los Angeles, California, USA). Weight will be assessed using digital scales (Wedderburn Tanita, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), and a flexible steel tape will assess waist circumference at the narrowest point between the bottom rib and the iliac crest, in the midaxillary plane. BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) z-scores will be calculated by subtracting the sexâ€“age population median BMI scores from childrenâ€™s raw BMI scores.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></p>
                  <p>Additional exploratory outcomes will include childrenâ€™s awareness of the programme and self-reported quality of life,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> assessed via an online survey at T1 (baseline), T2 (12â€‰months) and T3 (24â€‰months). The EQ-5D-Y-3L questionnaire<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> for children and adolescents aged 8â€“16 years is an internationally validated Englishâ€“Australian version of the EQ-5D questionnaire developed by the EuroQol Research Foundation. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) section contains five items that capture (on a 3-point scale) mobility, independence, usual activity, pain and feelings, and a sixth item that captures the childâ€™s perceived overall health rating (sliding scale 0â€“100) on the day of survey completion. Following EQ-5D-Y-3L scoring protocols, an overall HRQoL score will be created.</p>
                  <p>Parents will provide via an online survey a proxy report of their childâ€™s physical activity using a validated single-item measure assessing compliance with Australian physical activity guidelines.<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></p>

                  <title>Adaptations to data collection due to COVID-19 restrictions</title>
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on data collection resulting in a need to change our protocol (<xref rid="SP4 SP5" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental files 4 and 5</xref>). Due to extended COVID-19 lockdowns and government restrictions in Australia, on-site data collection in schools was prohibited in Victoria during 2020 and 2021 and in NSW during 2021. During periods when children were able to attend school over that time, accelerometers were sent directly to families or directly to schools for distributing to students (NSW only), and the child and parent surveys were completed online. Height, weight and waist circumference data were not collected. Teacher and principal data (survey and interview) were also not collected to reduce burden on school staff during the challenges of teaching remotely. These adaptations impacted 6 schools at T2, and 20 schools at T3 in Victoria and 2 schools at T3 in NSW. Due to differences in lockdown restrictions between the states in 2020, the timing of data collection in NSW was adjusted to match Victoria. As a result, principal/teachersâ€™ interviews were only conducted at 12â€‰months.</p>
                  <p>As primary schools in Victoria were unable to operate as normal and ran learning from home for a total of 267 days across 2020 and 2021, additional teacher support was provided so they could apply the pedagogical elements of <italic toggle="yes">TransformUs</italic> to online teaching and learning. This included a remote learning sample pack with active English and Math lesson ideas that could be delivered online. An online family pack was also provided for parents to help support their childâ€™s physical activity at home.</p>

                    <p>The effectiveness component of the study will compare primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes among children, between intervention and control schools. Linear mixed models will be fitted to compare mean average daily sedentary time and MVPA at T1 (baseline), T2 (12 months) and T3 (24 months) (primary outcomes), average sedentary time and MVPA on weekdays and during school hours, zBMI, waist circumference (secondary outcomes) and quality of life (exploratory outcomes) at 12â€‰months and 24â€‰months between children in intervention and control schools. Linear mixed models will include fixed effects for group (intervention/control), time (months since baseline (time 1)) and a group by time interaction, and random effects for clustering of time nested within children, class and school. In the absence of random assignment, propensity scores will be developed to determine the probability of a child receiving the intervention based on observed baseline covariates (eg, age, sex, area-level SES of residence). Inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score will be adopted to assist in obtaining unbiased estimates of average treatment effects, although it is acknowledged that this will not control for the difference in location (Victoria or NSW) between intervention and control schools.<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> Due to the impact of COVID-19 interruptions on this study, sensitivity analysis will consider only children who participated in baseline and 12-month follow-up in intervention and control schools to examine the effectiveness prior to home schooling and other COVID-19 impacts.</p>
