                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The effectiveness of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, which are the main stay of managing anaemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is largely dependent on adequate body iron stores. The iron stores are determined by the levels of serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation. These two surrogate markers of iron stores are used to guide iron replacement therapy. Most Aboriginal and/or Torres Islander Australians of the Northern Territory (herein respectfully referred to as First Nations Australians) with end-stage kidney disease have ferritin levels higher than current guideline recommendations for iron therapy. There is no clear evidence to guide safe and effective treatment with iron in these patients. We aim to assess the impact of intravenous iron treatment on all-cause death and hospitalisation with a principal diagnosis of all-cause infection in First Nations patients on haemodialysis with anaemia, high ferritin levels and low transferrin saturation</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In a prospective open-label blinded endpoint randomised controlled trial, a total of 576 participants on maintenance haemodialysis with high ferritin (&gt; 700 μg/L and ≤ 2000 μg/L) and low transferrin saturation (&lt; 40%) from all the 7 renal units across the Northern Territory of Australia will be randomised 1:1 to receive intravenous iron polymaltose 400 mg once monthly (200 mg during 2 consecutive haemodialysis sessions) (Arm A) or no IV iron treatment (standard treatment) (Arm B). Rescue therapy will be administered when the ferritin levels fall below 700 μg/L or when clinically indicated. The primary outcome will be the differences between the two study arms in the risk of hospitalisation with all-cause infection or death. An economic analysis and several secondary and tertiary outcomes analyses will also be performed.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The INFERR clinical trial will address significant uncertainty on the safety and efficacy of iron therapy in First Nations Australians with CKD with hyperferritinaemia and evidence of iron deficiency. This will hopefully lead to the development of evidence-based guidelines. It will also provide the opportunity to explore the causes of hyperferritinaemia in First Nations Australians from the Northern Territory.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and Rationale{6a}</title>
                <p id="Par65">Rates of dialysis-requiring end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians (herein respectfully referred to as First Nations Australians) of the Northern Territory (NT) are some of the highest in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Anaemia is a major complication of ESKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Prevalence rates of anaemia are also high among First Nations Australians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Anaemia is associated with reduced quality of life, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hospitalisations, cognitive impairment, and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is the main approach for correcting anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and work most effectively when the patient is replete in iron stores. The appropriate use of ESAs improves quality of life and reduces morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. One of the major causes of anaemia in people with CKD is iron deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Iron deficiency is also the commonest cause of poor response to ESA therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par66">The effective treatment of anaemia in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients therefore requires both the accurate assessment of iron status, and the safe and appropriate correction of iron deficiency. Several published guidelines are available to guide iron replacement in patients with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Iron therapy using these guidelines is largely dependent on the levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) [the ratio of serum iron to the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) as a percentage], both surrogate markers of iron status. Ferritin is an intracellular protein which stores excess iron, and low serum ferritin is a marker of iron deficiency. However, ferritin is also an acute phase protein, and increased serum ferritin concentration, along with increases in other acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP), is observed in patients who have inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is also growing evidence that high serum ferritin concentration is independently associated with high rates of hospitalisations, cardiovascular disease and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par67">True iron deficiency is indicated by the co-occurrence of both low ferritin and low TSAT levels. Functional iron deficiency is characterised by an impaired iron release from body stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is thought to be due to reticuloendothelial cell iron blockade; serum ferritin is normal or high and serum TSAT levels are low. In patients with CKD, both true iron deficiency and functional iron deficiency need treatment with iron replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In First Nations Australians in the NT, anaemia in MHD patients co-exists with ESA-hyporesponsiveness, high serum ferritin concentrations and high serum CRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in a population with heavy burden of cardiovascular, infectious diseases, hospitalisations and premature mortality. High serum ferritin levels have been recognised in this population for almost 20 years, and since these levels may be due to chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], there is significant uncertainty regarding the appropriate management of anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] using serum ferritin levels as a marker of iron status. The recently replaced NT iron management protocol was developed to guide iron replacement in MHD patients with serum ferritin levels above 500μg/L associated with low TSAT (<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Evidence to guide safe and effective use of intravenous iron in this population is urgently required.</p>
                <p id="Par68">In a study of the effectiveness of this protocol in correcting iron deficiency in 197 NT patients on MHD, we found patients were poorly responsive to ESA treatment and received higher annual doses of iron treatment both in absolute terms and relative to the haemoglobin response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In another cohort, high ferritin levels in First Nations MHD patients were only partly explained by iron sufficiency as indicated by high TSAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The retrospective design of these 2 studies meant that the possible presence of iron overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which is a clear risk in this situation, could not be determined. Despite this, the higher iron doses observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] suggest iron overload is a potential harm. We thus identified the need for a prospective study to investigate the safe and effective administration of iron among First Nations patients on MHD with high ferritin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par69">Findings of studies that we conducted in the NT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and evidence from other international studies demonstrate a need to use serum ferritin levels and TSAT in conjunction with other markers of iron status, particularly in patients with a high serum ferritin concentration. A report from the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has discouraged the use of either measure alone due to significant problems with lack of accuracy in determining the correct treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Other potential markers of iron status include hepcidin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], soluble transferrin receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (shown to be a better marker of iron stores than ferritin in First Nations children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], low mean corpuscle volume (MCV) and hypochromic, microcytic RBCs on blood film, percentage hypochromic red cells (PHRC) and reticulocyte haemoglobin content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par70">One potential and unexplored cause of high ferritin is the association with the metabolic syndrome in our patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Metabolic syndrome and diabetes are highly prevalent conditions among First Nations ESKD patients, but the association with raised ferritin has not been investigated. Examining the association of ferritin with more specific inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) will help to confirm if the ferritin is due to causes other than inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par71">A recent study showed that serum ferritin (200–500 μg/L) correctly reflected liver iron stores, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (FerriScan®), in haemodialysis patients without overt inflammation or malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The authors concluded that current ferritin target values should be lowered to avoid iron overload. However, ferritin levels in their patients were much lower than in our First Nations MHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Another study has the opposite conclusion that transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels were poor markers of liver and cardiac iron deposition in MHD subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In patients with high ferritin levels receiving iron treatment, it is crucial to monitor iron overload by measuring liver iron non-invasively with MRI-FerriScan® [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Monitoring liver fibrosis (using FibroScan®) and cirrhosis is also crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Considering the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome in the First Nations Australian population, it may be hypothesised that a high prevalence of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis exists as encountered in dialysis patients more and more frequently in developed countries as well as the dysmetabolic iron overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is a need to identify those patients with these underlying liver diseases, to adapt iron dosage and to monitor the safety of IV iron in this setting. This peculiar safety issue seems particularly relevant since indiscriminate IV iron has recently been shown to either trigger or aggravate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease / non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in dialysis patients suggesting a double-edged iron sword [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par72">In some studies, iron treatment has been associated with adverse effects (infections, cardiovascular complications and hospitalisations) especially if doses of &gt; 1000 mg are given over 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Our patients are already at high risk of infections such as high rates of melioidosis during the wet season and high prevalence cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par73">Current evidence of treatment in patients with high serum ferritin levels is from two North America clinical trials. The Dialysis Patients’ Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) study showed that administration of ferric gluconate (125 mg for eight treatments) was superior to no iron therapy in anaemic dialysis patients receiving adequate ESA dosages with a ferritin 500 to 1200 ng/ml and TSAT ≤ 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

The research team explains the rationale and methodology of the study face to face to potential study participants from the dialysis patients and their families and carers. Patients and their families and carers are given the opportunity to ask questions and consider whether to participate in the trial. An informed consent discussion is held with each participant. The information for the discussion is provided in written and oral formats that have been approved by the Human Research Committees (HRECs) and in a language comprehensible to the potential participant, using interpreters where indicated.</p>
                <p id="Par86">The information presented details the exact nature of the trial and what is expected of the participant including any risks or benefits in taking part. It is clearly stated that the participant is free to withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal. The participants are allowed ample time to go through the Participant Information Sheet and ask questions.</p>
                <p id="Par87">The participant personally signs and dates the latest approved version of the consent form, as will the investigator or the delegated study team member (who conducted the consent discussion).

A witness must be present during the entire consenting process and must be able and willing to sign the consent form also. A copy of the Participant Information Sheet and consent form is provided to the participant. No trial-related procedure is undertaken before documented informed consent is obtained. The original copy of the consent form is retained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) at the recruitment site and a copy placed in the patient’s medical records. The person conducting the consent discussion will document this in the participant’s medical record and enter data into the Day 1 Case Report Form (CRF)</p>

The 2-year rate of admission with first episode of infection or death in our patients on maintenance haemodialysis from 2000 to 2014 was 60%. In order to achieve a study power &gt; 80% at 5% significance level in detecting a 30% reduction (from 60 to 48%) in the rate of first hospitalisation with all-cause infection or death, using the log-rank test (time-to-event modelling) assuming a 5% drop-out rate, 576 participants will be randomised 1:1 into each arm. The study also has &gt; 90% power at 5% significance level of detecting a difference in haemoglobin of 5 g/L and standard deviation of 11.3 g/L based on published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

                  <p id="Par142">All patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis in renal units across the Northern Territory undergo a series of clinical laboratory tests (haematology and serum chemistry) at the commencement of the month as part of routine care. These results are used to screen potential participants for eligibility into the study.</p>
                  <p id="Par143">The treating renal team is approached for a discussion on potential recruitment of the patients into the trial, and for permission to review the patient’s medical notes. The study team assesses the eligibility criteria and completes the Pre-Screening Case Report Form (CRF). If ineligible, the patient is not approached. If considered eligible, the patient is approached for an informed consent discussion using the teach back method to determine if an interpreter is required to obtain consent. After consent is obtained, eligibility will be re-established prior to randomisation. Each unit maintains a log of all pre-screened patients along with their eligibility and consent outcomes in the medical records or notes. However, should a potential participant consent meet the temporary exclusion criteria at time of screening they will be re-approached for inclusion into the trial at a subsequent clinic visit.</p>
                  <p id="Par144">To maximise recruitment, the research team spends a considerable time in the renal units providing information and education to potential participants using the teach back method. There is also a potential for expanding the recruitment to other renal units across Northern Australia to achieve the desired sample size.</p>

Independent outcomes Assessors not involved in any aspect of the study will review and complete a data collection form of all randomised study participants to independently determine the study outcomes (from both electronic and written medical records). In view of the relationships likely to develop between the research staff and some of the participants, it is essential that we engage independent outcomes assessors.

The purpose of this contact is to check compliance with the protocol in terms of study drug prescribing and ordering of routine clinical blood tests. Data is collected and entered into the corresponding visit CRF. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will contain step by step details on how to recruit patients, collect data and monitor progress.</p>
                <p id="Par168">Participants have the right to choose to withdraw from the study at any time and the investigator may discontinue a participant from the study or from treatment if deemed appropriate at any time. This will have no impact on their normal dialysis and other treatment or care. Reasons why a participant may be withdrawn from the study include, but are not limited to, participant request, primary treating clinician’s request, participant was enrolled and is ineligible (either arising during the study or was overlooked at time of screening and enrolment). Participants will not be withdrawn due to adverse events. The decision to withdraw a participant from the study must be discussed with the coordinating investigators.</p>
                <p id="Par169">If the participant withdraws consent from participating in the study and also withdraws consent for collection of future information, no further evaluations will be performed, and no additional data will be collected. The sponsors may retain and continue to use any data or samples collected before such withdrawal of consent. Participants that are lost to follow-up will continue to be followed by collecting as much data as possible, if possible, until the end of the trial to avoid missing data. Participants withdrawn from the treatment by the treating clinicians will continue to be followed up to the end of the trial to avoid missing data and will be used in the intention-to-treat analysis. This study has allowed for 5% of participant drop-out. Withdrawn participants will not be replaced.</p>

                <title>Data management {19}</title>
                <p id="Par171">Source documents are those where data are first recorded, and from which participants’ CRF data are obtained. These include but are not limited to hospital records both electronic and paper (which will include medical history, previous and current medications, any relevant radiography test, blood test results, haemodynamic parameters, and medical correspondence) and paper or electronic clinic records (which include vital status, recent medical history and relevant blood culture results). A further potential data source will be through telephone conversations with the study participant or their primary doctor or general practitioner.</p>
                <p id="Par172">Storage and archiving of study documents (CRFs and consent forms) are the responsibility of the site principal investigator and these will remain at the site of recruitment.</p>
                <p id="Par173">Data for this study is recorded via a secure, Electronic Data Capture (EDC) web-based system (REDCap). It is transcribed by the study team from the paper CRFs into REDCap. Data is stored in a re-identifiable manner in the database, using the unique screening number for each patient. The database contains validation ranges for each variable to minimise the chance of data entry errors. An audit trail will maintain a record of initial entries and changes made; reasons for change; time and date of entry; and username of the person who made the change. Data queries are raised by the Clinical Trial Manager and study monitor, and missing data or suspected errors are raised as data queries and resolved prior to database lock and analysis. The database contains in-line capability so that these queries and answers are logged as part of the audit trail.</p>
                <p id="Par174">For each potential participant screened (including screen failures), the screening eCRF is completed by the study team. For each participant enrolled, eCRFs must be completed. This also applies to records for those patients who fail to complete the study. The study team should ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data reported in the eCRFs and in all required reports. A comprehensive validation check programme verifies the data and automatically generates discrepancies for resolution by the study team. Manual discrepancies can also be raised if necessary.</p>
                <p id="Par175">In addition, for selected data fields, accurate and reliable data collection is assured by verification of the eCRFs against the study team’s records by the study monitor (source document verification), and the maintenance of medication compliance is captured in the CRFs from the participant’s medication chart (source document) by the study team.</p>

                <p id="Par176">REDCap is 21 CRF Part 11 capable. Currently, REDCap installations support electronic signatures by positively identifying the user through a unique username and password combination. All study participants are allocated a unique number at time of screening (screening number or study ID number), and this screening number is added to all the CRFs for that participant. The participants also have their hospital record number (HRN) recorded on the CRFs as this information is required to ensure the correct medical record is accessed during medical record reviews.</p>
                <p id="Par177">Access to the REDCap database will be given to the study personnel only, including the biostatistician and data management personnel. Data being analysed will be exported in de-identified format. As part of the data dictionary development process, individual fields are denoted as “identifiers.” When exporting a de-identified dataset, these variables are omitted. Identities of participants will not be revealed in the presentation or publication of any result from this study. All study personnel are educated about the importance of strictly protecting participants’ rights to confidentiality and can only access the data necessary for job completion. Participants will be informed of law-mandated instances in which confidentially could be breached.</p>
                <p id="Par178">The trial management committee will be the custodians of the final trial dataset. No-one outside the trial management committee will be given access to the data without the permission of the trial management committee. No identifying data will be given to any third parties at any stage. Following study close out and locking of the database, it will be stored on the servers of the Menzies School of Health Research.</p>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par230"><italic>Unrelated</italic>: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an aetiology other than the study drugs. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (e.g. pre-existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness or concomitant medication).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par231"><italic>Related</italic>: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drugs. It should be emphasised that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of adverse event reporting.</p></list-item></list></p>
                    <p id="Par232">The degree of certainty with which an adverse event is attributable to treatment, or an alternative cause will be determined by how well the event can be understood in terms of:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par233">Temporal relationship with the administration of the treatment or cessation of treatment</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par234">Reactions of a similar nature previously observed in the individual or others following treatment.</p></list-item></list></p>
                    <p id="Par235">The relationship of the adverse event to treatment will be specified as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par236"><italic>Not related</italic>In the PI’s opinion, there is not a causal relationship.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par237"><italic>Unlikely</italic>The temporal association between treatment and the adverse event is such that treatment is not likely to have any reasonable association.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par238"><italic>Possibly</italic>The adverse event could have been caused by treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par239"><italic>Probably</italic>The adverse event follows a temporal sequence from the time of treatment and cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the participant’s clinical presentation/history.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par240"><italic>Definitely</italic>The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of treatment or reappears when the treatment is repeated.</p></list-item></list></p>

Reporting to the HREC will be in accordance with local guidelines. If it is an expected side effect (i.e. one listed in the product information, such as allergic reaction or diarrhoea), it does not need to be reported to the TGA. If it is both <italic>unexpected</italic> and serious, it needs to be reported to the TGA within 7 days (fatal or life threatening) or 15 days (other).</p>

The monitor must verify that the participant received the study drug as randomised. The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports and other participant records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF. The investigators and site staff and teams agree to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved in a timely manner.</p>

A safety measure was written into the protocol to avoid putting participants at risk of either excessive or insufficient IV iron administration according to the current standards for haemodialysis patients. Prior to receiving any study treatment, participants’ blood results are reviewed for ferritin and TSAT levels; participants’ treatment varies based on the results of these blood levels:

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par257">The INFERR clinical trial will address significant uncertainty on the safety and efficacy of iron therapy in First Nations Australians with ESKD with hyperferritinaemia and evidence of iron deficiency. This will hopefully lead to the development of evidence-based guidelines. It will also provide the opportunity to explore the causes of hyperferritinaemia. Anaemia, and particularly, iron deficiency anaemia, is common among First Nations ESKD patients from the NT. The coexistence of hyperferritinaemia, inflammation and chronic infections complicates the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in First Nations patients with CKD/ESKD which the trial will address [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par258">The study will also evaluate the significant issues on the performance differences in ferritin measurement platforms to determine clinical decision limits in people with CKD/ESKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Identifying and evaluating patients with hepatic diseases such as hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as seen in high prevalent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome states, dialysis dependence and dysmetabolic iron overload will help to adapt iron dosage and to monitor the safety of IV iron therapy in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par259">Indiscriminate IV iron therapy has recently been shown to either trigger or aggravate NAFLD in dialysis patients which warrants the evaluation in the INFERR clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par260">The use of FerriScans, recently shown to accurately measure hepatic iron load in dialysis patients will provide useful information for decision, choice and follow-up of iron therapy in patients with hyperferritinaemia and evidence or iron deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par271">The study protocol, patient information sheet, participant consent forms, and any other documents or media required for ethics approval were submitted to the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees for approval before the study commenced. Each HREC reviewing the protocol was properly constituted as per regulatory requirements (according to NHMRC requirements) and had the capacity to review the study. Approvals specified the study title and version numbers, identified all documents reviewed and stated the date of review. No amendments to, or deviations from, the protocol will be initiated without prior written approval from the relevant HREC. The exceptions to this are:
