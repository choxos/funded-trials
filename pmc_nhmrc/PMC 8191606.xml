                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>There is growing interest in assessing the impact of health interventions, particularly when women are the focus of the intervention, on women’s empowerment. Globally, research has shown that interventions targeting nutrition, health and economic development can affect women’s empowerment. Evidence suggests that women’s empowerment is also an underlying determinant of nutrition outcomes. Depending on the focus of the intervention, different domains of women’s empowerment will be influenced, for example, an increase in nutritional knowledge, or greater control over income and access to resources.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>This study evaluates the impact of the Shonjibon Cash and Counselling (SCC) Trial that combines nutrition counselling and an unconditional cash transfer, delivered on a mobile platform, on women’s empowerment in rural Bangladesh.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will use a mixed-methods approach, combining statistical analysis of quantitative data from 2840 women in a cluster randomised controlled trial examining the impact of nutrition behaviour change communications (BCCs) and cash transfers on child undernutrition. Pregnant participants will be given a smartphone with a customised app, delivering nutrition BCC messages, and will receive nutrition counselling via a call centre and an unconditional cash transfer. This study is a component of the SCC Trial and will measure women’s empowerment using a composite indicator based on the Project-Level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index, with quantitative data collection at baseline and endline. Thematic analysis of qualitative data, collected through longitudinal interviews with women, husbands and mothers-in-law, will elicit a local understanding of women’s empowerment and the linkages between the intervention and women’s empowerment outcomes. This paper describes the study protocol to evaluate women’s empowerment in a nutrition-specific and sensitive intervention using internationally validated, innovative tools and will help fill the evidence gap on pathways of impact, highlighting areas to target for future programming.</p>

Findings from this study will be shared in Bangladesh with dissemination sessions in-country and internationally at conferences, and will be published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>To define women’s empowerment is not straightforward, nor is it easy to measure across the different domains and phases of a woman’s life. Empowerment is ‘the process of enhancing an individual’s or group’s capacity to make purposive choices and to transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes’.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The United Nations defines women’s empowerment as having five key components: ‘women’s sense of self-worth; their right to have and to determine choices; their right to have access to opportunities and resources; their right to have the power to control their own lives, both within and outside the home; and their ability to influence the direction of social change to create a more just social and economic order, nationally and internationally’.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>Gender, socially constructed roles assigned by sex, is one of the keynote determinants of health outcomes,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> making gender equality and the rights of women an imperative goal in global public health. Gender inequality and restrictive gender norms are, according to the Lancet 2019 series on Gender Equality, Norms and Health, ‘powerful but separate determinants of health and well-being’.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 aims to achieve gender equality and to empower all women and girls, ending discrimination in all forms, from violence to forced marriage, and experience full active participation and equal rights in all spheres of life—politically, economically and socially.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Out of the 17 SDGs, 11 entail indicators related to gender.</p>
              <p>Much progress has been made towards gender equality and the empowerment of women globally. Yet, the potential for women to fully participate as ‘agents of change’ is still limited due to persistent social, economic and political inequalities.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Women continue to be constrained by norms, beliefs and customs through which societies differentiate between women and men.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Contextual forms of oppression include patriarchal societies and institutions, as well as lack of opportunity due to socioeconomic circumstances such as poverty. Violence, including intimate partner violence (IPV), disproportionally affects women. Worldwide, a third of women report experience physical or sexual IPV.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Women subjected to IPV suffer poor mental and physical health, and their children show poorer health, nutrition and development outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Evidence suggests that the combination of cash transfers and behaviour change communication (BCC) can increase women’s bargaining power and poverty-related emotional well-being and can lead to a reduction in IPV.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Interventions to improve the health and nutrition literacy of women and, in particular, counselling through mobile phone applications can make a positive impact on women’s empowerment. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have the potential to improve a woman’s confidence and decision-making skills in communicating with healthcare professionals. However, a systematic review revealed the need for a further rigorous investigation into mHealth, in terms of implementation and evaluation, to establish whether mHealth programmes transform rather than reinforce gender inequalities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> When a woman receives additional resources, such as cash transfers, and is the target of an mHealth programme, this can challenge gender norms within relationships and exacerbate gender disparities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There is limited evidence on the adverse effects of mHealth, such as expanding the digital divide and gender-based power imbalances, and this lack of evidence emphasises the need to monitor the impact of mHealth interventions on gender relations and women’s empowerment.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>The Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Nutrition also advocates the use of cash transfers and social safety net programmes, which are increasingly the preferred approach to support households living in chronic and extreme poverty.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> When targeted at women, social protection can promote women’s economic empowerment and enhance decision-making ability, with the overarching assumption that control over cash will lead to greater investment in children’s health and education.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> When women are engaged in nutrition-sensitive programmes that use social safety nets, certain aspects of women’s empowerment are augmented, such as changes in gender roles and intrahousehold bargaining power.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>We plan to conduct a study, embedded in a cluster randomised control trial (RCT) that assesses a multifaceted nutrition intervention that aims to reduce childhood stunting—the Shonjibon Cash and Counselling (SCC) Trial.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This protocol paper presents the way we will measure the impact of the SCC Trial on women’s empowerment.</p>

                <title>Developmental interventions and women’s empowerment in Bangladesh</title>
                <p>Although Bangladesh has made remarkable reductions in rates of poverty, almost one in four of the population still live in poverty (24.3% in 2016).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In 2018, the agriculture sector accounted for 40% of total employment.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In most low-income countries, women account for almost half of the agricultural labour force; however, in Bangladesh, women exceed 50% of the agricultural labour force.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In rural Bangladesh, social constructs such as gender roles of women and men powerfully drive household food consumption.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A nationally representative sample from Bangladesh found that women’s empowerment increases dietary diversity and availability of calories at a household level.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> The Government of Bangladesh and development organisations have shown a keen interest in combining nutrition counselling and cash transfers to improve maternal and child nutrition.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
                <p>In rural Bangladesh, 84% of households have access to a mobile phone.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A study in Bangladesh revealed women using Aponjon, a mobile messaging-based service providing information about mother and babies, had higher rates of autonomy in accessing mobile phones, although two-thirds of the women resided in urban areas. mHealth consultations may help address sociocultural gender norms and empower women as they were able to discuss personal health issues on the phone with female doctors who are infrequently found in rural communities.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The need to collect sex-aggregated, valid, comprehensive and standardised empowerment data is therefore imperative not only to achieve SDG 5 but also to enable the consistent measurement of women’s empowerment indices.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref></p>

                <title>Objectives and hypotheses</title>
                <p>This study evaluates the impact of a combined nutrition counselling and an unconditional cash transfer RCT (SCC Trial), delivered on a mobile platform, on the level of empowerment of women in rural Bangladesh. This study will assess women’s experience of empowerment and disempowerment throughout the SCC trial.</p>
                <p>The primary hypothesis is that in a community-based cluster RCT of a mobile phone-based nutrition BCC and unconditional cash transfer given to women in low-income families in rural Bangladesh, women’s empowerment will increase as measured by an increase in mean women’s empowerment scores (by an average percentage of 20) from the baseline to the end of the 24-month intervention, compared with women in the control arm.</p>
                <p>The secondary hypotheses are that the mobile phone nutrition BCC and unconditional cash transfer compared to usual programmes will (1) increase control over income and economic resources, (2) improve input and decision-making power in nutrition and health care choices, and (3) decrease the acceptance and experience of IPV.</p>

                <title>SCC Trial: women’s empowerment theory of change</title>
                <p>Empowering women is not an explicit goal of the SCC Trial; however, women gain access to nutrition counselling, cash transfers and a mobile phone; the use of these resources can empower women. We constructed the theory of change to illustrate how the SCC Trial will impact on women’s empowerment outcomes. It outlines the barriers, intervention details, intermediate outcomes, outcomes and impact pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                </fig>
                <p>The SCC Trial intervention is delivered on a mobile platform. Women receive an mHealth interactive app—messages, audio and video, quizzes—as well as gestational age specific counselling from the call centre. They also receive cash via BKash mobile banking app. The principal rationale of the theory of change causal pathway to impact is that the SCC Trial will lead to an increase in women’s empowerment for those women participating in the intervention arm.</p>
                <p>The Project-Level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (Pro-WEAI)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> indicators, discussed in detail later, appear in the theory of change across the outcomes. We will use the six indicators from the Pro-WEAI to calculate the women’s empowerment index and include (1) control over use of income, (2) input into productive decisions, (3) autonomy in income, (4) decision-making power on nutrition and healthcare, (5) respect among household members and (6) attitudes towards IPV.</p>
                <p>One of the barriers to nutrition faced in rural Bangladesh is limited access to nutrition and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) information. Women in the SCC Trial intervention arm receive nutrition, IYCF and livelihood BCC delivered on a mobile app and nutrition counselling from the call centre. The intermediate outcome is woman’s acquisition of new BCC/nutrition knowledge, contributing to increased input into and decision-making power about health and nutrition choices for herself and her family (indicator 4). Improvements in communication also occur (spousal, intrahousehold and community) as new knowledge is discussed and shared, including ways to put the messages into action (indicator 5). One’s ability to make decisions is a measure of empowerment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> New knowledge can be used as leverage and bargaining power and enhance decision-making abilities across a range of areas such as livelihoods, household expenditure and decisions on productive assets, that is, what crops to farm (indicators 2–4).</p>
                <p>The SCC Trial setting is in one of the poorest regions in Bangladesh. Families face barriers such as food insecurity and lack of financial resources. When a woman is the recipient of a cash transfer, the intermediate outcome is increased control over the use of income (indicator 1). Cash transfers, targeted at women, have the potential to improve livelihoods, alleviate poverty, enhance food security and increase women’s empowerment.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Spousal communication is also strengthened as discussion ensues as to how to spend the additional income (indicator 4). The outcomes for women receiving an unconditional cash transfer include a strengthened ability to contribute to and participate in financial decision making. This decision making covers health and nutrition choices, household expenditure, productive assets, livelihood choices (ie, homestead gardening, buying chickens to raise for eggs, meat and income; indicators 1–4).</p>
                <p>IPV includes behaviour that is physical, psychological, sexual, or abusive or controlling in nature.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> There is evidence that the combination of additional income from cash transfers combined with BCC can increase women’s bargaining power and poverty-related emotional well-being.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Changing attitudes, from within the family unit, as women participate and learn from intervention activities, has the potential to lead to a change in the acceptability of IPV, linked to a woman’s right to bodily integrity.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Women may also experience an increase in respect and self-efficacy and subsequent reduction in acceptance of IPV (indicator 6).</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>We will embed this study on women’s empowerment within the SCC Trial. The SCC Trial will recruit pregnant women and follow-up over 24 months of an expected 2840 mother–child dyad, from recruitment in early pregnancy until the child is 18 months of age. The intervention will run for 36 months, depending on the time of enrolment and gestation, and the age of the child.</p>

                <p>Our study site has over 1100 villages, which would be adequate to cover the anticipated sample size. Each cluster encompasses two to four villages and consists of ~1000 households and ~4500 population. We will use a fixed randomisation scheme to assign treatments to eligible clusters, with a uniform allocation ratio of treatments, stratified by union. The sample size will consist of 104 clusters, total women (n=2840) allocated to two parallel groups (n=1420) with 20 mother–infant dyads per cluster. Each cluster consists of one to four adjacent villages with a minimum population of 600 households per cluster with 454 villages in our study area for clustering. A subsample of the households from a purposively selected subset of clusters will be chosen for qualitative data.</p>
                <p>The intervention and control groups will receive similar maternal and child health and nutrition services from the government, and the critical difference will be the nutrition BCCs with cash transfers on a mobile platform received by women in the intervention arm. The study design will control for potential observed and unobserved confounding factors as there will be an adequate number of clusters randomly allocated to the treatment groups. The geographical separation of clusters will limit the contamination of the intervention arm. We will use STATA V17 software to generate the random allocation sequence. We are unable to mask the treatment arm due to the nature of the intervention.</p>

                <p>The sample size for our trial is fixed by the primary hypothesis in the main SCC Trial, which estimated a total sample of 2184 mother–infant pairs from 104 clusters.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> We can find no reports of intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the women’s empowerment indicators we plan to use. Therefore, we estimate that the fixed trial sample size will provide at least 80% power to detect a 20% increase in women’s empowerment, assuming 30% of women are empowered and a high ICC of 0.2. Assuming a lower ICC of 0.05, we will have 90% power to detect a 13% increase in women’s empowerment.</p>

The questionnaire assesses whether social desirability bias or the tendency of respondents to answer questions in a way viewed favourably by the research team has influenced the data collected. We will train the field researchers in detecting social desirability bias in qualitative data and limit bias by properly introducing the study to the respondents, building rapport and asking context-specific probing questions following the recent framework described by Bergen and Labonté.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We will follow the process throughout the research.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The main goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of a combined nutrition counselling and unconditional cash transfer intervention, delivered on a mobile platform, on women’s empowerment in rural Bangladesh. We recognise that women’s empowerment is an essential goal in global public health and the key to sustainable development. It is therefore crucial that, in complex and large-scale nutrition interventions such as the SCC Trial, we measure pathways of impact across the domains of women’s empowerment. The 2013 Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Nutrition proposed using interventions that raise women’s overall level of empowerment.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Research has shown evidence of the impact of various development interventions on women’s empowerment.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42–44</xref> A 2018 analysis of surveys from 54 countries observed that in critical aspects of family relationships, four out of five women did not hold agency.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Cunningham <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> note that women lack not only the resources to make significant decisions leading to better health and nutritional outcomes but also, when disempowered, lack the autonomy and decision-making power within the household to make these critical decisions, having a multiplier effect on family and community.</p>
              <p>This study has several strengths; first, it is embedded within a cluster RCT that aims to assess the effectiveness of a nutrition BCC combined with unconditional cash transfers in reducing the prevalence of stunting. Another strength lies in the use of a mixed-methods approach—obtaining qualitative and quantitative data. We gain further advantage from the use of tools tailored specifically for this intervention; tools that are based on formative research, wide-ranging literature review and piloted in Bangladesh, providing accurate, comprehensive and appropriate methodology.</p>
              <p>The Pro-WEAI is designed to assess the impact evaluation of agricultural development projects.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> The SCC Trial is not an agricultural intervention; however, women in Bangladesh characteristically do postharvest activities and processing yet do not classify themselves as agricultural workers. It is in this context that we are using the index to survey women in Bangladesh whose livelihoods are bound to the agricultural sector.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Alkire<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> describes the Pro-WEAI as an ‘information platform’ that is applicable in broader contexts other than exclusively agricultural interventions.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The core elements of the SCC women’s empowerment index, a customised tool, will provide translatable results—using measures and indices that allow global comparisons.</p>
              <p>When the Pro-WEAI is used in full—women and men are interviewed—this enables the calculation of the Gender Parity Index, which measures empowerment and disempowerment within the household. The limitation of not interviewing men is that we may not capture the sense of intrahousehold inequality—are the women at least as empowered as the men in their households? We will account for this by ensuring that qualitative exploration delves into the extent to which the disempowerment observed is attributable to gender norms versus other causes. The SCC Trial does not directly focus on women’s empowerment nor contest existing gender norms or patriarchal power structures. However, the study participants—the recipients of the cash transfer, nutrition counselling and smartphone—are women. This study will identify where gaps in empowerment occur and will highlight key areas of disempowerment and which domains help facilitate or hinder nutrition outcomes.</p>
