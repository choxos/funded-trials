                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a common, costly, yet largely preventable complication impacting patients in healthcare settings globally. Improving routine cleaning and disinfection of the hospital environment has been shown to reduce the risk of HAI. Contaminated shared medical equipment presents a primary transmission route for infectious pathogens, yet is rarely studied. The CLEEN study will assess how enhanced cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment affects the rate of HAIs in a tertiary hospital setting. The initiative is an evidence-based approach combining staff training, auditing and feedback to environmental services staff to enhance cleaning and disinfection practices.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The CLEEN study will use a stepped wedge randomised controlled design in 10 wards of one large Australian hospital over 36Â weeks. The intervention will consist of 3 additional hours per weekday for the dedicated cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment on each ward. The primary outcome is to demonstrate the effectiveness of improving the quality and frequency of cleaning shared medical equipment in reducing HAIs, as measured by a HAI point prevalence study (PPS). The secondary outcomes include the thoroughness of equipment cleaning assessed using fluorescent marker technology and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Evidence from the CLEEN study will contribute to future policy and practice guidelines about the cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment. It will be used by healthcare leaders and clinicians to inform decision-making and implementation of best-practice infection prevention strategies to reduce HAIs in healthcare facilities.</p>

              <title>Introduction
</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par16">One in 10 patients in an Australian hospital will acquire an infection while in the hospital (1). This equates to approximately 170,000 infections each year (2). These hospital-acquired infections represent just a subset of the total number of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which include infections associated with receiving healthcare in all settings. The burden of HAIs is significant, with increased levels of morbidity and mortality and, for those acquired in hospitals, increased length of stay (2,3). However, there is little level 1 evidence into the role of environmental cleaning to reduce HAIs (4,5). Prevention of infections through practical, implementable and translatable interventions is of critical importance in the era of antimicrobial resistance. These strategies will not only reduce the burden and impact for patients and health services in the short term, but also contribute to limiting antimicrobial resistance and better prepare healthcare settings for emerging infectious disease threats.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Contaminated healthcare environments provide a reservoir for pathogens to be transmitted to patients. Admission to a hospital room previously occupied by a patient infected and/or colonised with a specific pathogen is a major risk factor for acquisition (6). This means that a primary transmission route of pathogens is via the patient environment. A seminal study published in 2020, conducted in 11 Australian hospitals (REACH study), demonstrated improvements in routine hospital cleaning being associated with a reduction in infections (7). This research was the first cluster randomised control trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of a cleaning and disinfection bundle that focuses on routine and discharge hospital cleaning on the incidence of HAIs. The REACH study did not, however, focus on the cleaning of shared medical equipment. This is a significant lacuna because infectious pathogens have been identified on shared medical equipment (8). Another Australian study published in 2018 demonstrated through whole genome sequencing that shared medical equipment also plays a critical role in the transmission of infection (8). This proposed trial builds on the REACH study findings, including important implementation strategies, and focuses on improving the cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment as a key strategy in the reduction of HAIs.</p>

              <title>Trial design {8}</title>
              <p id="Par20">This study is a stepped wedge randomised controlled study, conducted in 10 wards of one acute Australian hospital over 36Â weeks. A stepped wedge design allows all wards to receive the intervention at different times, with each ward acting as its own control. Each cluster will comprise two wards. One cluster will switch to the intervention every 6Â weeks. This study design reduces the influences of confounders such as variations in size and case mix and supports feasibility while maintaining rigour. This design also allows research staff to work with individual wards as they adopt the intervention, maximising consistency of intervention and aiding implementation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The stepped wedge study design.

                <title>Study setting {9}</title>
                <p id="Par21">One Australian hospital that meets the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. Ten wards within the hospital will be selected for the study.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec8">
                <title>Eligibility criteria {10}</title>
                <p id="Par22">The eligible hospital will meet the following criteria: classified as a â€˜Public acute group A hospitalâ€™ by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (9), located in New South Wales, have an intensive care unit, have a minimum of 10 wards, and caring for adult patients (i.e.â€‰â‰¥â€‰18Â years old) willing to participate in the study. Ten wards withâ€‰&gt;â€‰20 beds, caring for adult patients, will be selected for the study.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Hospitals will be excluded from the study if they do not meet the inclusion criteria. Hospitals may also be excluded from the study if within the study time frame (2023â€“2024) they are opening, closing or relocating, or implementing major environmental cleaning initiatives or changes.</p>

              <sec id="Sec9">
                <title>Who will take informed consent? {26a}</title>
                <p id="Par24">This project collects data associated with human beings only. Data from all patients (&gt;â€‰18Â years old) who are inpatients on one of the 10 wards on the day of the PPS will be used. As this project collects data associated with human beings only, there is no consent process and a waiver of consent has been sought and granted by the authorising Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). The approach taken in this study with respect to a waiver of consent is consistent with other multi-centre studies where a point prevalence study of healthcare-associated infections has been undertaken as the primary outcome (and data collection method) and ethics approval has been granted (1,10,11). Similarly, our approach is consistent with stepped wedge trials with infections as the outcome and interventions that posed low risk and collected data from existing records. In these instances, a waiver of consent was granted.</p>
                <p id="Par25">There are no interventions and no harm or discomfort to the patient as a result of the project. The benefits of the research justify any risk of harm associated with not obtaining consent. Results of the research are not individualised or patient identifiable. The study requires no direct involvement of patients; rather, it collates existing information obtained during their hospitalisation. No new information will be obtained about individual patients; therefore, results will have no significance for the individual welfare of patients.</p>

              <sec id="Sec12">
                <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                <p id="Par27">The stepped wedge study design allows each ward to act as its own control. During the control phase, the cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment are undertaken by PSAs according to hospital policies. The intervention phase introduces 15 additional hours per week, purely dedicated to the cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment. During the intervention phase, PSAs will be educated on correct cleaning and disinfection technique. To confirm equipment is being properly cleaned during the intervention, auditing with fluorescent markers (FM) will allow feedback to PSA staff. This design allows the comparison between routine (control) and enhanced (intervention) disinfection.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec13">
                <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                <p id="Par28">The intervention will consist of additional time dedicated to cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment, education on cleaning technique, auditing of cleaning efficacy and feedback on cleanliness to staff. This multimodal strategy to improve the cleaning and disinfection of shared patient equipment is grounded in the literature and recent research (7,12). The primary target for the intervention is the cleaning staff.</p>
                <sec id="Sec14">
                  <title>Additional cleaning</title>
                  <p id="Par29">During the intervention phase, each trial ward will receive an additional 3Â h of cleaning per weekday by dedicated cleaners. This is in addition to routine cleaning that already occurs. The use of dedicated cleaners will reduce the risk of contamination and assist in consistency in implementation. An expression of interest process will be used to identify cleaners who are seeking additional work. This will be managed and handled by the participating hospital, in line with enterprise bargaining arrangements and local policy.</p>
                  <p id="Par30">The additional cleaning will focus on specific shared medical equipment (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The use of a Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)-registered dual detergent-disinfectant wipe effective against a range of bacteria and viruses will be used for additional cleaning. The fidelity of the additional cleaning will be measured using the fluorescent markers (see the â€˜<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Audit and feedback</xref>â€™ section). In addition, items that have been cleaned but remain in storage until use will be labelled as cleaned, using bright labelling. This will enable clinical staff to easily identify which equipment is clean and ready for use.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Focus of additional cleaning</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Type of equipment</th><th align="left">Additional detail</th><th align="left">Frequency</th><th align="left">Estimated time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">Intravenous drip stand/pole</td><td align="left">Those in use by patients</td><td align="left">Daily</td><td align="left">5Â min</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Those in the storage on the ward</td><td align="left">Daily</td><td align="left">10Â min</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Infusion pump(s)</td><td align="left">Those <italic>not in use</italic> by patients.

                  <title>Education</title>
                  <p id="Par31">The dedicated cleaners undertaking the additional cleaning will undergo education and training sessions prior to the commencement of the intervention. Education prior to the invention will include at least a 1-h in-service, where cleaning techniques will be taught and practised. This will occur no longer than 2Â months prior to the commencement of the intervention. The training will be delivered by staff experienced in education and cleaning practice. Standard operating procedures for cleaning specific items of shared medical equipment will be developed and subsequently explained at the in-service (if they are not already in existence at the hospital). These will also be readily available for staff for future reference as needed.</p>

                <sec id="Sec16">
                  <title>Audit and feedback</title>
                  <p id="Par32">The benefits and role of audit, including the use of fluorescent markers (FM), in assessing environmental cleaning, is well documented (7,13,14). Audit and feedback to the cleaning staff involved in the additional cleaning will include the use of FM technology, in which invisible gel dots that are removed by cleaning are applied to surfaces. The dots are invisible to the naked eye, resist dry abrasion, and are removed completely by routine cleaning. A structured auditing approach, with staff feedback underpinned by education, will aid improvements in cleaning, as shown in multiple studies (7,13,14). FM auditing of shared equipment will be conducted fortnightly in each ward.</p>
                  <p id="Par33">During the intervention phase, audit results will be reported verbally to the cleaning staff, with a follow-up email to cleaning supervisors and the Nursing Unit Managers. Audit results will be used to inform further informal face-to-face education and training. In discussing audit results, informal goals for the next audit will be set with the cleaners. Additional reports will be provided for internal committees, such as the Infection Prevention and Control committee at the conclusion of the study.</p>

It is powered at 80%, based on a two-sided 5% significance level with an inter-cluster correlation of 0.3 and coefficient of variation of 0.65â€”allowing for variation in cluster size. A stepped wedge sample size formula was used, considering the number and size of clusters and the time period. The required cluster size is 132 (66 per ward), achieved with two wards forming clusters and three fortnightly PPS each time period (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰3960â€”5 clusters, 6 time periods). The baseline infection rate was determined using recently published work by the applicant and reductions identified in a recent RCT (3,15). Varying the intra-cluster correlation between 0.2 and 0.5 produced minimum sample sizes per cluster period of 94 (47 per ward) to 150 (75 per ward).</p>

The determination of a HAI will be undertaken through an algorithm applying the HAI definitions in the ECDC protocol (16). Data on each HAI identified will be consistent with the ECDC protocol. The attribution of a HAI to a ward will be determined through the use of a 48-h time frame, i.e. the infection symptom onset must occurâ€‰&gt;â€‰48Â h after admission to the ward, for it to be attributable to the ward. If a patient is transferred to a ward and a HAI is identified within 48Â h of transfer, it will be attributed to the previous ward. An interrater reliability assessment will be independently undertaken to validate the accuracy of HAI determinations (1).</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par52">The primary outcome is defined as the total fortnightly rates of HAI identified. The primary outcome will be analysed by a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with a logit link function, where the dependent variable is defined as will be used, to estimate changes in fortnightly cases of HAI. To standardise rates, the fortnightly numbers of HAIs identified (combined, all types of HAIs) will be divided by the number of at-risk patients. Models will have a random intercept for each ward to control for baseline differences. Fixed effects will include the intervention and study time in weeks and fixed effects for the intervention and study time. Study time will be modelled as a categorical fixed effect; inclusion as a linear fixed effect will also be tested. Models will have a random intercept for each ward to control for baseline differences between wards, and a linear fixed effect to control for unrelated changes over time. Intervention effectiveness will be represented in the model as a binary independent variable that will for the intervention switched from â€˜noâ€™ (0) to â€˜yesâ€™ (1) 1Â week after the start of the intervention period. This will account for a delay in the intervention effect, as wards become familiarised with the enhanced cleaning procedures. Model estimates will be reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence.</p>
                  <p id="Par53">We will undertake sensitivity analyses to determine the possibility of a delayed intervention effect of longer than 1Â week, the influence of each ward on model estimates and the effect of the intervention on the most common and serious HAIsâ€”pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections and surgical site infection. The delayed intervention effect will be modelled at 2 and 4Â weeks after each wardâ€™s intervention start date. The influence of each ward will be examined using a leave-one-ward-out analysis examining changes to the intervention effect and Cookâ€™s distances.</p>
                  <p id="Par54">Additional analyses will consider alternative model specifications if the proposed GLMM does not converge or provides an inadequate fit to the data. Planned alternatives will be testing of different link functions (identity, log), changing the distribution for the dependent variable from binomial to beta-binomial to account for over-dispersion, and the use of generalised estimating equations in place of a GLMM.</p>
                  <p id="Par55">To reduce the effect of confounders due to seasonality, viral respiratory infections (RSV, COVID-19, influenza) will be removed for the purpose of primary analysis. In addition, any HAI data related to an outbreak will be excluded from primary analysis. The study period is aligned to span over three full seasons (autumn, winter, spring), with the study midpoint corresponding to the usual epidemiological peak for respiratory infection in the region. Additionally, the use of historical coding data can identify underlying trends over recent years.</p>

audits</title>
                    <p id="Par56">We will analyse data from fortnightly cleaning audits using a binomial generalised linear mixed model with a logit link function on the proportion of equipment that were deemed â€˜cleanedâ€™. A random intercept will be included for each ward. The effect of the intervention will be tested in three ways: a binary intervention effect, to model an immediate improvement in cleaning; a linear intervention effect, defined as weeks after each wardâ€™s intervention start date, to model a more gradual improvement over time; and a combined binaryâ€“linear intervention effect. As per the analysis of the primary outcome, the intervention effect will switch from â€˜noâ€™ to â€˜yesâ€™ 1Â week after the start of the intervention period.</p>

                    <p id="Par57">The costs of adopting the intervention will be prospectively collected from hospital records, such as the cost of cleaning consumables. Excess length-of-stay estimates will be sourced from studies identified by systematic reviews to estimate the value of bed days saved. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated from the perspective of the hospital decision-maker. Cost-effectiveness will be summarised by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and net monetary benefit, which offer different summaries of the change in costs versus health benefits. Modelled changes in the primary outcome (HAIs) will be used to estimate changes in health benefits from cases prevented by the intervention, as quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to account for uncertainty in model parameters and its impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes.</p>
                    <p>Uncertainties in parameter estimates will be captured using appropriate statistical distributions to describe the variability. The fitted distributions will be subject to random re-samples simulated 10,000 times. The distributions of all prior parameters are used to estimate the posterior distributions of â€˜change to costsâ€™ and â€˜change to QALYâ€™ outcomes. The decision will be informed by plotting cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with threshold values between zero and 100,000 per QALY gained and using the net monetary benefits framework. These approaches are semi-Bayesian and appropriately account for all parameter uncertainty for the adoption decisions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par70">The CLEEN study is a large cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in an Australian tertiary hospital. The study represents the first randomised controlled study in the world to provide level 1 evidence on the impact of additional cleaning of shared equipment on rates of HAIs (5). The advantages of the study design include a simple and feasible intervention, with strategies built in to ensure adherence and fidelity. Unlike pragmatic trial designs, which may use existing resources of PSAs, we are able to ensure that the intervention is delivered through additional resources being provided specifically for the purpose of delivering the intervention. The stepped wedge design is another strength of the research design, as each ward will act as its own control. This negates issues associated with differing patient case mix, individual ward culture, operational issues and local practices. This study will provide evidence to inform the development of a future service delivery model, national guidelines and local policy with respect to roles and responsibilities and the importance of cleaning of shared medical equipment.</p>
              <p id="Par71">Limitations to the study may include issues such as hospital changes in policy or practice that may influence the outcomes being observed. However, the hospital is committed to ensuring that there will be no significant changes to the hospital cleaning policy during the trial period unless absolutely necessary. Other aspects of infection prevention control policy such as hand hygiene and antimicrobial usage will be monitored, and we will be able to document/identify changes in other policies that may influence the outcomes of this study. Further potential disadvantages of the trial may include that the intervention will only be delivered 5Â days of 7, due to physical and financial constraints. Given the intervention is being delivered over the vast majority of the working week, the burden and risk in the environment will still likely be significantly reduced. Environmental swabbing of the environment was considered; however, due to poor positive predictive value, it was not included in the current study design (17). In a related study in the same participating hospital, we intend to use targeted whole genome sequencing to evaluate potential transmission pathways through shared medical equipment.</p>
