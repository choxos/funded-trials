                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Road crashes continue to pose a significant threat to global health. Young drivers aged between 18 and 25 are over-represented in road injury and fatality statistics, especially the first six months after obtaining their license. This study is the first multi-centre two-arm parallel-group individually randomised controlled trial (the FEEDBACK Trial) that will examine whether the delivery of personalised driver feedback plus financial incentives is superior to no feedback and no financial incentives in reducing motor vehicle crashes among young drivers (18 to 20 years) during the first year of provisional licensing.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A total of 3,610 young drivers on their provisional licence (P1, the first-year provisional licensing) will participate in the trial over 28 weeks, including a 4-week baseline, 20-week intervention and 4-week post-intervention period. The primary outcome of the study will be police-reported crashes over the 20-week intervention period and the 4-week post-intervention period. Secondary outcomes include driving behaviours such as speeding and harsh braking that contribute to road crashes, which will be attained weekly from mobile telematics delivered to a smartphone app.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Assuming a positive finding associated with personalised driver feedback and financial incentives in reducing road crashes among young drivers, the study will provide important evidence to support policymakers in introducing the intervention(s) as a key strategy to mitigate the risks associated with the burden of road injury among this vulnerable population.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">Road crashes are predicted to be the fifth leading cause of death worldwide by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite early successes in reducing the burden of road injury, road crashes remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over the past decade, there have been no significant declines in the rate of road deaths and serious injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, an urgent rethink of road trauma prevention measures is needed if Australia is to achieve its national road safety targets of reducing fatalities by 50% and serious injuries by 30% by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Approaches to reducing road deaths and serious injury must account for the overrepresentation of young drivers in road crashes. Road injury is one of the leading causes of death among young Australians, accounting for 1 in 5 deaths among people aged 15–24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite only comprising 14% of all licence-holders, young drivers are involved in one-quarter of all serious crashes and remain over-represented in crash statistics, with the risk of a crash being greatest in the first year of a young driver’s licensure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">The FEEDBACK trial builds on past research indicating that feedback and financial incentives can reduce risky driving behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some studies found that personalised safety feedback to drivers led to improved driving behaviours, like reducing speeding and harsh braking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Others suggest that feedback alone may be insufficient to motivate behaviour change, and that feedback should be combined with financial incentives in order to deliver significant reductions in risky driving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Stevenson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], for example, found that the effects of feedback alone did not yield statistically significant reductions in risky driving behaviours, whereas feedback combined with low-cost financial incentives had a significant effect.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Similarly, providing financial incentives cannot be assumed to improve driving performance. Although there is evidence that financial incentives can motivate behaviour change – like smoking cessation, physical activity, vaccination, and screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] – the effects of such incentives do not always generate the intended outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Instead, incentives can create unintended consequences whilst doing little to influence the behaviour of already-safe drivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For instance, Mortimer et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] study found that providing and withdrawing an incentive completely offset the gains in driving performance while the incentive was ‘switched-on’, leaving affected drivers worse off than they started. These studies underscore the instrumental role of careful incentive design.</p>
              <p id="Par10">The FEEDBACK trial will use ‘smart incentives’: low-cost, loss-framed incentives that are personalised based on the drivers’ behaviour. Studies aiming to reduce traffic congestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], improve drivers’ fuel efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and modify commuters’ travel behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] all highlight the utility of offering personalised incentives – rather than static rewards to trigger behaviour change. Whereas previous studies have provided penalties (or rewards) whenever the incentivised behaviour fell beneath a <italic>fixed</italic> threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], thresholds for incentives in the FEEDBACK trial will be driver-specific and set to require (achievable) improvement relative to previous driving behaviour. These driver-specific thresholds will be progressively lowered – month on month – to incentivise further improvements, even among safer drivers.</p>
              <p id="Par11">Incentives in the FEEDBACK trial will leverage loss-aversion by imposing monthly penalties for risky driving, rather than rewards for safe driving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Penalties will be framed as deductions from an upfront payment to address differences in acceptability between rewards and penalties. This approach mimics a Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) implementation, where financial penalties are typically implemented as periodic deductions from an earned discount on PAYD insurance premiums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Whilst previous research indicates that feedback and incentives can improve driving behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], this study will also evaluate the likely impact of personalised feedback and incentives on crash risk specifically. Moreover, this trial marks the first time that such an intervention will be evaluated among young drivers in their first year of licensing in relation to crash outcome. This evaluation will provide policymakers with crucial evidence on the effects of population-scale interventions, such as insurance premiums being linked to safer driver behaviours.</p>

                <title>Overview of the study design</title>
                <p id="Par13">The FEEDBACK trial is a two-arm parallel group, superiority randomised controlled trial. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne (HREC 023-25244-42050-4), the Queensland University of Technology Research Governance and Integrity team (Project ID: 7478) and the University of Western Australia (2023/ET000616). It was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council Australia Partnership Grant (NHMRC; Grant number: 2,015,470). The trial was prospectively registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR; ACTRN12623000387628p).</p>
                <p id="Par14">The trial was designed to comply with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Trial findings will be reported in accordance with the Template for Interventional Description and Replication (TIDier) checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par15">Following NHMRC guidelines, a trial Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be established. The DSMC will be a multidisciplinary group who will have no involvement in the trial nor any conflicts of interest. It will include individuals with scientific expertise in transport safety research, statistics, and a consumer representative to ensure end-user representation and engagement during the trial. The committee will convene once per year to monitor the efficacy and safety of the trial. The responsibility of the committee will be to consider reasons for ineligibility and non-participation, adherence to protocol, intervention fidelity, study events, adverse events (those perceived to be related to the devices such as smartphones), withdrawals and deaths, and provide recommendations to the chief investigator about continuing, modifying, or stopping the trial. There are no planned interim analyses or stopping guidelines.</p>

                <title>Delivery of the intervention via mobile telematics</title>
                <p id="Par26">Vehicle telematics refers to an integrated system in which telecommunications are used to transmit information captured by sensors to record real-time data about a vehicle’s operations, such as speed, acceleration, deceleration, and GPS location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Applications of telematics are diverse, encompassing vehicle fleet management, vehicle diagnostics, insurance, and usage-based services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, the role of telematics is gaining traction as a strategy for providing personalised feedback to drivers about crash risk indicators, which include speeding (i.e., travelling above posted speed limits) and the frequency of harsh braking and acceleration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">While traditional telematics data collection relies on costly in-vehicle sensors, advancements in smartphone technology have enabled the capture of telematics data using low-cost smartphone sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, as most young drivers own a smartphone, smartphone-based telematics - hereafter referred to as ‘mobile telematics’ - presents a promising and affordable alternative for collecting telematics data from a larger population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Mobile-telematics technology will enable delivery of both personalised feedback and financial incentives in the FEEDBACK intervention by capturing real-time data on adverse driving behaviours that contribute to crash-related injuries such as speeding, harsh braking, and harsh acceleration.</p>

                <title>Study timeline</title>
                <p id="Par28">Each participant will be involved in the trial for a total of 28 weeks, consisting of a 4-week baseline period, 20-week post-randomisation (intervention) period, and 4-week post-intervention period. To join the trial, a participant will sign a consent form and complete a pre-trial questionnaire. Upon consent and completion of the pre-trail questionnaire participants will receive a link via SMS to download the FEEDBACK app. Once a participant downloads the FEEDBACK app and pairs the smartphone with their car (via Bluetooth), their participation in the trial will commence.</p>
                <p id="Par29">During the 4-week baseline period, the FEEDBACK app will collect data on the participant’s driving behaviours: speeding, braking, and acceleration. However, the app will not display any information to the participants during the baseline period (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). After the 4-week baseline, participants will be randomised (as discussed in Sect. 2.6) into either the control group or intervention group for the next 20-week intervention period.</p>

                  <p id="Par31">The intervention group will be entered into the same weekly draw and in addition, will receive personalised driver feedback and financial incentives as described below.</p>
                  <p id="Par32"><italic>Personalised driver feedback</italic>: Participants in the intervention group will be able to view feedback on their driving performance in the FEEDBACK app. This feedback is provided in the form of a ‘DrivePoints’ score, which is an average of scores calculated for speed, braking, and acceleration captured via mobile telematics for driving trips over a week. The DrivePoints score ranges in value between 0 and 5 and is colour coded as dark green, light green, yellow, amber and red, where dark green indicates the lowest level of at-risk driving, light green, yellow and amber indicate increasing levels of at-risk driving, and red indicates the highest level of at-risk driving. For example, for weeks with repeated instances of speeding, harsh braking or acceleration, the DrivePoints score will be classified as yellow, amber or red, depending upon the frequency and severity of each behaviour. For weeks with low or no unsafe driving, the DrivePoints score will be classified as light green or dark green. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows an example of how the DrivePoints scores will be visible to the participants through the FEEDBACK app.</p>
                  <p id="Par33">Each month the intervention group will receive an SMS containing their DrivePoints score for that month and a target score (referred to herein as the ‘safe driving target’) for the following month. Safe driving targets are calculated per participant and based on their driving behaviour in the month prior as indicated by the number of red, yellow, amber, light green and dark green DrivePoint scores. For instance, if a driver receives mostly green DrivePoints scores and no red scores but some yellow and at least one amber DrivePoint score in a given month, then their safe driving target in the following month would be to maintain their record of mostly green and no red DrivePoint scores but to also avoid getting any amber scores and to receive no more than one yellow score. The ‘safe-driving target’ for the first month (Month 1) will be personalised using the data from the baseline period. For every other month, the safe-driving target will be calculated based on driving behaviour in the month prior.

Second, the floor for acceptable driving behaviour could only be specified in the first month of the intervention period to ensure that penalties were applied for high and persistent levels of unsafe driving.

Monitoring participants’ driving behaviour during this post-intervention period will reveal whether any changes in participants’ driving performance persist after the intervention ceases.</p>

Upon completing the questionnaire, the control group will be entered into one final draw. The intervention group will be able to receive the remaining funds of their safe driving accounts via an e-voucher.

Based on crash statistics for QLD from 2016 to 2022, the incidence of a young P1 licence holder having a police-reported crash of any type during a 6-month period is approximately 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], with similar patterns expected across NSW and WA. Based on the findings of recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] the FEEDBACK trial intervention is expected to lower the proportion of a police-reported crashes from 3 to 1.5%.</p>

Allowing for a 15% non-response rate due to drivers who may choose to withdraw from the study, turn off their phones, or delete the smartphone app, 1,805 participants per arm, or a total of 3,610 participants, will be recruited to participate in the trial.</p>

This model provides valid inference in the presence of missing data if the data are missing completely at random (MCAR).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par85">Recent research led by the FEEDBACK trial’s investigators highlights that personalised feedback and financial incentives can lead to safer driving behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This trial will build on these findings by assessing the likely impact of personalised feedback and financial incentives on reducing the likelihood of road crashes. The FEEDBACK trial is set to be the largest trial of personalised transport safety feedback and financial incentives using vehicle telematics, globally, and will mark a critical step forward in advancing knowledge around large-scale interventions to reduce road injury.</p>
              <p id="Par86">Moreover, the trial is unique in that it does not rely on participants and researchers remaining in close proximity to ensure that technology is appropriately installed in-vehicle. As such, this trial is not limited to urban areas, but will deliver across three Australian states. The inclusion of rural and regional areas in the study is crucial, particularly as two-thirds of serious injuries and fatal crashes in Australia occur on regional and rural roads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These high rates of regional crashes are not only limited to young drivers, making the findings of the FEEDBACK trial significant for drivers of all ages.</p>
              <p id="Par87">In addition to accounting for the under-representation of rural drivers, the FEEDBACK trial will also generate important knowledge for decision-makers looking to address the over-involvement of young drivers in road trauma. As young drivers are at greatest risk of a crash during the first year of licensed driving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], it is key that road safety interventions aim to improve driving behaviour among newly licensed drivers. This study will provide evidence of a promising opportunity to achieve these improvements in driving behaviour, and consequently in crash risk, using personalised feedback and incentives.</p>
              <p id="Par88">Finally, the FEEDBACK trial has global significance. The findings from the research will generate knowledge that can be directly translated into transport safety policies associated with young drivers. Further, the increasing market penetration of technologies like mobile telematics highlights the potential for innovative approaches to transport policy around the world. This trial will demonstrate the utility of personalised transport safety feedback delivered using telematics technology and may spur data-informed policy development across the globe.</p>
